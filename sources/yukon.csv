The North Klondike Highway is a vital link that connects Whitehorse to several Yukon communities and important resource development areas. This funding will support the second phase of a long-term plan to upgrade this important highway between Whitehorse and Dawson City. The project will result in improved road safety, increased resilience to the impacts of climate change, the removal of seasonal weight restrictions for heavy trucks and increased economic opportunities for Yukoners.            I am excited to be investing in this important transportation link alongside my federal colleagues. This investment will address the transportation needs of Yukon communities by improving highway safety and road conditions, as well as bolstering economic opportunities including resource development and trade. This support will also make the North Klondike Highway more resilient in the face of thawing permafrost, reducing maintenance and remediation costs in the future.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Nils Clarke            Quick facts       The Government of Canada has committed to contributing $135 million to the project through the National Trade Corridors Fund. The Government of Yukon is contributing $45 million for a total of $180 million.  This funding is for phase two of upgrades to the North Klondike Highway. In 2019, the governments of Yukon and Canada announced $157 million in funding to reconstruct, rehabilitate, replace, and resurface critical portions of the highway between Carmacks and the Dempster Highway cutoff.  Reconstruction of the North Klondike Highway between Whitehorse and the Silver Trail will remove weight restrictions for legal loads year-round, meaning consistent and more reliable access to goods and services.  The North Klondike Highway is a key access route for over 50 per cent of Yukoners who live outside of Whitehorse.  Portions of the funding will also go to further implementing innovative technologies such as digital highway signs and electric vehicle charging stations.  The National Trade Corridors Fund aims to address transportation issues including those unique to Canada’s north.

The Mitacs Student Internship Program, which also supports innovation-related research that will benefit the Yukon economy, was launched last year through a partnership between Mitacs, the Government of Yukon, Yukon University, University of Alberta North, and ArcticNet. Current research projects include a host of areas important to the North ranging from food and clean water to women’s mental health, with the potential to support other areas with research-based solutions. Mitacs, a national not-for-profit organization that develops the next generation of innovators with vital skills through unique research and training programs, addresses the needs of industry and not-for-profit organizations by connecting them with interns equipped to provide data-driven solutions found within top post-secondary institutions. This year, the Government of Yukon is providing an additional contribution of $88,000, which will support up to 22 internships in 2021–22. Mitacs will utilize the Government of Yukon funding to leverage federal funds to increase the total value of the internships. The projects to date include:  Therapeutic recreation studied to mitigate COVID-19 effects on women’s mental health:  		Due to COVID-19, women have experienced greater unemployment, domestic violence, and caregiving responsibilities. In partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Association, University of Alberta researchers study the use of therapeutic recreation in the Yukon to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on women’s mental health. This project is located in the Yukon and is in partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Association.  		Find more information about COVID-19, women’s mental health and therapeutic recreation in Yukon territory.     Grow systems in residential buildings address COVID-19 caused food supply disruption:  		With Yukon-based industry partner Cold Acre, researchers from the University of Alberta studied how hydroponics — farming that does not require soil, but rather utilizes a porous medium—could be adapted to residential applications to shore up the North’s food supply. This project assessed the feasibility of farming inside residential units by having the necessary watering and fertilizing systems located within the building’s utility spaces, and the components for growing located within living areas.  		Find more information about the preliminary design of distributed hydroponic grow systems in residential buildings as a means of addressing market interest and food supply chain disruption due to COVID-19.     Purification of mine-impacted water by freezing:  		Researchers at Western University are working with Yukon-owned Core Geoscience Services Inc. to investigate and test an innovative, environment-friendly, energy-efficient freezing technology that is especially usefully in cold regions. The research supports the development of water treatment technology in the Yukon that utilizes cold temperatures; it has the potential to be scaled up and applied at mine sites or industrial sites.  		Find more information about freeze purification of mine-impacted water: laboratory study and mathematical modeling.     Mine revegetation in the Yukon:  		Mining companies are required to reclaim the land affected by their operations and revegetation of impacted sites in sub-arctic regions can be especially challenging. Through a community-engaged approach with Yukon First Nations, the YukonU Research Centre, Newmont Coffee and Minto mine, this UofA research intern is studying snow capture techniques with the aim to improve the growth of locally important plants for mine revegetation.   		Find more information about this revegetation research.             Over the past year, this program has benefited several Yukon organizations while providing post-secondary students with employment opportunities and valuable applied research experience. We are pleased to support further research to help Yukon businesses rebound from COVID-19 and explore new economic opportunities for the territory. I encourage Yukon organizations who didn’t apply last year to apply this year.       Yukon Premier Sandy Silver            Yukon University is proud to partner in a research program that addresses the effects of COVID-19 on northern communities, the environment, and the economy.

The IREI has already provided funding to 16 projects with half of funding going to a Yukon First Nation government or development corporation; nearly a third to community-based businesses or a public utility, and the remaining amount to municipalities. For example, $485,000 was contributed to the design and implementation of the Haeckel Hill Wind Project.  A range of technologies are supported through the IREI, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass, energy storage and demand-side management projects. Approved projects through the initiative must generate energy in the Yukon with proven technologies from renewable sources.

10,2021-07-27,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/construction-dempster-fibre-line-underway,Government Website,Construction of Dempster Fibre Line underway,"           Published 27/07/2021         The Government of Yukon has broken ground on the Dempster Fibre Line project. ROHL Global Networks, in partnership with Dagoo Services, was awarded the $67 million construction contract. More than 20 per cent of the contract value will be subcontracted to First Nations businesses. Crews are on site near Dawson City and officially started construction work on July 15. The fibre optic line will run along the Dempster Highway between Dawson City, Yukon, and Inuvik, Northwest Territories. It will connect to the existing Mackenzie Valley Fibre Link in Inuvik to create a 4,000 kilometre network. That network will provide northern communities along the loop with a backup line in the event of a service disruption and provide more reliable internet and cellphone services. Site preparation for the project began in 2020. The project has completed the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment process and the Government of Yukon received a land use permit from the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board. The roughly 800-kilometre fibre optic line is expected to take three construction seasons to install, with completion scheduled for 2024.            Yukoners deserve access to infrastructure that works and meets their needs. The Dempster Fibre Line will provide more reliable telecommunication and internet services for communities throughout the North. The project will support economic diversification and help grow the Yukon’s digital ecosystem while creating economic opportunities for First Nations and Indigenous groups.       Minister of Highways and Public Works Nils Clarke            I am very excited for work to begin on the Dempster Fibre Line. This project will connect Dawson City, YT, to Inuvik, NWT, and provide the Yukon with much needed internet redundancy. Our government has long recognized the need to connect every home, every business and every community to fast and dependable internet. That’s why we put forward the country’s first national strategy to achieve universal connectivity, backed up by billions of dollars in federal funding, including an investment of $59 million in the Dempster Fibre Line project.      Member of Parliament Larry Bagnell            ROHL Global Networks and our Dagoo Services partners are pleased to commence the construction of the highly anticipated Dempster Fiber Line and proud to further demonstrate ROHL’s ongoing commitment to the Canadian North. Dagoo Services is a newly formed strategic joint venture comprised of local Gwitchin First Nations Business People and a proven utility constructor, Put Put Contracting, based in Whitehorse, Yukon. From Dawson City through to Inuvik – let the build begin!        CEO of ROHL Global Networks Hans Bongers            All of us at Northwestel are driven by a vision of a highly connected North where Canadians can prosper and thrive, and that's why we are proud to be partnering on the Dempster Fibre Line. This project is an important step in our effort to improve telecommunications services in every community across the North.      Northwestel President Curtis Shaw            Quick facts       The Dempster Fibre Line is an 800-kilometre fibre optic line that will run along the Dempster Highway from Dawson City, Yukon, to Inuvik, Northwest Territories.  Project operations minimize environmental impacts by ensuring special consideration for the protection of permafrost:  Adaptive cable placement methods will be used to ensure the proper installation for the encountered ground conditions. The depth of the active layer of permafrost was measured during the planning stages and will continually be measured during the construction to minimize the risk to the environment.   The project will benefit communities in Yukon and NWT by providing a backup telecommunications line in the event of a service disruption.  The Dempster Fibre Line will be owned by the Government of Yukon. NorthwesTel will lease and operate the line for a period of 20 years.  This project is funded by the Government of Canada through its Connect to Innovate Program and Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program, as well as investments from the Government of Yukon and Northwestel.  Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.  $2 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity.  This project is supported with an investment of up to $30 million under the Government of Canada’s Connect to Innovate (CTI) program. Under CTI, the Government of Canada is investing $585 million by 2023 to higher-speed Internet to over 975 rural communities, including 190 Indigenous communities. The Government of Canada is also investing over $28.9 million through the Rural and Northern Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan.

12,2021-07-26,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/supporting-communities-across-yukon,Government Website, Supporting communities across the Yukon,"           Published 26/07/2021        This is a joint release with the Government of Canada. The health and safety of all Canadians are top priorities for the Government of Canada. Communities across the country are on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, and need immediate assistance to ensure their public infrastructure is safe and reliable. That is why the Government of Canada is taking decisive action to support communities and stabilize the economy. Today, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna, announced that the Yukon has received $17.25 million through the new Canada Community-Building Fund (CCBF) for the 2021–22 fiscal year, along with a top-up of $16.5 million. This top-up doubles the amount of money that Yukon communities received through the program in 2020-21, enabling them to carry out infrastructure projects that support the well-being of their residents. The CCBF provides communities with stable and flexible funding for their infrastructure priorities across a wide range of categories. For example, in Old Crow, the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation purchased new water and sewer trucks to ensure continued delivery of water and sewer services to its residents, and in the Village of Carmacks, the youth lounge was renovated and upgraded to continue programming in their recreation centre. In addition, CCBF supported improvements to a network of trails in and around the City of Dawson to promote active, healthy and inclusive lifestyles. In the City of Whitehorse, safety improvements are being made to sidewalks and crosswalks near schools and in unincorporated communities, as well as fencing upgrades around solid waste facilities to keep out wildlife.    As of June 29, 2021, what was once known as the Gas Tax Fund has been renamed the Canada Community-Building Fund. This name change better reflects the program’s evolution over time and will not alter or modify the objectives or requirements of the program. Fire halls and fire station infrastructure have been added as an investment category for the program. This addition will contribute to the program’s objective of building stronger and more resilient communities. By enabling communities to plan for their current and future needs, and build or improve the infrastructure that will help them thrive through any circumstance, the CCBF is a critical tool that will help ensure the Yukon remains among the best places in the world to live for generations to come.            The federal government understands the importance of helping municipalities invest in critical infrastructure like clean drinking water, broadband and recreational spaces. That is why we are partnering with the Yukon through the Canada Community-Building Fund to support projects across the territory that create good jobs, tackle climate and build more inclusive communities.      Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna             The doubling of the Canada Community-Building Fund will improve the daily lives of people in the Yukon, by allowing communities of all sizes to plan important infrastructure projects, while creating jobs and strengthening the economy. The flexibility of the categories allows communities to plan for the long-term as we work together through the impacts of the pandemic.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell             For Yukon municipalities, First Nations and unincorporated communities, the Canada Community-Building Fund provides reliable funding for projects that improve quality of life for Yukoners throughout the territory. This gives local governments flexibility to build priority community projects, or address repairs or upgrades to current infrastructure.       Yukon Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       The Canada Community-Building Fund is a long-term, indexed source of funding for over 3,600 communities across the country. In recent years, it has supported thousands of projects annually.  The CCBF has 19 project eligibility categories, including capacity building, sport infrastructure and roads. Communities can use the funds immediately for priority projects, pool the dollars with other communities for shared infrastructure projects, or use them to finance major infrastructure expenditures.          Backgrounder   Yukon’s 2021-22 Canada Community-Building Fund allocations and top-up amounts The Government of Canada is providing a total of $17.25 million under the Canada Community-Building Fund (CCBF) for eight Yukon municipalities, 14 First Nations, and unincorporated communities. 	In addition, the Government of Canada is providing a total of $16.5 million as a top-up, calculated based on 2020-21 GTF allocations to these recipients.

15,2021-07-23,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/canada-and-yukon-announce-major-expansion-10-day-child-care,Government Website,Canada and Yukon announce major expansion of $10 a day child care ,"           Published 23/07/2021        This is a joint release with the Government of Canada.  Every child deserves the best possible start in life, and all parents should have the ability to build both a family and career. Yet, too many families across Canada lack access to affordable, inclusive, and high-quality child care. The global COVID-19 pandemic has also made it clear that without access to child care, too many parents – especially women – cannot fully participate in the workforce. Today, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Ahmed Hussen, Yukon Premier Sandy Silver, and Yukon Minister of Education Jeanie McLean, announced an agreement that significantly improves early learning and child care for children in Yukon. Through the agreement, the governments of Canada and Yukon will work together to rapidly expand access to quality, affordable, flexible, and inclusive early learning and child care programs and services. In the recent federal budget, the Government of Canada laid out a transformative plan to build a Canada-wide, community-based system of quality early learning and child care that provides parents in Canada with, on average, $10 a day regulated child care spaces for children under age six. This plan will make life more affordable for families, create new jobs, get parents back into the workforce, and grow the middle class, while giving every child the best possible start in life.  Today’s announcement includes the creation of 110 new regulated early learning and child care spaces within five years to help ensure families of children under six years old can access child care spaces that meet their needs. The Government of Canada’s investment builds on Yukon’s efforts to date to ensure that all families have access to an average of $10 a day out-of-pocket parent fees for full-time regulated child care spaces for children under age six. This agreement will fund critical services, and attract, retain and grow a strong and skilled workforce of early childhood educators, including through greater opportunities for professional development. This agreement also supports the ongoing implementation of Yukon’s wage grid, which provides a minimum wage of nearly $30 an hour to fully qualified early childhood educators— the highest minimum wage for early childhood educators in the country. Federal funding will be exclusively used to support the creation of regulated spaces in not-for-profit and public early learning and child care providers, as well as family-based providers. The agreement will also support an early learning and child care system that is fully inclusive of children with disabilities and children needing enhanced or individual supports, and ensures all families have equitable access to high quality, affordable early learning and child care. The agreement also supports a clear commitment to continue to work collaboratively with Yukon First Nations to ensure Indigenous children will have access to affordable, high-quality and culturally appropriate early learning and child care.  Since 2015, through programs like the Canada Child Benefit which has recently once again been indexed to inflation, the government has been helping make life more affordable for families.            Strong educational supports for children of all ages and needs are vital for the success and prosperity of all Yukoners. This year we introduced the Yukon’s first universal affordable childcare program to provide Yukon children with access to affordable, high-quality childcare and learning opportunities. We are pleased to work with the Government of Canada to enhance this program and make life more affordable for Yukon families. Not only is this an investment that benefits our children’s development, it is an investment that benefits our local economy and equality in the workforce.      Premier of Yukon Sandy Silver            Ensuring all Canadians have access to high-quality and affordable early learning and child care is feminist economic policy and smart economic policy. It is critical social infrastructure, over 50 years in the making, which will drive jobs and growth. By working with the Government of Yukon on implementing the beginning of this historic investment, we will be giving every child in the territory the best possible start in life, increasing women’s participation in the workforce, creating jobs, and making life more affordable for young families across Yukon.      Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland            Child care is not a luxury; it's a necessity. Our vision for early learning and child care is big and ambitious, but our government knows that it's the right thing to do to ensure every child has the best start in life. Through this historic agreement, our government is working to ensure that all children in Yukon have access to the quality child care they need to succeed.      Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Ahmed Hussen            This historic agreement between the governments of Yukon and Canada will allow us to expand our new universal affordable childcare program and enhance childcare delivery in the Yukon. Together with our partners we are supporting early learning programs for Yukon families that incorporate on-the-land and experiential learning, local First Nation ways of knowing, doing, and being, traditional language learning, and more. We look forward to continue working with Yukon First Nations, childcare operators and educators to build capacity and deliver inclusive, accessible programming that meets the needs of all Yukon children.      Minister of Education Jeanie McLean            Quick facts       On April 1, 2021, Yukon introduced a universal child care system, part of a $25 million annual investment in its early learning and child care system. In addition, the Government of Canada will contribute a total of nearly $42 million over five years to build on Yukon’s efforts to date to ensure that all families have access to an average of $10 a day out-of-pocket parent fees for full-time regulated early learning and child care spaces for children under age six.  The governments of Canada and Yukon will create an Implementation Committee that will monitor progress on early learning and child care commitments in consultation with partners and stakeholders. The Government of Canada will be represented on this committee by the Federal Secretariat on Early Learning and Child Care.  Budget 2021 provides new investments to build a high-quality, affordable, flexible, and inclusive early learning and child care system across Canada. These investments total up to $30 billion over the next five years, and combined with previous investments announced since 2015, $9.2 billion every year thereafter, permanently.  Through previous investments in early learning and child care, the Government of Canada helped to create over 40,000 more affordable child care spaces across the country prior to the pandemic, including over 1,500 in Yukon.  In addition to these investments, the Government of Canada is directly supporting parents, no matter how they choose to care for their children, through the Canada Child Benefit (CCB). For over five years, the CCB has provided almost $25 billion in tax-free support per year to about 3.5 million families, and is now providing families with $350 more per child than when the program began.  Since 2015, the Government of Canada has been helping make life more affordable for families. This includes programs like the Canada Child Benefit, which was annually increased again this week to help families keep up with the costs of living and raising their children.  Investments in child care will benefit all Canadians. Studies show that for every dollar invested in early childhood education, the broader economy receives between $1.50 and $2.80 in return.  To promote greater gender equality at home and in the workplace, the Government of Canada has also introduced the Parental Sharing Benefit.

16,2021-07-23,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukon-municipalities-improve-recreational-facilities-canada-community-building-fund,Government Website,Yukon municipalities improve recreational facilities with Canada Community-Building Fund,"           Published 23/07/2021        Five municipalities are investing nearly $3.5 million of their portions of the Canada Community-Building Fund to upgrade existing recreational facilities in the Yukon.   The 14 projects in five communities will improve seasonal and year-round facilities around the territory. The Village of Carmacks is redeveloping their Merv Tew Park to provide new attractions for residents and visitors, including installing a new gazebo, disc golf course and relocating the playground. In Haines Junction, accessibility upgrades will improve access to the Pine Lake trail system. The City of Dawson is building and upgrading its network of trails. In Whitehorse, an accessible playground is being built at the Canada Games Centre and on Schwatka Lake, floatplane docks and new parking lots will provide improved access to regional airport and recreational infrastructure. The Village of Haines Junction used funding to replace the roof of the St. Elias Convention Centre to extend the life of this popular cultural events venue. As of June 29, 2021, what was once known as the Gas Tax Fund, has been renamed the Canada Community-Building Fund. This name change better reflects the program’s evolution over time and will not alter or modify the objectives or requirements of the program.             Through the Canada Community-Building Fund, we are building welcoming, healthy and connected communities across the Yukon. Having access to modern, quality recreational and sports facilities is a strong incentive for encouraging regular physical activity. These projects will have tangible impacts on the quality of life of families, and the vitality of our Yukon communities now and into the future.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna            Abundant recreational opportunities are part of what makes the Yukon such a great place to live and raise a family. We are pleased to see these projects moving forward. The Canada Community-Building Fund provides municipalities with reliable funding to enhance facilities for residents and visitors while helping to create economic opportunity in Yukon communities.       Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn            The City of Whitehorse is thankful for the support from the Canada Community-Building Fund, which makes it possible for Yukoners and visitors alike to enjoy recreational facilities such as the Canada Games Centre and Takhini Arena. These much-needed improvements help ensure that everyone continues to have a wide range of recreation opportunities in Whitehorse.      City of Whitehorse Mayor Dan Curtis            The Village of Carmacks was thrilled to hear that our three proposals to the Canada Community-Building Fund were all accepted. Merv Tew Park will see a major facelift with a new Disc Golf course, a new Gazebo and a Bandstand to host Village get-togethers once COVID passes. Parking will be improved to ensure the safety of our children and all the changes are designed to improve recreational enjoyment for our citizens. Our exciting new Official Community Plan is now complete and Council is very proud with the outcome. This funding helped us immensely by hiring wonderful, creative consultants to guide our decisions. The myriad of trails in the Carmacks area will be getting some much needed grooming and upgrading to improve the hikeability and likability, not only for our residents, but also for the many tourists that grace us every season. Thanks to the Canada Community-Building Fund, all of this was made possible.      Village of Carmacks Mayor Lee Mayor Bodie            The Canada Community-Building Fund helps the Village of Haines Junction to maintain, improve, and acquire additional recreational amenities.  These amenities are very important as they heighten the desirability of our Community as a place to live and work.   Additionally, it is very important to have this predictable funding, as it allows the Village to plan projects in a scheduled manner.      Village of Haines Junction Mayor Thomas Eckervogt            Nature trails have long been an important part of our community and have proven a godsend during the pandemic, when residents and visitors were looking for safe recreation options. The City of Dawson is continuing to build, expand and maintain our multi-use trail system and appreciate the flexibility of the Canada Community-Building Fund to support these activities.        City of Dawson Mayor Wayne Potoroka            Quick facts       Village of Carmacks  $295,000 – Upgrades to Merv Tew Park will increase use by residents and draw visitors to the park.

17,2021-07-23,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/update-august-1-increase-minimum-wage,Government Website,Update on August 1 increase to minimum wage ,"           Published 23/07/2021        The Government of Yukon is providing an update today to its commitment to increase the minimum wage to $15.20 an hour on August 1, 2021, and to subsequent annual increases tied to inflation. The government spoke to the commitment to increase the minimum wage in the Speech from the Throne on May 11, 2021. The Employment Standards Board has now reviewed the proposed increase and has issued an order setting Yukon’s minimum wage at $15.20 an hour effective August 1, 2021. The order also states that the minimum wage will increase by the Consumer Price Index for Whitehorse every April 1. The government is now taking the necessary steps to have this increase in place for August 1, 2021. The increase on August 1, 2021, and subsequent annual increases each April were first committed to in the April 2021 Confidence and Supply Agreement between the Yukon government and the Yukon NDP Caucus.            Our government committed to this increase to support healthy and vibrant communities in the Yukon. The Yukon’s economy is strong so it is a good time to make this change. By increasing minimum wage, we ensure Yukoners can afford the daily necessities and help employers attract and retain staff.       Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn            We have been fighting for an increase to minimum wage for a long time and we’re so glad to finally see it coming into force. The pandemic has shown that minimum wage workers do essential work in our communities. They deserve to be able to make ends meet. No one should have a full-time job and still struggle to afford the basic necessities. This is an important step in the right direction.      Leader of the Yukon NDP Kate White            Quick facts       This increase aligns with other jurisdictions that have already raised their minimum wage above $15. British Columbia, Alberta and Nunavut all have minimum wages above $15 an hour.  The Northwest Territories will raise its minimum wage to $15.20 an hour on September 1 and the Government of Canada will raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, effective December 29, 2021.  Yukon’s last minimum wage increase was on April 1, 2021. At the time, we raised the minimum wage from $13.71 to $13.85 per hour.

21,2021-07-22,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/government-canada-invests-more-whitehorse-rental-housing,Government Website,Government of Canada invests in more Whitehorse rental housing,"           Published 22/07/2021        This is a joint release with the Government of Canada.  Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. Thanks to support from the Government of Canada, the Government of Yukon and the City of Whitehorse, Whitehorse residents will now have access to more rental housing options. Today, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Ahmed Hussen, alongside the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages (Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency) and Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Ranj Pillai, Whitehorse City Councillor Samson Hartland on behalf of Mayor Dan Curtis, and Right  On Property Group President Dr. Sammy Hachem announced a $22.2 million investment to build three new rental buildings in Whistle Bend. Called Boreal Commons, the development is comprised of three buildings, with each three-storey building including four bachelor units, four one-bedroom units and 21 two-bedroom units for a total of 87 new homes. Eighteen homes at the project will have below market rental rates for at least 25 years and five bachelor units will be reserved for tenants between 18 and 25 years old. Additionally, at least five units will be prioritized for newcomers to Canada, and 18 units constructed with accessible design features to target vulnerable populations, such as seniors or people with mobility challenges. The project received funding through CMHC’s Rental Construction Financing initiative (RCFi), a National Housing Strategy program that supports rental housing construction projects to encourage a stable supply of rental housing for middle-class families in expensive housing markets.            Our Government is working hard to create more housing options for all Canadians, to ensure everyone has a home that meets their needs. Investments in our growing cities like Whitehorse under the Rental Construction Financing Initiative are crucial, and will help pave the way for a stronger more prosperous middle class. The 87 new homes at Boreal Commons are another example of the National Housing Strategy at work, I look forward to seeing this community continue to grow.      Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Ahmed Hussen            The Government of Yukon is committed to increasing housing availability by building on our partnerships and making strategic investments in healthy, vibrant, sustainable communities. Through collaborative efforts across all levels of government, we are working to increase options for Yukoners across the housing continuum and throughout the territory. I am excited to see new projects come to fruition and am proud to continue supporting affordable housing construction in the territory.       Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Ranj Pillai            The National Housing Strategy’s programs help cities like Whitehorse increase supply of much-needed rental homes. This investment comes at a critical time during the pandemic, keeping good jobs in the community and the regional economy moving here in Whitehorse. This investment at Boreal Commons is another great example of community building, helping Yukoners access safe and affordable housing that meets their needs.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell            On behalf of Council, I am excited to see more rental housing made available in our community, especially in our fastest-growing neighbourhood. We are proud to contribute to this project through a development incentive and we will continue to work with our government and First Nation partners to help people attain housing across the housing continuum.      Mayor Dan Curtis, City of Whitehorse            We are very proud to be able to provide new affordable rental apartments in Whitehorse. There has not been such a large residential project constructed in the community for more than 30 years. We realize it is only a small drop in the bucket to meet the significant housing needs and much work still needs to be done. We hope that collaboration between different levels of government can be facilitated in the future so that we can all work together to improve housing options in northern Canada. Building in the North presents significant challenges and we want to thank our experienced team at Kobayashi and Zedda Architects, Blackrock Construction, and all their employees who helped make this project a reality.        Right On Property Group President Dr. Sammy Hachem            Quick facts       Yukon Housing Corporation is contributing $500,000 through the third intake of the Housing Initiatives Fund (HIF 3); and $500,000 under the Municipal Matching Rental Construction Grant program (MMRCP).  The City of Whitehorse is contributing development incentives of up to $500,000 over 10 years to the project.  As of October 2020, the vacancy rate in Whitehorse was 2.5 per cent.  Through Rental Construction Financing initiative (RCFi), the Government of Canada is encouraging the construction of more than 71,000 new rental housing units.  A stable supply of rental housing is critical to ensure that more Canadians have access to housing that meet their need and that they can afford. This is a great option for middle class Canadians who are experiencing affordability pressure in many markets with high home prices and lack of rental supply.  Launched in April 2017, the RCFi has generated significant interest in the industry, which has led to an expansion of the program. Through Budget 2019, the Government of Canada increased the total amount available in loans to $13.75 billion.  Given the high demand for the program, the Government again expanded the RCFi in the 2020 Fall Economic Statement by adding an additional $12 billion over 7 years, starting in 2021–22. The program now totals $25.75 billion in low-cost loans.  Budget 2021 proposes that $300 million over two years (2021–22 and 2022–23) from the RCFi be allocated to support the conversion of vacant commercial property into 800 units of market-based rental housing. As the demand for retail and office space has changed due to COVID-19, some landlords, particularly in major urban cores, are facing higher vacancies. This is an opportunity for property owners and communities to explore converting excess space into rental housing, enhancing the livability and affordability of urban communities.  Canada's National Housing Strategy (NHS) is a 10-year, over $72 billion plan that will give more Canadians a place to call home.  To help Canadians find affordable housing, Budget 2021 proposes to provide an additional $2.5 billion over seven years in new funding and a reallocation of $1.3 billion in previously announced funding to speed up the construction, repair, and support over 35,000 additional housing units.

23,2021-07-21,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/additional-covid-19-restrictions-be-lifted-vaccine-rate-increases,Government Website,Additional COVID-19 restrictions to be lifted as vaccine rate increases,"           Published 21/07/2021        As Yukon’s active case count continues to decline and vaccination rates increase in the territory and across Canada, Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) has provided new recommendations regarding public health measures in place to protect Yukoners from COVID-19. Effective August 4, the Yukon government will lift the requirement for people to self-isolate upon entry to the territory, the requirement to wear masks in indoor public spaces and the requirement for physical distancing in bars and restaurants, allowing these establishments to return to full capacity as it was before the pandemic. Community Services Minister Richard Mostyn announced the changes today alongside Yukon’s acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Catherine Elliott. The Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health will continue to provide guidance on best practices to Yukoners. For example, the CMOH continues to recommend that Yukoners self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms, get tested as appropriate, stay home from work and school when they are sick, wear a mask in some instances and continue frequent hand washing and practising other good hygiene measures.              Protecting the health and wellbeing of Yukoners while also protecting the quality of life in the territory remains a priority for this government and has been a complex balancing act since the outset of this pandemic. After almost 17 months with restrictions in place, we are now able to begin lifting these restrictions and start living with COVID-19 as part of our day to day reality. Yukoners can begin to live their lives in a way that is more in keeping with the way things used to be.      Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn            We must target our efforts toward the greatest risk in Yukon right now: the spread from person to person, particularly those who are not yet fully vaccinated. The risk of importation from our neighbors has fallen dramatically with the end of their waves and their rising vaccination rates. In Yukon, we continue to see cases on a daily basis and this number is decreasing over time as well. In the future, we may well see small surges and even outbreaks. As we have done throughout this pandemic, we will respond to each risk as it comes, provide guidance based on the facts and together, we will move forward with our lives.      Yukon’s acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Catherine Elliott            Quick facts       The masking order was implemented in December 2020. While masks will no longer be required in indoor public spaces as of August 4, the Chief Medical Officer of Health recommends that masks continue to be used in specific settings such as physicians’ offices, hospitals and long-term care facilities.  Businesses may also request that masks be worn.  Yukon’s case count is stabilizing with the number of active cases decreasing daily while the vaccine rate continues to increase for those 12 years and older.

24,2021-07-21,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/location-supervised-consumption-site-confirmed,Government Website,Location of supervised consumption site confirmed,"           Published 21/07/2021         Plans for Yukon’s first supervised consumption site are underway. The facility will be located at 6189 6th Avenue in Whitehorse, a central, accessible location that will meet the needs of clients. The existing government-owned building is being renovated to accommodate the requirements of a supervised consumption site. In the coming weeks, the Yukon government will be engaging with residents, local businesses, First Nations governments and non-governmental organizations about the importance of the new facility. Supervised consumption sites provide a safe and supportive place for people who use drugs to consume illicit substances in the presence of trained health professionals. Like the rest of Canada, the Yukon is experiencing an opioid crisis and continues to see an increase in overdose deaths. Supervised consumption sites help reduce overdose deaths and increase the number of clients accessing addiction treatment services. The Government of Yukon is working to partner with Blood Ties Four Directions Centre on the operational management and programing at the new site. The supervised consumption site is an element of the Confidence and Supply Agreement and supported by both the Yukon Liberal government and the Yukon NDP Caucus.            We have lost far too many Yukoners as a result of drug overdoses. Opening a supervised consumption site builds on our government’s efforts to combat the opioid crisis and support Yukoners through a harm reduction approach. As we work to open this site, we will be engaging in conversations with local residents, businesses, First Nations and other partners in the community to share information about the value of this important space.      Minister of Health and Social Services Tracy-Anne McPhee            I’m so grateful for the work that community organizers like Blood Ties are doing to advance harm reduction in Yukon. This work is what made it possible to announce a safer consumption site today. Folks who are struggling most will have a safe and accessible space right downtown – this will save lives.      MLA for Vuntut Gwitchin Annie Blake            Quick facts       Supervised consumption sites do not provide substances for people to use.  Since 2016, Yukon has had 44 opioid-related deaths; 33 included fentanyl. Opioid-related visits to the emergency department made up 67 per cent of all overdose visits between 2016 and 2020.  Take home naloxone kits and training on how to use them are available across Yukon for free. Since 2016, 11,852 have been distributed.  Yukon will be the sixth jurisdiction in Canada to open a supervised consumption site, joining British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, Québec and Saskatchewan.  The Confidence and Supply Agreement (CASA) was signed by the Liberal and NDP caucuses on April 28, 2021. It is in effect until January 31, 2023.

Through the Department of Education, the Yukon ELCC contributes $700 per month, per child, as a direct subsidy to families with children attending licensed child care programs full-time. Funding will also be provided to the Watson Lake Daycare which currently subscribes to the Rural Sustainability program. For July 2021, the subsidy will be based on enrolment rather than attendance. The Government of Yukon is facilitating a full refund of all additional parent fees charged by child care operators above and beyond the usual subsidy for this month. This additional funding support will help to alleviate the financial pressures of child care for families. It also provides all licensed child care operators in the Yukon with the support they need to continue paying staff and providing critical and essential child care services. With the outbreak in child care centres now under control and most people recovered, the Chief Medical Officer of Health has recommended child care centres and family day homes can reopen today to all children and not to just those of critical and essential workers.            While Yukoners pulled together to help contain transmission of COVID-19 among children, our licensed child care centres continued to provide valued, high-quality services to our community and essential workers during this exceptionally challenging time. We appreciate our early childhood educators and the families who were able to make extra efforts to keep their kids at home. The health and safety of children and families is always our first priority and we want to support Yukoners by ensuring all costs for licensed child care are fully covered for the month of July.      Minister of Education Jeanie McLean            Quick facts       The Yukon Early Learning and Child Care Funding Program contributes $700 per month per child as a direct subsidy to families with children attending licensed child care programs full-time, and the subsidy is pro-rated for children attending part-time.  The Government of Yukon is the legislated regulator for licensed child care centres in the Yukon and is not party to any agreements made or contracts signed between operators and parents, including any agreed upon requirements for parent fees that exceed the $700 subsidy.  The total amount of additional funding support to families and licensed child care operators in the Yukon for July 1 to 31, 2021, will be calculated based on refunds to families facilitated by operators, who will in turn be fully reimbursed by the Government of Yukon.  This funding will support families who have children enrolled in licensed child care in July 2021, as well as 72 licensed child care operators and up to 300 early childhood educators and staff. There were approximately 1,500 children registered in licensed child care for the month of July.

The recipients are Inclusion Yukon, Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in, White River First Nation, The Nelson Project, Yukon First Nation Culture & Tourism Association, Larrikin Entertainment Ensemble and Yukon Aboriginal Women’s Council. Funded projects will be delivered throughout the territory and include:  supporting youth transitioning from high school to the workforce; cultural and land-based experiences for youth; a women and children’s retreat; a retreat for at-risk men; a musical about domestic abuse; and a taxi education safety project.  Organizations have adapted their plans in order to continue to work in accordance with current COVID-19 restrictions. Projects funded during the pandemic continue to adjust their delivery or have sought extensions in order to continue providing Yukoners with ways to reduce crime and provide services for victims.   	The next deadline for applications is 11:59 p.m. on August 17, 2021.

We are proud to support these local solutions and continue to be inspired by the flexibility and creativity shown during these challenging times. We encourage all communities to consider applying for emerging issues for new projects this fall.      Lareina Twardochleb, chair of the Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust Board of Trustees            Quick facts       The Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust provides funding twice a year to projects that are intended to reduce crime, prevent gender-based violence, prevent violence against women and children, address the root causes of crime and provide services and information for victims of crime or provide information about crime prevention and victimization.  Funding applications are accepted from municipal and First Nations governments, non-profit organizations and school councils or boards. Eligible costs may include wages or honoraria, promotional materials and printing, as well as materials or rental costs.  The Trust has supported Yukon community groups since 1998. Proposals are reviewed by the Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust Board of Trustees, which includes community members and representatives from the Government of Yukon, First Nations governments, women’s organizations and the RCMP.          Backgrounder   Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust spring 2021 recipients Inclusion Yukon was awarded $36,600 for a project called Transitions from High School. This project is a 17-month program that addresses the gap neurodiverse students face when leaving high school and entering the work force by providing both paid and unpaid internship opportunities to develop skills necessary for this transition and obtain work experience for graduation credits.  Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in was awarded $13,900 for their First Fish 2021 project. This camp will be hosted during the salmon run at Moosehide village, near Dawson City, allowing youth to be on the land for one week learning about salmon harvesting, processing, conservation, traditional medicines, foods and languages, as well as discussing traditional justice and what it looks like in a modern community.  Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in members and elders will also attend to provide guidance, teachings, stories and history. White River First Nation was awarded $55,185 for their WRFN Women's Summer Retreat 2021 project.  This is a weeklong women’s retreat to provide participants with a culturally safe space to share experiences, fears and advice – with access to crime prevention and victim support services. They will offer guidance on how participants, particularly children, can recognize unhealthy habits or traits that can lead to criminal activities, how they can protect themselves from becoming victims of crime and how the community can spot and address the root causes of criminal behaviour. The Nelson Project was awarded $51,756 for The Nelson Project: Connecting With At-Risk Men. This project will connect with at-risk Indigenous men in the Yukon through on-the-land gatherings to learn about their lives, their needs and their hopes for the future. At-risk men are typically hard to reach and hesitant to talk. Service providers do not know enough about who they are, why they are at risk, what they want, where they live, when they need support, and how they want to be supported. This project will help fill this gap and will establish a relationship of trust with at-risk men across the Yukon.  Yukon First Nation Culture & Tourism Association was awarded $25,000 for the YFN 2022 – Leading with Culture. This project is for part one of a two-part project in which Yukon First Nation Culture & Tourism Association will create and share an inspiring performance by and about Yukon First Nations people today. In 2021-2022, they will create a powerful performance by and about Yukon First Nations today, who are caretakers of northern lands and waters for millennia, facing unprecedented climate change that threatens our very survival on earth. The performance will be shared in 2022-2023. Larrikin Entertainment Ensemble was awarded $27,000 for Development of Blocked, a Musical about Domestic Abuse. This funding is for the development of a musical theatre exploration of violence against women – for women of all ages who have experienced abuse at any level.  Yukon Aboriginal Women’s Council was awarded $39,170 for Taxi Safety Education Project.  This project aims to improve taxi safety overall by decreasing the chances of criminal acts and/or victimization during taxi rides. The Yukon Aboriginal Women’s Council (YAWC) will hold focus groups with taxi drivers and with taxi ridership groups who rely on taxis to get around and who are vulnerable to becoming victims of crime because of certain risk factors. YAWC will work collaboratively with the taxi industry and organizations serving taxi ridership groups that are at greater risk of becoming victimized. This project will also offer training to taxi drivers, building upon and supplementing the voluntary driver training offered by Bylaw Services of the City of Whitehorse.

The first phase of construction is site preparation, which includes clearing and grubbing the site, and putting in a gravel pad. Later this year, thermopiles for the foundation will be shipped by air to be drilled and installed over the winter. Work on the building structure itself will start next spring. Planning for these facilities has been underway for several years. Engagement with the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation included negotiation of a long-term land lease agreement to build and operate the two facilities on Settlement Land. The 10-plex is scheduled to be complete in late 2022 and the Health and Wellness Centre will be completed by late 2023.            Investments like the Old Crow Health and Wellness Centre and 10-plex housing unit project are ways our government is building healthy, vibrant communities. These projects not only add to the modern housing continuum and replace Old Crow’s aging health centre, they also create jobs. I look forward to seeing this important work, complete with a passive thermopile foundation system, forge ahead.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Nils Clarke            The Government of Yukon is pleased to be moving forward with the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation on the Old Crow Health and Wellness Centre and 10-plex housing unit project. These are long overdue projects that will improve the services in the community of Old Crow. The co-location of both health and wellness-related services in the new centre is an important innovation. This complex will support the recommendations of the Putting People First report by focusing on more holistic, whole-person care with integrated, interdisciplinary teams.      Minister of Health and Social Services Tracy-Anne McPhee            The Old Crow 10-plex is a significant investment in housing in the Old Crow community. Designed as a mixed-use building, this project will enable us to respond to changing housing needs in the community. Supporting the vision and objectives of the Housing Action Plan and Aging in Place Action Plan, this project demonstrates collaboration between different levels of government to address community needs in the Yukon. This project will also boost the Yukon’s economy and generate construction jobs. We are excited to see families and individuals get access to safe, affordable homes and improve their quality of life.       Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Ranj Pillai            These long-awaited buildings will have a significant impact on our community’s health and wellness, and our current housing shortage. The first phase of construction is an exciting milestone for our Government and our people. We are eagerly anticipating the overdue replacement of our health centre, built in the 1970s. The new centre will facilitate a collaborative approach to health and social needs, while the 10-unit housing complex will help provide other housing that will change lives in Old Crow.       Vuntut Gwitchin Government Chief Dana Tizya-Tramm            This project means more than bricks and mortar to Ketza TSL Construction Ltd; the healthy development of our communities is so vital. A Health and Wellness Centre and 10-plex in Old Crow will not only benefit families now, but future generations and we are grateful to be part of the team for this impactful investment in the community.      Ketza TSL Construction Ltd. General Manager Eric Brohman            Quick facts       The design-build contract for the project was awarded to Ketza TSL Construction in March 2021 for $44.8 million.  A number of steel thermopiles are drilled into the ground to carry a building’s structural load while also extracting heat during cold winter months. This helps to keep the soil frozen, minimizing impacts to permafrost and providing structural integrity where typical concrete or similar horizontal footings are not feasible.  The Health and Wellness Centre is the first to be designed and constructed based on a generic functional program developed by the departments of Health and Social Services and Highways and Public Works for smaller Yukon communities. It will provide healthcare services including homecare, mental health, social services, dental care, telehealth and emergency care.

The spring 2021 funding intake received many excellent applications from a broad range of organizations. The CPVST Board of Trustees awarded $178,894 to projects with a crime prevention focus and $69,717 to projects providing services and support to victims of crime. The recipients are Inclusion Yukon, Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in, White River First Nation, The Nelson Project, Yukon First Nation Culture & Tourism Association, Larrikin Entertainment Ensemble, and Yukon Aboriginal Women’s Council. Funded projects will be delivered throughout the territory and include:  supporting youth transitioning from high school to the workforce; cultural and land-based experiences for youth; a women and children’s retreat; a retreat for at-risk men; a musical about domestic abuse; and a taxi education safety project.  Organizations have adapted their plans in order to continue to work in accordance with current COVID-19 restrictions. Projects funded during the pandemic continue to adjust their delivery or have sought extensions in order to continue providing Yukoners with ways to reduce crime and provide services for victims.   	The next deadline for applications is 11:59 p.m. on August 17, 2021. The CPVST reminds organizations that the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how some services are offered for victims. Applicants are encouraged to be creative with how projects will run in these unparalleled times. 	             Community-based projects that help prevent crime or support victims of crime are a critical way to enhance safety in the Yukon. I am delighted that funding provided through the Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust continues to support innovative projects that are making our communities safer and healthier places to live.      Minister of Justice Tracy-Anne McPhee            As a Board of Trustees, we would like to thank all the applicants for their commitment to developing high quality, innovative projects across Yukon that take action on issues of victimization and crime. We are proud to support these local solutions and continue to be inspired by the flexibility and creativity shown during these challenging times. We encourage all communities to consider applying for emerging issues for new projects this fall.      Lareina Twardochleb, chair of the Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust Board of Trustees            Quick facts       The Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust provides funding twice a year to projects that are intended to reduce crime, prevent gender-based violence, prevent violence against women and children, address the root causes of crime, and provide services and information for victims of crime or provide information about crime prevention and victimization.  Funding applications are accepted from municipal and First Nations governments, non-profit organizations and school councils or boards. Eligible costs may include wages or honoraria, promotional materials and printing, as well as materials or rental costs.  The Trust has supported Yukon community groups since 1998. Proposals are reviewed by the Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust Board of Trustees, which includes community members and representatives from the Government of Yukon, First Nations governments, women’s organizations and the RCMP.          Backgrounder   Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust spring 2021 recipients Inclusion Yukon was awarded $36,600 for a project called Transitions from High School. This project is a 17-month program that addresses the gap neurodiverse students face when leaving high school and entering the work force by providing both paid and unpaid internship opportunities to develop skills necessary for this transition and obtain work experience for graduation credits.  Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in was awarded $13,900 for their First Fish 2021 project. This camp will be hosted during the salmon run at Moosehide village, near Dawson City, allowing youth to be on the land for one week learning about salmon harvesting, processing, conservation, traditional medicines, foods and languages, as well as discussing traditional justice and what it looks like in a modern community.  Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in members and elders will also attend to provide guidance, teachings, stories and history. White River First Nation was awarded $55,185 for their WRFN Women's Summer Retreat 2021 project.  This is a weeklong women’s retreat to provide participants with a culturally safe space to share experiences, fears and advice – with access to crime prevention and victim support services. They will offer guidance on how participants, particularly children, can recognize unhealthy habits or traits that can lead to criminal activities, how they can protect themselves from becoming victims of crime and how the community can spot and address the root causes of criminal behaviour. The Nelson Project was awarded $51,756 for The Nelson Project: Connecting With At-Risk Men. This project will connect with at-risk Indigenous men in the Yukon through on-the-land gatherings to learn about their lives, their needs and their hopes for the future. At-risk men are typically hard to reach and hesitant to talk. Service providers do not know enough about who they are, why they are at risk, what they want, where they live, when they need support, and how they want to be supported. This project will help fill this gap and will establish a relationship of trust with at-risk men across the Yukon.  Yukon First Nation Culture & Tourism Association was awarded $25,000 for the YFN 2022 – Leading with Culture. This project is for part one of a two-part project in which Yukon First Nation Culture & Tourism Association will create and share an inspiring performance by and about Yukon First Nations people today. In 2021-2022, they will create a powerful performance by and about Yukon First Nations today, who are caretakers of northern lands and waters for millennia, facing unprecedented climate change that threatens our very survival on earth. The performance will be shared in 2022-2023. Larrikin Entertainment Ensemble was awarded $27,000 for Development of Blocked, a Musical about Domestic Abuse. This funding is for the development of a musical theatre exploration of violence against women – for women of all ages who have experienced abuse at any level.  Yukon Aboriginal Women’s Council was awarded $39,170 for Taxi Safety Education Project.  This project aims to improve taxi safety overall by decreasing the chances of criminal acts and/or victimization during taxi rides. The Yukon Aboriginal Women’s Council (YAWC) will hold focus groups with taxi drivers and with taxi ridership groups who rely on taxis to get around and who are vulnerable to becoming victims of crime because of certain risk factors. YAWC will work collaboratively with the taxi industry and organizations serving taxi ridership groups that are at greater risk of becoming victimized. This project will also offer training to taxi drivers, building upon and supplementing the voluntary driver training offered by Bylaw Services of the City of Whitehorse.

Feedback provided context to the industry’s insights on the existing programs, their perspectives on the proposed changes and what could be changed further. The changes seek to broaden the spectrum of supports offered through the program to better meet the needs and capacity of Yukon musicians. They include updates to align with the modern music industry’s standards and a broader scope of eligible activities, among others. Adjustments to the Sound Recording Fund are expected for fall 2021.            Our local musicians and recording professionals contribute wonders to the rich, cultural landscape of our territory as well as to our economy. One only has to look at 2019’s successful BreakOut West music festival hosted in the Yukon to recognize the larger economic importance connected to this vibrant industry. By modernizing funding programs and reducing red tape, local musicians will have even more opportunities to showcase their world-class talent at home and abroad.

Selkirk First Nation, Minto Explorations Ltd. and the Government of Yukon have released the Minto Mine Socio-economic Monitoring Program’s 2016 to 2018 annual report. The report offers insight into socio-economic trends related to the nearby copper-gold-silver mine with a focus on Selkirk First Nation citizens and the community of Pelly Crossing. The report provides an update on the tripartite Minto Mine socio-economic monitoring program and builds on previous reports from 2014 and 2015. Many trends in the report are neutral or positive for Pelly Crossing and Selkirk First Nation, indicating living conditions are either stable or improving. Key findings indicate that Minto Mine continues to contribute to Yukon’s economy and to that of Selkirk First Nation in a substantive way while increasing opportunities for First Nation citizens from across the territory. Minto Mine spent over $320 million in the Yukon between 2013 and 2018; $11 million of that was in Pelly Crossing. In 2018, the mine employed 23 Selkirk First Nation citizens. This has been a steady increase since 2008. The mine employed as many as 100 people during peak mining operations in 2015. The report notes that Selkirk First Nation citizens are increasingly employed in semi-skilled jobs at Minto Mine, as opposed to entry-level jobs. They and other Yukoners are primarily engaged in surface mining “and the skills required for surface mining are readily available in Yukon.” Key recommendations of the Minto Mine Socio-economic Monitoring Program 2016 to 2018 annual report:  Continue work with the Centre for Northern Innovation in Mining and Yukon University on training programs. Continue to engage in discussions with Selkirk First Nation and Selkirk Development Corporation on economic opportunities. Evaluate the impacts of the temporary closure and COVID-19 pandemic as unique events with significant impacts. Enhance the overall management of positive and negative socio-economic effects that may result from the mine.             These reports are the result of a strong working relationship between the Government of Yukon, the Selkirk First Nation and Minto Explorations Ltd. It is important that we monitor the socio-economic impacts of mining activity in our territory to ensure that local communities benefit. We support the report’s recommendations and we will continue to work towards increasing job opportunities for Selkirk First Nation citizens, addressing housing issues and delivering more education and training opportunities.      Premier Sandy Silver            These reports highlight our successes and help us focus on priority areas. Our government continues to work for the betterment of our community.      Selkirk First Nation Deputy Chief Morris Morrison            Minto Explorations is proud of the tripartite efforts to detail the socio-economic impacts of the Minto Mine Operation here in the Yukon. This report outlines the many contributions of Minto Explorations and is an important step in moving forward with initiatives to improve the benefits for all Yukoners and Selkirk First Nation. Minto looks forward to announcing new initiatives in 2021 aligned with recommendations contained within this Report.      Minto Mine President Chris Stewart            Quick facts       Minto Explorations Ltd. operates the underground copper-gold-silver mine located approximately 240 kilometres north of Whitehorse and 35 kilometres south-west of Pelly Crossing on Selkirk First Nation Settlement Land.   In 2014, Selkirk First Nation, Minto Explorations Ltd. and the Government of Yukon agreed to monitor the social, economic and cultural effects of the Minto Mine.   In 2018, the parties reaffirmed their commitment to the socio-economic monitoring program, and contribute to the planning of future resource projects in the region and across the Yukon.  Between 2016 and 2018, approximately 50 per cent of Minto Mine employees were Yukon residents. Of those, approximately 11 per cent were Selkirk First Nation citizens and 13 per cent were from other First Nations.  The mine closed in October 2018 and began operating again in October 2019 after Pembridge Resources acquired Minto Mine from Capstone Mining Corporation.  Between 2006 and 2018, cumulative operating and capital expenditures for the Minto Mine totalled over $1.4 billion.   The mine anticipates entering an active closure phase in 2025.  Findings from Selkirk First Nation’s Household Survey were included in the 2015 annual report.  A second household survey was anticipated in 2020 but was postponed due to the pandemic.

This plan includes more than 100 action items, such as:  improve access to Two-Spirit, trans, non-binary-affirming health care; provide public facilities with gender-inclusive washrooms with low-barrier access; and modernize and standardize how we collect sex and gender data are some examples of these action items.  The action plan follows an extensive public engagement on LGBTQ2S+ inclusion in 2018–19. It was developed collaboratively across government and also incorporates feedback from Yukon LGBTQ2S+ organizations, reflecting the government’s commitment to carrying out this work with input from the people who are most directly affected.            We know that LGBTQ2S+ Yukoners have experienced discrimination for far too long. This plan is a major step forward to reducing barriers, increasing inclusivity and forming more equitable government programs and services. It was a campaign commitment in the last election and an important priority for our government. The LGBTQ2S+ community has told us ‘nothing about us, without us’ and we are proud to have done this work in partnership with local organizations and community members.      Minister Responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie McLean            Queer Yukon Society is pleased to see the Yukon Government moving forward with the LGBTQ2S+ Action Plan. This Action Plan provides both a public commitment and a roadmap to address many of the systemic challenges faced by LGBTQ2S+ Yukoners in a strategic way. We are excited to continue working with government and our community to ensure that it is continually updated to reflect the needs of our diverse community. We thank the community members, advocates, and public servants who have worked tirelessly to help the Yukon take this momentous step forward.      Queer Yukon Society Executive Director Joe Wickenhauser            We are pleased with the recent expansion and coverage of gender affirming care in Yukon, which is one of the most comprehensive plans in Canada for the support of transgender, non-binary and Two-Spirit folk. We are excited to work with other Yukon LGBTQ2S+ organizations and the Yukon government to build on this momentum and to help make the Yukon a safe and inclusive place for everyone.      All Genders Yukon Society President Tharian Botting            Quick facts       The action plan includes more than 100 items under nine themes including healthcare, education and youth, community and culture, tourism, inclusive governance, Yukon government as an employer, public facilities, gender data, and accountability.   The action plan and engagement activities are part of a multifaceted approach to create a more inclusive Yukon for LGBTQ2S+ citizens. Continued engagement with LGBQT2S+ organizations, individuals, families and allies will help in updating the action plan as priorities change.  A progress report will be completed after one-year following the release of the plan to report back to the community on the status of initiatives. A public survey will be conducted within two years of the release of the action plan to ensure it is still reflecting the community’s needs.

The 2022 Arctic Arts Summit will focus on:  improving understanding, engagement and support for northern artists, organizations, and communities; advancing international collaboration around the arts/cultures of peoples of the circumpolar Arctic region; advancing discourse on Indigenous self-determination, sovereignty, and cultural integrity in Canada and internationally, specifically as it relates to Indigenous peoples of the Arctic, and strengthening relationships between the Canada Council, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and other Northern regions of Canada.  In addition to the in-person summit, a digital platform will be created to broaden the reach of summit programming by inviting more voices into the conversations and providing space to showcase more work from the circumpolar north. This platform will also be the hub for a series of events in the year leading up to the summit itself. More details, including a schedule of upcoming events, will be announced in the fall.            The Yukon is immensely proud to co-host this international symposium of circumpolar arts and culture for the first time in Canada. We look forward to working together with the Canada Council for the Arts as well as our many community partners throughout the North to create a truly innovative event that will highlight and advance the vision, voices and shared experiences of this unique region.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Ranj Pillai            The Canada Council is deeply committed to strengthening existing synergies and expanding connections with organizations and leaders in the North. The priorities we identify and the actions we take today to express and showcase the realities of the art and culture of the peoples of the circumpolar North, and in particular with Indigenous communities, are necessary building blocks to a more inclusive and sustainable future.      Director and CEO of the Canada Council for the Arts Simon Brault            Quick facts       The Arctic Arts Summit will take place June 27 to 29, 2022.  This will be the third Arctic Arts Summit.

This State of Emergency gives the Government of Yukon the tools and flexibility to ensure the safety and security of residents impacted by flooding in the Southern Lakes region. It expands the toolbox the Yukon government can draw from to mitigate the impacts of the flood, including issuing evacuation orders, as needed. With the rapidly changing situation, this step is critical to ensuring our ability to respond effectively to help residents in need. The State of Emergency will be in effect for up to 90 days and can be cancelled at any time.            The Government of Yukon has mounted the largest flood relief effort in Yukon’s history to deal with unprecedented water levels. The declaration of this state of emergency provides us the ability to provide effective and timely response to those individuals who need our assistance the most. We are aware that this is a stressful time for all Yukoners, and particularly for those residents directly impacted by the current flood situation. We want to reassure those residents we will do everything we can to continue providing all the support we can to you in the coming weeks.      Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       Water levels in Marsh Lake, Lake Laberge, Bennet Lake and Tagish Lake have all surpassed historic 2007 flood levels.    A robust Incident Management Team is in place in Southern Lakes with more than 60 Government of Yukon personnel, flood specialists from Manitoba and Saskatchewan and approximately 100 members of the Canadian Armed Forces actively engaged with the Incident.  If an evacuation alert is issued, it signals to affected residents that they need to be ready to leave their homes on short notice. We will do everything we can to ensure an evacuation alert is issued ahead of an evacuation order to give residents some time to prepare to leave their homes.  If an evacuation order is issued, it means affected residents are at risk and must leave the area immediately. The evacuation order may be issued without a preceding alert, if there isn’t enough warning.  If the Government of Yukon needs to issue an evacuation alert or order, it will be distributed through door-to-door direct contact with affected residents and then released publicly through a variety of means.  In the event that an evacuation order is issued, Emergency Social Services personnel and the Canadian Red Cross are on standby to assist residents as needed and to ensure accommodation and support for potential evacuees are secured.  If an evacuation order is issued, displaced residents will need to register at a reception centre either in person or by phone. This information will be provided in the evacuation alert and order.

This leave may be accessed by victims of domestic violence perpetrated by intimate partners or family members and by victims of sexualized violence. Yukon’s leave also extends to employees if their child, a person they care for or a close friend is a victim of domestic or sexualized violence. As part of the implementation of this new leave, the Yukon government reached out to stakeholders including, gender-equality seeking organizations, Indigenous women’s organizations and LGBTQ2S+ groups, as well as First Nations development corporations and local chambers of commerce to gather input on what employees and employers need in order to offer and access the leave.            Domestic and sexualized violence can be experienced by people of any gender, background or circumstance. We know that this type of violence affects the victim and everyone around them. These leave provisions provide victims with the time, flexibility and economic security to get the support they choose. Safe and supported employees make for healthier workplaces in our communities.      Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn             We recognize the startling rates of domestic and sexualized violence in the Yukon and we know this has to change. At the same time, we know that offering job-protected leave for victims of domestic and sexualized assault is the right thing to do so people have the time to heal and seek the services they choose for themselves.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie McLean            Quick facts       The leave provides five days of paid leave and five days of unpaid leave that can be taken in increments. If required, up to 15 unpaid weeks can also be taken with employer’s consent. Paid short-term leave and unpaid long-term leave will be available after 90 days of employment. Unpaid short-term leave will be available immediately.  All 10 provinces, as well as the Northwest Territories have enacted some version of leave for domestic violence. Yukon joins the six jurisdictions that also provide leave for sexualized violence. The approaches vary in length of leave provided and whether it is paid or unpaid.  Rates of domestic violence in the Yukon are three times the national average. Rates of sexualized violence in the Yukon are also higher than the national average.  Canadian employers lose $77.9 million annually because of direct and indirect impacts of domestic violence.

A boil water advisory has been issued for residents of the Southern Lakes, Lake Laberge, Kusawa Lake and Takhini River areas who use private wells or underground drinking water storage tanks that might flood, or have been covered by surface water contamination, due to flooding. The advisory is a precautionary measure to protect public health. The rising water levels means there is the potential for disease-causing bacteria and viruses, as well as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, to enter the groundwater. If you are using water from a private well that has been, or is likely to be, affected by rising waters in these areas:  Boil the water for two minutes (rolling boil) before using it for drinking, cleaning food, preparing food, baby formula or fruit drinks, washing dishes, making ice, or brushing teeth.  As the water rises, other contaminants can also be introduced, including oil from residential oil tanks. Residents who suspect their water is contaminated by chemicals, or notice their water has an unfamiliar taste or odour, should use bottled water for drinking and the other purposes. Boiling water will not remove chemicals or hydrocarbons. Residents should keep a 72 hour supply of water on hand in case water supplies are impacted by flooding. You can either store bottled water, which can be purchased from the store in advance, or fill clean plastic milk jugs (or other containers) with water.

Yukoners were asked to contribute their ideas and experiences with the Yukon Nominee Program to help inform immigration in the territory for the next 10 years. Employers and communities have played an important role in the attraction and retention of foreign workers in the Yukon by making the territory an attractive place to work, live and raise families. Immigrants also contribute to the modernization and diversification of Yukon’s economy, invest in businesses that create jobs and enrich the culture of the territory. Through the Yukon Nominee Program, prospective immigrants with targeted skills and experience may receive a Yukon Provincial Nomination Certificate, after which they can apply for Canadian permanent residence with the Government of Canada. Since the program was launched in 2007, over 2,000 nominees and their families have been nominated through the program ─ providing workforce stability and valuable economic and social contributions to the Yukon. The public engagement process ensures the upcoming Immigration Strategy will continue to position the Yukon as a northern leader in immigration programs that reflect the values and priorities of all Yukoners. The updated strategy will cover existing programs, like the Yukon Nominee Program and Yukon Business Nominee Program, along with proposed new actions to assist Yukon employers and newcomers as we work together to grow the territory’s economy. The new Immigration Strategy is anticipated later this year.            The Yukon Nominee Program is among the most progressive and efficient immigration programs in Canada. Nominees contribute significantly to the social fabric of our territory, invest in businesses and provide essential work that strengthens our economy. We want to continue warmly welcoming immigrants while updating programming to benefit all Yukoners and future nominees who come to live and work in the Yukon.      Minister of Economic Development Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       Yukon’s previous immigration plan was in effect from 2010 to 2019.  The Department of Economic Development administers the Yukon Nominee Program and the Yukon Business Nominee Program.  Immigrants are nominated based on economic priorities, labour market conditions and a strong likelihood of successfully establishing themselves in Yukon society.

Each recipient’s project details can be found below. New and existing community-driven initiatives are eligible for the grant. The next deadline to apply is September 13, 2021.            The Youth Roots Grant aims to uplift Yukon youth by creating healthy spaces where they can be themselves, where they are appreciated for who they are, and where they’re challenged to pursue their talents. Working together to connect families, schools and community members into a cohesive youth support team can make all the difference when it comes to substance use prevention. If we lift them up today, they will grow strong tomorrow.

One hundred and two individuals have recovered since June 1.  COVID-19 is being widely transmitted throughout Yukon, primarily affecting unvaccinated people and is now present in most Yukon communities. Eleven of 14 communities are home to COVID-19 positive people. Child care programs Several daycare centres are now exposure locations for COVID-19. Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health has issued a recommendation that, for the next 2 weeks, parents keep children home from child care programs if they are able to do so. This recommendation will reduce the number of children in attendance, allow for more distance between children and provide increased flexibility for staff to stay home if sick. This recommendation does not apply to day camps. Daycare operators are reaching out directly to parents of any children who were exposed to COVID-19 at a daycare centre. Whitehorse Emergency Shelter Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health is declaring an outbreak at the Whitehorse Emergency Shelter. An outbreak is declared when one or more persons tests positive in a congregate living setting. Approximately 15 cases of COVID-19 have now been confirmed in shelter guests and staff. Testing for COVID-19 is available for staff and guests on an ongoing basis. The shelter has a COVID-19 operational plan and is working with Yukon Communicable Disease Control and the CMOH to ensure practices align with the evolving COVID-19 situation. Update on access to hospitals In response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the territory, Yukon’s hospitals are taking additional measures to keep everyone safe, protect staff and patients, and ensure hospital care is available when you need it most. Here’s what you can do to help and expect to see when you go to hospital.  Only go to the hospital emergency department, if you need urgent care. New visitor restrictions are coming into effect starting Monday, June 28. No visitors or support persons will be allowed – with only a few, limited exceptions. Some non-urgent hospital services will be limited or postponed, so your surgery may be rescheduled for another time or your appointment for a lab test may be delayed. The hospitals may have to adjust or modify other less urgent services as required. You will be asked some additional questions by the screening team when you arrive at the hospital, please continue to be patient and kind, as they have an important role in our safety. You will be asked to wear a hospital-provided mask and keep it on in all areas of the hospital – even if you bring your own personal mask. This is to provide everyone the same level of protection.  Expect these limited measures to be in place for two weeks and reassessed at that time.            COVID-19 continues to spread widely in Yukon, mostly amongst unvaccinated adults, youth and children. We now have an outbreak involving the Whitehorse Emergency Shelter. This is Yukon’s first true COVID wave. We must pull together, by:  Staying calm, and staying kind; sticking to six - keeping any informal gatherings to no more than 6 people; keeping your contacts small and consistent; strictly observing all current public health measures; and staying away from others and arranging for testing when you have symptoms.

There is a high risk for spread of COVID-19 in any social gathering, and great care must be taken. Any organized gathering such as a wedding or funeral must adhere to current guidelines. Unorganized social gatherings should for now be limited to no more than six adults. Limiting our contacts for the next two weeks will help us take a pause and assess where we are.

Health and Social Services Minister Tracy-Anne McPhee and Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn were joined by Yukon EMS Deputy Chief of Clinical Operations Ryan Soucy to unveil the flight team and provide an overview of the program this afternoon at the Emergency Response Centre in Whitehorse. This people-centred program provides highly specialized care to the youngest Yukoners. It will result in shorter response times for these patients to southern jurisdictions, cost savings from reduced use of southern air ambulance services and enhanced obstetrical, pediatric and neonatal services in rural Yukon communities. Insured Health purchased the necessary equipment and Yukon pediatricians offered support and training to help launch this program, leveraging a strong foundation of critical care skills and knowledge already embedded within the Yukon EMS team. Now, in partnership with the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Yukon EMS is the only Educational Site License of the Pediatric, Neonatal Critical Care Transport (PNCCT) training program in Canada.            The launch of the SKY flight team is an incredible milestone for the Yukon, one that has been in the works for quite some time thanks to some truly passionate pediatricians. Thank you to all partners involved in seeing this off the ground. Your efforts will save lives and bring added comfort to expecting mothers, new parents and young children in some of the most stressful moments of their lives.      Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn            The SKY flight team program is an incredible step forward in providing highly specialized critical care to our youngest Yukoners. This is a transformational moment that will contribute to Yukoners’ health and safety, and I congratulate the teams who all worked so hard to get us here. Your continued efforts will undoubtedly save lives across our communities.      Minister of Health and Social Services Tracy-Anne McPhee            I am excited to support the SKY flight team program by providing training to the first group of paramedics. This team already has strong critical care capabilities, and their passion for learning really shone through while expanding their skills to provide this level of care to obstetrical, neonatal and pediatric patients.      Pediatrician Katharine Smart, MD, DTM&G, FRCPC            The SKY flight team program is all about partnership and we are thrilled to see it finally come together with the support of Insured Health and Yukon physicians. This is an excellent example of multi-departmental collaboration to improve the lives of Yukoners and contribute to healthy, sustainable communities.      Yukon EMS Deputy Chief of Clinical Operations Ryan Soucy            Quick facts       Previously, Yukon EMS depended on providers in southern air ambulance teams to transport children, infants and women with high-risk pregnancies. This often resulted in long wait times of 8 to 36 hours during critical situations and scenarios.  Thirteen Critical Care Paramedics in the Yukon are now trained and certified to transport obstetrical, neonatal and pediatric patients in critical condition via air ambulance.  The Department of Health and Social Services’ Insured Health program has provided approximately $175,000 in capital funding to purchase the required equipment for this program, reaffirming the government’s commitment to modernizing medical travel and the objectives of the Putting People First report.    In partnership with the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Yukon EMS is the only Educational Site License of the Pediatric, Neonatal Critical Care Transport (PNCCT) training program in Canada.

Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. The COVID-19 crisis has made it clear that affordable housing is key to Canada’s recovery for communities across the country, including those in the Yukon. Today, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Ahmed Hussen, alongside Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Ranj Pillai, Member of Parliament for Yukon, Larry Bagnell and Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, Kaaxnox, Dän Nätthe Äda (Chief Steve Smith) announced details of an approximately $12.86 million investment through the Projects Stream of the Rapid Housing Initiative (RHI) for the immediate construction of 50 units of affordable housing in communities across the Yukon. This funding will support four different projects across the Territory. Three million dollars will be invested with the Yukon Housing Corporation (YHC) to construct three triplexes in Mayo, Watson Lake and Whitehorse. These projects will contribute nine units towards supporting affordable community housing options for Yukoners. These will be a combination of one and two-bedroom homes, eight units will be barrier free and two units will be designated specifically for women and children. Yukon Housing Corporation will support this project with an additional investment of $2.6 million.    In Whitehorse, $6.07 million go toward creating 20 new homes for Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (CAFN) individuals and families in need of housing. The project will be located at 195 Olive May Way in Whistle Bend, and includes five separate town homes, each made up of four separate units including one, two and three-bedroom homes and accessible units. CAFN is investing $1.4 million in the project. In partnership with Ta’an Kwäch’än Council (TKC), the fund will also see $1.33 million invested to create 11 new homes across Whitehorse, helping the First Nation continue to support its members who are at risk of homelessness. TKC is investing $1.7 million in the project, creating opportunity for TKC businesses, new trades apprenticeships and other capacity building initiatives for the community. In Carcross, $2.47 million will be provided to create 10 new single family homes in partnership with Carcross/Tagish First Nation. These homes will target Elders and families, and consist of seven homes with two-bedroom units and three homes with three-bedroom units. For Elders, this is an opportunity to replace vacant housing stock in Carcoss, and allow them to stay within their respective First Nation. For Carcross/Tagish First Nation families, the project will provide parents with a long-term stable environment in which they can raise their children, and live within close proximity to their First Nation. Carcross/Tagish First Nation is contributing $923,000 to this initiative.  Delivered by CMHC, under the National Housing Strategy (NHS), RHI provides capital contributions to develop new, permanent affordable housing by covering costs associated with modular multi-unit rental construction; conversion of non-residential to affordable multi-residential homes; and, rehabilitation of buildings in disrepair and/or abandoned to affordable multi-residential homes. Investments made under the RHI are expected to support thousands of construction-related jobs for Canadians from coast to coast to coast.            Our Government is taking steps, right now, to ensure that everyone has a safe and affordable place to call home. Investments with our First Nations communities in Yukon under the Rapid Housing Initiative will go a long way to effectively support those who need it most by quickly providing 50 new affordable housing units. This is one of the ways our Government’s National Housing Strategy addresses the unique barriers faced by vulnerable communities such as First Nations across Canada. This is the National Housing Strategy at work.       Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for CMHC Ahmed Hussen            CAFN is happy to have the opportunity to build and offer homes in Whitehorse for the very first time, because we believe having a place to call home is a foundation for a good life. It is dän k’e – our way, to help those who need it most, so focusing on our people who face homelessness and severe housing need is important to us as dän shawthän (good Southern Tutchone people).       Champagne and Aishihik First Nations,Dän nätthe äda Kaaxnox(Chief Steve Smith)            The Government of Canada has made strategic investments to diversify housing options in the Yukon and continues to make valuable contributions to the lives of Yukoners. We know safe, adequate housing that meets the needs of families and individuals is a key component of healthy communities. These projects under the Rapid Housing Initiative are a great example of working in partnership to help meet housing needs in our territory while also supporting the Yukon’s construction economy.        Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Ranj Pillai            The National Housing Strategy is working to ensure more affordable housing for Indigenous peoples. At such a critical time, these developments will provide community members with safe, stable housing and direct access to supports and other resources to assist them in their journey to find safe and secure housing. The Rapid Housing Initiative shows us we have a massive opportunity in front of us to deliver housing, at a rapid pace, and it helps us to ensure we address the needs of vulnerable people and those experiencing homelessness in Yukon.       Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell            I see this initiative as a key step in Ta’an Kwäch’än Council’s efforts to address many different housing needs and interests of our Citizens. We thank Canada for supporting us during these particularly difficult times.       Chief Kristina Kane, Ta’an Kwäch’än Council            Carcross/Tagish First Nation was overjoyed to receive funding through CMHC Rapid Housing Initiative to build 10 houses in Carcross and Tagish. Our partnership with Walker Home Construction, a Yukon First Nation “Pre-Fab Housing” company, has been an incredibly positive and successful endeavour. As of today we have two homes ready for occupancy on July 1, and a further two on August 1. The remaining six homes are well under way and should be completed by the end of September.       Miles D. Dean, Director of Infrastructure, Carcross/Tagish First Nation            Quick facts       The Rapid Housing Initiative (RHI) is a $1 billion program to help address urgent housing needs of vulnerable Canadians, especially in the context of COVID-19, through the rapid construction of affordable housing.  Budget 2021 provides an additional $1.5 billion for the RHI in 2021–22 to address the urgent housing needs of vulnerable Canadians by providing them with adequate affordable housing, bringing the RHI to $2.5 billion total.  Under the RHI Projects Stream, $500 million was available through an application-based process, which closed on December 31, 2020. Funding was available to provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous governing bodies and organizations, and non-profit organizations.  The RHI Major Cities Stream provided $500 million in immediate support to 15 pre-determined municipalities that were identified in consultation with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM), based on highest levels of renters in severe housing need and people experiencing homelessness.    Nationally, at over 4,700 units, the RHI has exceeded its initial target of building 3,000 permanent affordable housing units thanks to the support of the provincial, territorial and municipal governments as well as Indigenous governing bodies.  Overall, new funding in Budget 2021 for the RHI will add a minimum of 4,500 new affordable units to Canada’s housing supply, building on the 4,700 units already funded.  The RHI has received significant interest from Indigenous groups, which resulted in nearly 40 per cent of all units created under the program to be targeted to Indigenous peoples.   The RHI takes a human rights-based approach to housing, serving people experiencing or at risk of homelessness and others who are among the most vulnerable, including: women and children fleeing domestic violence, seniors, young adults, Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, people dealing with mental health and addiction issues, veterans, LGBTQ2S+, racialized groups, Black Canadians, and recent immigrants or refugees.   Canada's National Housing Strategy (NHS) is a 10-year, over $72 billion plan that will give more Canadians a place to call home.

The plan provides the framework to ensure certainty for the land base, sustainable harvest levels and local economic opportunities from timber and non-timber forest resources, while integrating ecological, traditional, heritage and other community values. The new plan will assist Yukoners in completing important work on habitat protection, wildfire suppression and small scale forest industry development in the region. It also identifies forestry zones which guide where, how, and when timber harvesting may take place in the Whitehorse and Southern Lakes region.            After many years of collaboration between participating governments, industry representatives and citizens around Whitehorse and the Southern Lakes, we are pleased to announce the release of the Whitehorse and Southern Lakes Forest Resources Management Plan. The plan will help  governments and local communities address important work, such as wildfire hazard reduction, habitat protection and development opportunities for the forest sector, while honouring the shared values Yukoners hold for our forests.      Energy Mines and Resources Minister John Streicker            The Southern Lakes region covers a vast area. Habitat protection, wildfire suppression and future industrial developments are of critical importance to our government. As we share these important land resources with Kwanlin Dün First Nation, Carcross/Tagish First Nation and Taku River Tlingit First Nation, this plan is a good beginning to ensure our First Nations are included in all phases of any future planning for these important ecosystems.      Chief Kristina Kane, Ta’an Kwäch’än Council            How we walk with the land and water is central to our way of life and resource management. Balancing the sustainability of our environment with economic opportunities can be challenging, but is vitally important in modern times.

The total amount of land withdrawn accounts for 44.7 per cent of the planning area. The draft plan known as ‘On the Land We Walk Together‘/ ‘Nän käk ndä tr'ädäl,’ identifies areas where interim mineral staking withdrawals will help protect wildlife habitat, wetlands and other key areas within the planning region during the planning process. The Commission will engage the public on the draft plan in the summer and early fall of 2021. Anyone with an interest in the Dawson region is encouraged to provide their comments and feedback during the engagement period to help inform the final recommended plan. The Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in and the Government of Yukon along with the Commission are collaboratively developing the Dawson Regional Land Use Plan. All three parties agreed that there should be an interim withdrawal of mineral staking in high conservation value areas identified in the draft plan. The withdrawals will be in effect for one year and may change after the Dawson Regional Land Use Planning Commission releases their recommended and final plans. Existing claim holders with claims in the withdrawn areas can continue to work their claims during the period of the interim withdrawal.            Today, we are one step closer to completing a land use plan for the Dawson region and honouring the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Final Agreement. These interim withdrawals will help ensure that wildlife, wetlands and key conservation areas remain protected during the land use planning process, and will minimize land use conflicts in conservation areas identified by the Commission during the planning process. I want to thank the Dawson Regional Land Use Planning Commission for their efforts along with all those who have provided their feedback so far. I encourage all Yukoners to review and comment on the draft plan released today.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources John Streicker            Quick facts       The Government of Yukon and Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in formed the Dawson Regional Land Use Planning Commission in December 2018 to achieve the objectives of Chapter 11 of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Final Agreement.  The Dawson planning region covers about 40,000 square kilometres in the northwestern part of the Yukon.  The interim staking withdrawals made today equal 39.4 per cent of the planning area, with an additional 5.3 per cent of the planning area already withdrawn by Tombstone Territorial Park.  The draft plan is the starting point for the next step in the commission’s planning process to develop a recommended plan. The recommend plan is expected to be complete by 2022.

The Government of Yukon and Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in would like to thank the Dawson Regional Land Use Planning Commission for their continued dedication and hard work on the final draft plan that was released publicly today. The draft plan, known as ‘On the Land We Walk Together‘/ ‘Nän käk ndä tr'ädäl,’ identifies areas where interim withdrawals are recommended to protect key protected and conservation areas within the planning region during the planning process. Additionally, the draft plan identifies potential Integrated Stewardship areas to incorporate sustainable economic activity. The next step in the Commission’s planning process is to develop a recommended plan. The Commission will engage the public on the draft plan over the summer and early fall of 2021. Anyone with an interest in the Dawson region is encouraged to provide their comments and feedback during the engagement period.            We are very pleased with the progress that has been made towards a Dawson Regional Land Use Plan since the Commission resumed its work in 2019. The release of the draft plan provides an important opportunity for Yukoners to provide feedback on the future of the Dawson region. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, the Commission and the community on developing a sustainable regional plan that balances conservation of the land, water and wildlife, with cultural and economic interests in the region.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources John Streicker            The work that has been done by the Dawson Regional Land Use Planning Commission to date is remarkable. Together we are approaching a plan that provides for protection and conservation but recognizes important economic drivers in the region. We encourage all Yukoners to provide their input on the draft plan and we look forward to taking the next steps on this important file together with Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, the Commission and the community.      Minister of Environment Nils Clarke            The draft plan is a significant step towards protecting essential environmental and cultural integrity values within the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in homeland. We commend the Commission for their vision and thoroughness, and look forward to working with the Government of Yukon to manage the Dawson Planning region in accordance with the direction and intent articulated in the draft plan.      Hähké/Chief Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Roberta Joseph            Quick facts       The Government of Yukon and Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in formed the Dawson Regional Land Use Planning Commission in December 2018 to achieve the objectives of Chapter 11 of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Final Agreement.  Including Tombstone Park, the final draft plan identifies 44.7 per cent of the planning area as high conservation value land.  The draft plan divides the planning region into 21 Landscape Units, each of which its own management intent.  Thirty-nine per cent of the region is designated Special Management Area, for which either interim or permanent mineral withdrawal is recommended.  Fifty-five per cent of the region is designated Integrated Stewardship Area, in which industrial development is permitted under specific terms and conditions.  Six per cent of the region is comprised of Tombstone Park, for which a Management Plan already exists, and the Dawson Community Planning area, for which a separate planning process is proposed.  The draft plan is the starting point for the next step in the Commission’s planning process: to develop a recommended plan. The recommend plan is expected to be complete by 2022.  In the summer and early fall 2021, the commission will host community workshops and accept public comments on the draft plan through their community engagement website to help develop the recommended plan.

As far as the authors know, this is the first instance where castoreum has been identified in an ancient archaeological context. The two-metre-long artifact was discovered melting free from alpine ice in the Traditional Territories of the Carcross/Tagish First Nation and the Kwanlin Dün First Nation in the fall of 2018. The research study began when Valery Monahan, Yukon Museums Conservator and study co-author, found an unusual orange residue coating the sinews and wood at locations where different parts of the artifact were bound together. Analysis of these residues showed the substance was castoreum, a secretion beavers use to scent-mark their territory. Whether this substance was being applied as a preservative, an adhesive or a colourant is not known, but the use of beaver products by First Nations people in the subarctic north is renowned. Similar studies of Yukon ice patch artifacts have previously identified a mix of spruce resin and red ochre applied as an adhesive. This discovery demonstrates yet again the sophisticated knowledge Yukon’s ancient First Nations people had about their environment, lands and resources. This knowledge allowed them to use a dynamic suite of materials to create and maintain the technologies that sustained them throughout the year.            Working in partnership with the six First Nations within whose Traditional Territories the ice patches are located has yielded unprecedented findings of ancient hunting tools and artifacts. These discoveries have led to a greater understanding of Yukon’s past. The study’s finding is testament to the incredible preservation of these artifacts and the information they hold, and illustrates just how much there is still to learn about how Yukon’s first peoples lived.       Minister of Tourism and Culture Ranj Pillai            Our ancestors were connected to the land, the water, and the animals in our Traditional Territories. They understood how to use the things around them to design complex and ingenious tools, like the atlatl. Shä̀w níthän to all of the people who worked together to bring this ancient technology into the light so our people can continue to learn from the knowledge of our ancestors.       Kwanlin Dün First Nation Chief Doris Bill            Our lands hold many secrets and insights into the past. Unearthing and studying these findings is valuable not just from a scientific and historic perspective, but culturally. Walking hand in hand with the land, water and wildlife is the history of our people. Their resourcefulness and ingenuity continue to impress and teach us. Gunalchéesh to the people helping keep us connected to our ancestors.      Carcross/Tagish First Nation Haa Sha du Hen Lynda Dickson            Quick facts       The Yukon Ice Patch Research Project is a collaborative initiative between the Carcross/Tagish First Nation, Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, Kluane First Nation, Kwanlin Dün First Nation, Ta’an Kwäch’än Council, Teslin Tlingit Council and the Government of Yukon.  Castoreum is a secretion produced in the castor sacs of beavers and is used to mark their territory. Comparative modern castoreum samples were provided by Peter Knamiller of Yukon’s Department of Environment.  The site where this artifact was found is on Canada’s Tentative List of sites to be nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Throwing darts, which were thrown using a lever-like handle, were the preferred hunting projectile used by First Nations people in Yukon before the 7th century AD. They were locally replaced as a hunting weapon by bows and arrows around 847 AD.

The Gamma variant has been identified in this outbreak. There are now 18 active cases and Yukon’s total case count is at 104. The outbreak is linked to youth and adults who are not yet vaccinated. It includes participants at both organized and informal events linked to high school graduation, as well as adults who are socializing in close proximity such as at bars and house parties. The outbreak includes 18 cases; 15 cases are in Whitehorse and three are in rural Yukon. There are no new public exposure notifications. Of the six new cases:  all are linked to this outbreak; and all are self-isolating and recovering at home.  How to protect yourself and others from spreading COVID-19  All contacts of a person with COVID-19 must isolate for an entire 14 days since last exposure. Contacts who are fully vaccinated must isolate only if they are a household contact of a person with COVID-19. A household contact is defined as living with a case or having direct physical contact (e.g. caregiver, partner) even if not living with an individual. Contact means sharing saliva, or coughing on another person, talking for 15 minutes without physical distancing and other similar types of shared activities.  *If you are given advice by Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) that is different from this, please follow their advice as the health professionals. People with symptoms With current active cases in Yukon, testing for COVID-19 infection is more important than ever in order to identify possible community spread. People who are vaccinated may acquire COVID-19 in rare circumstances and should seek testing if symptoms develop. Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 36 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be accessed online at https://service.yukon.ca/forms/en/get-covid19-test-result.

Minister of Health and Social Services Tracy-Anne McPhee            An outbreak among people who are not yet vaccinated is concerning and we are very likely to see more cases in the coming days. It is now more important than ever that people in Whitehorse follow the Safe 6 + 1, that people with symptoms isolate and get tested, and that we all get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Gamma (P.1) variant is highly transmissible in groups who are not yet vaccinated. The vaccine is protective.

This is a significant and ongoing cultural and spiritual sacrifice from Yukon First Nation people. “Despite these efforts, run sizes continue to decline. It is only through cooperation, shared knowledge, and respect for both fish and people on either side of the border that we can combat the threats this species faces from climate change, contaminants and impacts from land and water use. “It has become clear that the current Yukon River salmon management regime is failing to reverse the declining Yukon salmon returns. Protecting wild salmon is central to preserving the cultural and social fabric as well as way of life in Yukon. We must all do our part to make sure this precious natural resource persists, now and for future generations.”      Quick facts       Fisheries and Oceans Canada has stated the 2021 outlook for the Canadian harvest share could be less than 1,400 Chinook, which is about less than a fifth of a full First Nation fishery allocation.  The extent of Alaska’s harvest restrictions depend on in-season counts of salmon passing up the river. Like Yukon, Alaska has not opened a public, sport or commercial fishery for Chinook for a number of years. However, their subsistence fishery is much larger and is not restricted to Indigenous Peoples.  Even if this year’s escapement goal for Canadian-origin Chinook salmon is met, it is highly unlikely the Yukon River’s productive capacity is able to meet the demand for subsistence harvesters on either side of the border.

The Putting People First and Our Clean Future plans outline significant initiatives for the Yukon government over the coming decade and were endorsed by all three territorial political parties during the 2021 election. The Putting People First report lays out how to transform Yukon’s health and social services system into a more integrated, collaborative and person-centred system that will better meet the needs of Yukoners. It was endorsed by the Yukon government in August, 2020. 76 recommendations included in the report identify changes to make services more effective, provide better value for money and improve outcomes and experiences for clients, patients, families and health and social service providers. Our Clean Future: A Yukon strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy was endorsed and released by the Yukon government in September, 2020. The Yukon-wide strategy outlines actions the Government of Yukon and its partners across the territory will take to address the impacts of climate change while building a green economy and ensuring Yukoners can access reliable, affordable and renewable energy. The strategy includes targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve resilience to the impacts of climate change. The new committees are tasked with overseeing and reporting on progress of this work. Each committee includes a representative from the Yukon Liberal government and the New Democratic Party Caucus and will report out twice annually on the progress to date.            These plans are the foundation for a brighter future for our territory. The implementation of the Putting People First report will make the Yukon a healthcare leader in Canada, and the Our Clean Future strategy ensures our Yukon’s transition to a green economy creates opportunities across the territory as we move towards a more clean and sustainable future. The committees established to oversee implementation will help keep Yukoners informed of the progress on this important work.      Premier Sandy Silver             We’ve all seen too many ground-breaking reports sit on shelves and collect dust. A lot of work has already been done by the folks behind Putting People First and Our Clean Future. It is our job as leaders to listen to what Yukoners have been asking for. I’m hopeful these committees will help turn these recommendations into action that will make life better for Yukoners.      Yukon NDP Leader Kate White            Quick facts       These committees are a commitment of the Confidence and Supply Agreement and are supported by both the Yukon Liberal government and the Yukon NDP Caucus.

It acknowledges that we have successfully increased access to mental health and substance use services through the hub model while recognizing that the hubs had only been operational for two and a half years at the time of the audit. “The report includes four recommendations to address community consultation and engagement around services; create a robust recruitment and retention strategy for rural staffing; develop and implement a plan for working with First Nations to increase cultural safety in service delivery; and establish, measure and report on the performance of mental health services in rural Yukon. “We acknowledge more work is needed to improve mental health services throughout the Yukon. The recommendations from the OAG will help us achieve our goal to improve mental health and substance use services in all Yukon communities. “Work has already begun to address the four recommendations and we have already identified areas for improvement. Our four mental wellness and substance use hubs have established a strong foundation for expanded services for rural Yukoners and we look forward to building on that foundation to improve mental health across the territory.”     Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7472 matthew.cameron@yukon.ca     News release #:   21-167        "

The Canadian parties have long been concerned about proposed development in the Refuge due to the potential of irreversible impacts of drilling on the Porcupine caribou herd and their sensitive birthing ground habitat, and implication for Indigenous communities who rely on this important resource. Together, the parties released the following statement: “It is vital we continue to take action to conserve and restore our natural areas, biodiversity and recover species at risk. Throughout the environmental review process for the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program, we raised significant concerns about the program, and the process that was followed. These concerns remained unaddressed prior to and following the issuance of leases by the US government in the early part of 2021. This announcement from the US Department of the Interior acknowledges the inadequacies in the process. “An adequate environmental review will assess the deficiencies we identified through our submissions and should include appropriate consultation with our parties, who collaboratively manage the herd and its habitat and represent the users of the herd in Canada. This aligns with the commitments made by the United States in the International Porcupine Caribou Agreement to protect the international Porcupine caribou herd, safeguard its calving grounds that are invaluable to northern Indigenous Peoples, and provide an opportunity for meaningful discussions about an acceptable path forward.  “Our position remains that drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not sustainable for long-term health of the Porcupine caribou herd. We remain committed to our goal of permanent protection for the sacred calving grounds for Porcupine caribou in this region of Alaska. “We will continue to work with our partners in Alaska and the United States federal government to require adequate environmental review for activity in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge so that the Porcupine caribou herd and its habitat will remain protected now, and for future generations. “President Biden has followed through on his commitments to assist us in our efforts. For that we commend his leadership and the support of his administration to ensure that due process will be followed, respecting the rights that are held by stakeholders and rights holders in Canada under international law.”      Quick facts       The Canadian parties attended multiple bilateral meetings and submitted comments in opposition of the oil and gas leasing program in the Refuge throughout the initial environmental assessment undertaken by the previous administration.  The current stay of litigation generated by Indigenous and conservation groups (in both Canada and the United States) expires June 11 and the current administration confirmed they will seek additional stays in litigation to support the new process.  Secretarial Order 3401, released on June 1, 2021, directs the US Department of the Interior to initiate a comprehensive environmental analysis to review the potential impacts of the oil and gas leasing program and to address legal deficiencies under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This could result in the current leases being reaffirmed, voided or amended to include additional environmental requirements.

The Government of Yukon and the Chiefs Committee on Education (CCOE) are pleased to announce the finalization of the Yukon First Nation School Board Framework Agreement. The agreement sets out the process for the creation of a First Nation School Board under the Education Act. This is a critical first step for Yukon First Nations and their Citizens to assume greater authority and control of the administration and management of education programs for students in their communities and the eventual operation of local schools. Signatories to the agreement, representing 10 Yukon First Nations and the Government of Yukon, seek to address long-standing concerns about unacceptable education outcomes for First Nations students. They also commit to provide high-quality and culturally-appropriate education systems for these students based on an Indigenous world view.            Our government is committed to working with all Yukon First Nations to improve the education system and education outcomes for all students. We believe this Framework Agreement and the establishment of a Yukon First Nation School Board will ensure Yukon First Nations can meaningfully shape their children’s education. This is another step forward to decolonizing the system and authentically working towards meaningful, collaborative reconciliation.       Minister of Education Jeanie McLean             We are excited to be on the doorstep of creating a Yukon First Nation School Board, which will provide Yukon First Nations with greater control, authority and responsibility over the education of their citizens and support self-determination. This is an example of effective collaboration among Yukon First Nations and the Government of Yukon in supporting First Nations students, and in ensuring all Yukon students benefit from learning about Yukon First Nations ways of knowing, doing and being.      Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Chief and Chair of the Chiefs Committee on Education, Dana Tizya-Tramm            Backgrounder    Forty-eight years ago, Chiefs from 12 Yukon First Nations presented Together Today for our Children Tomorrow to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, stating their intent to reclaim their inherent rights as Indigenous peoples of Yukon with the control of education for First Nations as a pillar. 		  In 2018, the Chiefs Committee on Education (CCOE) was re-established to negotiate a framework agreement for First Nations education. In 2019, the Government of Yukon and the CCOE agreed to explore the creation of a Yukon First Nation School Board under the provisions of the Education Act. This collaboration resulted in the Framework Agreement to establish the Yukon First Nation School Board. This agreement is a first step forward in reclaiming the rightful authority and control over education for Yukon First Nations and all Indigenous students. 		  The 2009 and 2019 Auditor General’s Reports on Education offered an alarming assessment of Government of Yukon’s inability to meet the needs of First Nations learners in the territory. The Government of Yukon just released the final report of an independent review of inclusive and special education and will work with Yukon First Nations and partners in education to make changes together to address the failings of the system. 		  Created by the Chief’s Committee on Education (CCOE), the Yukon First Nation Education Directorate is working to provide multi-tiered solutions to these long-unaddressed gaps and failures.

This is a joint news release with the Government of Canada and the City of Whitehorse. Investing in local infrastructure supports the unique needs of northern communities. The governments of Canada and Yukon are taking decisive action to invest in community infrastructure and stabilize the economy across Canada, while first and foremost ensuring that the health and safety of all Canadians are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Today, Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna, Yukon’s Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn and City of Whitehorse Mayor Dan Curtis, announced $820,000 for safety improvements in school zones across the City of Whitehorse. The City of Whitehorse will be improving pedestrian safety and calming traffic near several elementary schools with a variety of measures. Projects over the next two years will include a new sidewalk, zebra crosswalks, curb extensions, a mini-roundabout, a paved trail and LED pedestrian lights.  The Government of Canada is investing $820,000 in this project through the federal Gas Tax Fund (GTF), a permanent source of federal funding for infrastructure investments.            Safe and accessible school zones contribute to making Canadian communities good places to live, work, raise families and that is why we are investing $820,000 in this project. By making improvements to school zones across the City of Whitehorse, we are creating safer environments for children, teachers and families walking to and from schools and everyone living in these areas.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna            I am pleased to see the City of Whitehorse using its federal Gas Tax Fund for a project to protect children, our most precious resource. Municipalities have many priorities and ensuring pedestrian safety in school zones is a major one. The Government of Yukon is pleased to partner with the federal government in helping Yukon municipalities and First Nations access the Gas Tax Fund. The fund provides reliable funding for projects that improve the health and well-being of all Yukoners and create economic opportunity.      Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn            On behalf of Council I am pleased to see another one of our Capital Budget projects come to fruition thanks to federal Gas Tax funding. This project aligns with the safe and healthy communities vision in the City’s Sustainability Plan, and we’re hopeful that these improvements will enhance safety at all five school locations.      City of Whitehorse Mayor Dan Curtis            Quick facts       For Jack Hulland Elementary School in Porter Creek, a sidewalk will be built on the west side of Fir Street between 14th and 12th Avenues, as well as a paved trail on the east side between 14th and 12th Avenues. Curb extensions at the crosswalk will be built and an adjacent intersection will be installed to calm traffic, reduce crossing distance and improve sightlines.  At Elijah Smith Elementary School in McIntyre subdivision, enhanced zebra markings will be painted on the pavement at the east-west pedestrian crossing at the Hamilton Boulevard and McIntyre Drive roundabout.  On Lewes Boulevard, enhanced zebra markings will be painted on the pavement and pedestrian-activated LED pedestrian signs will be installed.  On the south side of Wann Road, student drop-off at Holy Family Catholic Elementary School will be prevented and pedestrian illumination will be improved at the crosswalk. Curb extensions at the crosswalk will be installed to calm traffic, reduce crossing distance and improve sightlines. As well, a mini-roundabout at Wann Road and Basswood Street will be built to calm traffic and encourage student drop-off on the north side.  Enhanced zebra marks on pavement will be painted on Wann Road at school crosswalks.  At the crosswalk to Takhini Elementary School, enhanced zebra marks on pavement will be painted on Range Road. Curb extensions at the crosswalk will be installed to calm traffic, reduce crossing distance and improve sightlines.  The federal Gas Tax Fund is a long-term indexed source of funding for over 3,600 communities across the country. In recent years, it has supported thousands of projects annually.  The federal Gas Tax Fund has 18 project eligibility categories, including capacity building, sport infrastructure and roads. Communities can use the funds immediately for priority projects, bank them for later use, pool the dollars with other communities for shared infrastructure projects, or use them to finance major infrastructure expenditures.  Over the past five years, the Government of Canada has invested over $850 million through the Investing in Canada Plan in over 250 projects across the Yukon.

Over the coming year, 36 groups will receive a total of $1.1 million in FireSmart funding to remove forest fuels from areas near their communities. The Government of Yukon is investing $850,000 through the FireSmart funding program, and the Government of Canada’s Emergency Management Assistance Program is contributing a further $250,000.            The FireSmart program encourages communities to reduce the risk of a wildfire impacting their neighbourhoods. Firesmart projects are vital to our government’s approach to creating wildfire-resilient communities. With communities leading the way, we can reduce wildfire hazards while respecting local cultural, environmental and socio-economic priorities.       Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       The FireSmart funding program supports forest fuel reduction projects led by local governments and non-profit groups. Launched in 1998, the program has supported Yukon organizations with over $21 million in funding.  FireSmart project funding is allocated to projects that will effectively reduce wildfire hazards in communities. Criteria include location, type of treatment, values at risk, benefits to community members, geographical distribution of funds throughout the territory, and the past performance of the project’s proponent.  As projects are completed, the Government of Yukon re-allocates unused funds to ensure funding is used effectively and efficiently to continue work in high hazard areas each year.  Wildland Fire Management branch’s strategic vision supports FireSmart projects through the creation of Community Wildfire Protection Plans and larger, landscape-level fuel reduction projects such as the Whitehorse South Fuel Break.

This devastating discovery reinforces Canada’s historic and ongoing struggle with systemic racism.  My heart goes out to those Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation families who now wait to confirm the identities of the 215 children who died at the Kamloops Indian Residential School – and with those in the Yukon and across Canada who bear the burden of the residential school experience. While these discoveries are painful, I hope they bring truth to these families and communities. Out of respect, flags on all Yukon government buildings will be flown at half-mast for 215 hours to honour those who suffered trauma and harm along with their families and communities who are mourning. I know many Yukoners are grieving right now and reliving the painful trauma they have experienced. Mental health services are available to Yukoners both in Whitehorse and in rural Yukon communities through Mental Wellness and Substance Use Services. Yukoners can schedule Rapid Access Counselling supports in Whitehorse and all MWSU community hubs by calling 1-867-456-3838. The pain caused by residential schools is an ever present part of our society. We need to acknowledge this shameful aspect of our national identity and strengthen our resolve to advance reconciliation. As Justice Murray Sinclair said in a visit to the Yukon, 'there is no reconciliation without truth.' These atrocities are shocking but we cannot hide from them. We stand in support for the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation and all Indigenous communities as they continue to search for and uncover evidence of the harms committed against them by governments and churches throughout Canada. All Canadians need to work together to address our complicated history and create a brighter future for the next generation. Our government remains committed to working with our First Nations partners to advance reconciliation.”     Contact   Renée Francoeur 	Cabinet Communications 	867-334-9194 renee.francoeur@yukon.ca     News release #:   21-154        "

123,2021-05-26,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/housing-initiatives-fund-supports-eight-new-affordable-housing-projects,Government Website,Housing Initiatives Fund supports eight new affordable housing projects,"           Published 26/05/2021        The fourth intake of the Housing Initiatives Fund (HIF) will support eight more shovel-ready housing projects over the next two years as well as four housing project development concepts. The selected projects will support 102 new affordable housing units for Yukoners in Dawson City, Teslin, Watson Lake, Lake Laberge and Whitehorse. These units will be below median market rent for 20 years. The fourth HIF intake provided additional considerations for projects that prioritized the needs of seniors, tenants earning less than Yukon Housing Corporation’s household income limits, people experiencing homelessness, and youth aged 18 to 25. It also supported work on housing solutions for staffing strategies for all levels of government and the local business sector. This year, project proponents received an increased amount of funding based on feedback from applicants and to account for increased construction costs due to COVID-19. Shovel-ready projects in Whitehorse received $60,000 per unit up to $600,000 per project. Shovel-ready projects in rural Yukon received $90,000 per unit up to $900,000 per project. Project concepts received up to $20,000. To date, the fund has committed just under $16 million to affordable housing partnership projects for the construction of more than 389 affordable housing units across the territory. Completed projects include an 18-unit building in Whitehorse built by Ramza Development Ltd., two four-unit projects in Carmacks built by the Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation, and a 10-unit project in Haines Junction built by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. A total of 65 units have been completed so far in Whitehorse, Haines Junction, Carmacks and Dawson City and several other projects are underway or near completion. The Housing Initiatives Fund supports a wide range of new affordable housing projects that align with the three pillars of the Housing Action Plan for Yukon: housing with support services, affordable rental housing and increased home ownership options. The next call for housing projects will be in November 2021.            The Housing Initiatives Fund addresses the need for affordable housing in the territory. We are pleased with the tremendous response we have received in each phase. The increased flexibility of the fund allows us to focus on the needs of youth, seniors, low-income and vulnerable Yukoners, as well as staffing pressures for local businesses and all levels of government in both Whitehorse and rural communities. This government is committed to providing affordable housing options to all Yukoners.       Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       Funded projects must include a minimum of four units in Whitehorse or a minimum of one unit in communities. Projects must remain affordable for 20 years.  Projects approved must increase the amount of affordable housing available for Yukoners and can include new affordable rentals, new rent-to-own options, new home ownership options or other mixed market approaches.  This funding can be used with other Yukon Housing Corporation programs such as the Municipal Matching Rental Construction Program, the Developer Build Loan Program and federal, First Nation and municipal funding initiatives.  Existing commitments from the first four intakes will bring online 474 total housing units, including 389 affordable housing units, built by First Nations governments, First Nations Development Corporations, developers, contractors, community organizations and individuals.

Fully vaccinated people will no longer need to self-isolate upon entry to the territory as of May 25. These individuals will need to sign a declaration that they have been fully vaccinated and will also need to provide consent for the verification of their vaccination status in order to be exempt from self-isolation requirements. If an individual does not want to consent to providing that information, they can still enter the territory as long as they self-isolate for 14 days. Additional changes as of May 25 include:  bars and restaurants will be able to return to full capacity for table service; social bubbles can increase to 20 individuals; social gathering sizes can increase with physical distancing: 		 indoor gatherings up to 20 individuals with mask use; outdoor gatherings up to 100 individuals;   organized indoor and outdoor gatherings and events can increase to 200 individuals with physical distancing provided the venue or space can accommodate; funerals, weddings and faith-based services can increase to 200 individuals with physical distancing provided the venue or space can accommodate; gyms and recreation centres can increase to 200 individuals with physical distancing provided the venue or space can accommodate; and camps and recreational programs can increase to 20 individuals indoors with physical distancing and mask use and 100 individuals outdoors with physical distancing.  These changes are based on recommendations from Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley and are guided by A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions. Yukoners are still required to follow the Safe 6 plus 1, which means wearing a mask in indoor public places. To book a vaccine appointment or find more information, visit https://yukon.ca/en/this-is-our-shot.            The territory’s vaccine uptake to date has been great to see. It means that we can safely start lifting restrictions as part of our Path Forward Plan. We are in a fortunate position because of the diligence of Yukoners and we need to keep it up.  We are leading the country when it comes to vaccinations and that work continues. With our youth vaccine rollout starting next month, we look forward to seeing our immunization rates continue to increase. The more people get immunized, the safer our territory will be.      Premier Sandy Silver             We have shown great progress with our vaccination campaign since we began administering vaccines in January. Yukon is in a good place right now and our risk levels are much lower than just a few weeks ago. I believe that based on our current risk levels, we can support the easing of some public health measures while ensuring the well-being and safety of Yukoners remains top of mind.      Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley             Quick facts       14-day self-isolation is still mandatory for travellers who are not fully-vaccinated. Household hosts of these travellers must also self-isolate unless the hosts are fully vaccinated. More details are available on Yukon.ca.

ROHL Global Networks, in partnership with Dagoo Services, has been awarded a $67 million dollar contract for the construction of the Dempster Fibre Line. From this, more than 20 per cent of the contract value will be subcontracted to First Nations businesses. The project’s design has benefitted from extensive First Nation and community consultations. As a result of these discussions, project operations will ensure: protection of heritage, social and cultural resources; and 	minimization of environmental impacts with special consideration for the protection of permafrost, wetlands, caribou and nesting birds. This line will connect to the existing Mackenzie Valley Fibre Link. Together, these lines will result in improved internet and communications performance as well as enhanced opportunities for economic development and diversification. By early 2021, the project completed the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment process and the Government of Yukon received a land use permit from the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board. Site preparation began in 2020.  Construction of the fibre line will begin this summer in Dawson City and is scheduled to be complete in 2024.            This is an important milestone for the Dempster Fibre project. Investing in more reliable telecommunications and internet service for Yukon communities will help Yukoners participate fully in the digital economy. Moreover, it will bring real economic benefits to northern communities as well as employment opportunities.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Nils Clarke            Quick facts       This project is funded by the Government of Canada through its Connect to Innovate Program and Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program, as well as investments from the Government of Yukon and Northwestel.  Dagoo Services is a strategic joint venture comprising Gwitchin and First Nations business people and a local Yukon contractor, Put Put Contracting.  The project will result in direct employment hours for First Nation citizens as well as subcontracting opportunities for First Nation businesses.  The Government of Yukon, in partnership with Aurora College, offered certification courses in environmental and wildlife monitoring in both Dawson City and Inuvik. Participants who received certification will have employment opportunities during construction of the line.  Environmental and wildlife monitors will serve a critical role in the successful implementation of the project through this important and sensitive ecosystem.

Beginning May 31, youth will be able to receive their first doses in Yukon communities. In Whitehorse, first shots will be administered starting June 1. Second dose clinics will start as early as June 23. Everyone who is eligible is encouraged to get their shot for a safe and enjoyable summer. Clinics in communities will be held in schools. In Whitehorse, clinics will be held at the Coast High Country Inn Convention Centre. Due to the limited supply and stricter handling requirements, the Pfizer vaccine will only be available to Yukon youth for a short time, and clinic dates will be more limited than the adult vaccine clinics. Youth vaccine clinics for first and second doses will be held in nearly every Yukon community. Medical travel will be supported in the communities where a clinic is not held, or for youth who are unable to make the clinic date in their community.            We are excited to offer the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for our youth. Giving youth age 12 to 17 the opportunity to be vaccinated will help protect them, their loved ones and the broader community from this virus.      Minister of Health and Social Services Tracy-Anne McPhee            Health Canada approved the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children age 12 and over on May 5, 2021. Clinical trial results of the Pfizer vaccine showed excellent protection against COVID-19 with a strong safety profile. As we have seen in other jurisdictions, youth are not immune to the effects of COVID-19. I encourage all youth to take this unique opportunity to get vaccinated.      Yukon's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       The dates for the youth COVID-19 clinics are listed below. Clinic times will be available shortly.

They must also wait one month after their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine before receiving any other immunization.  Like Moderna, Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is an mRNA vaccine.  Pfizer was initially authorized for ages 16 and up, and received additional authorization for ages 12 to 15 on May 5, 2021.

Kwanlin Dün First Nation (KDFN) and the Government of Yukon are working together for the first time on a joint project to create a master plan for a residential development in Whitehorse’s Range Point neighbourhood. The master plan centres on two parcels of land; Government of Yukon’s Lot 262-6 and KDFN’s Settlement Land parcel C-15B. The plan will identify roads, location and types of housing, water and sewer infrastructure, parks and common areas, trails and potential locations for commercial and other non-residential uses. KDFN Citizens and residents in the Range Point area will be asked to provide their feedback and ideas over the coming months, beginning with a survey from May 14 to 30, 2021. They will be asked for their general development ideas, priorities and concerns. From the feedback received, three draft neighbourhood concepts will be developed and presented for further input in the summer. Then, the planning team will work towards a final concept in fall 2021 that will later be presented to the leadership of the Kwanlin Dün First Nation, Government of Yukon and City of Whitehorse for direction. A final decision on whether to or not to pursue joint land development will be made by the Kwanlin Dün First Nation and the Government of Yukon.                    We are very pleased to partner with the Kwanlin Dün First Nation on the Range Point subdivision planning project. Hearing what is important to their Citizens and residents in the area will help ensure any future development meets their needs. We recognize the much-needed housing opportunities such a project will provide and look forward to collaboratively creating this master plan.      Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn            Range Point could be the Yukon’s first major residential development on Yukon First Nation Settlement Land. Through this potential development, Kwanlin Dün First Nation is taking another step forward in activating the rights in our Final and Self-Government agreements, and in our recently enacted Lands Act. Kwanlin Dün Citizens have identified this parcel of Settlement Land as a site for future development. We are moving forward into the next phase of planning with our partner, the Government of Yukon, to ensure that the development is right for Citizens and residents in the area. We look forward to engaging in the planning process and listening to what people have to say.      Kwanlin Dün First Nation Chief Doris Bill            On behalf of City Council, I am excited to see the Government of Yukon and the Kwanlin Dün First Nation partner to develop two parcels of land in the Range Point neighborhood. When City Administration worked on the Range Road North Neighborhood Plan in 2013-14, one priority was to connect this area to the rest of city, and give it its own neighborhood identity. I believe this represents a wonderful opportunity for Kwanlin Dün First Nation to achieve both, and to turn these parcels into a beautiful neighborhood we can all be proud of.       City of Whitehorse Mayor Dan Curtis            Quick facts       Kwanlin Dün First Nation (KDFN) has owned C-15B since they signed their Final and Self-Government agreements in 2005. Since then, KDFN has exercised the rights in the Final and Self-Government agreements to create the policies and legislation needed to undertake land development.  KDFN completed its Community Lands Plan in 2019. This confirmed Citizens’ direction to explore the development of C-15B, specifically through residential leases.  The City of Whitehorse started the conversation about development of Lot 262-6/C-15B when its council-adopted 2014 Range Road North Neighbourhood Plan.    KDFN registered a parcel of Settlement Land in the Yukon Land Titles Office, receiving the first Certificate of Title for Category A Settlement Land in Yukon. This made it possible for individuals or businesses to purchase a leasehold interest on Settlement Land and register it in the Yukon Land Titles Office.  On October 15, 2020, KDFN brought into force its new, modern Lands Act, Nan kay sháwthän Däk’anúta ch’e, We all look after our land. The Act empowers the First Nation to make Settlement Land available to meet the residential and other lands needs of Beneficiaries and Citizens.

131,2021-05-17,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/be-bear-aware-when-out-land,Government Website,Be bear aware when out on the land,"           Published 17/05/2021        Conservation officers are reminding the public bears are awake and active. Whether people are outside hiking, biking, running, canoeing, camping, gardening or staying at a cabin, now is a good time to brush up on bear awareness skills. Yukoners should know how to spot bear presence and what to do if they encounter a bear and always carry bear spray. In another COVID-19 summer, the Government of Yukon expects to see more Yukoners staying around the territory and enjoying time on the land. To help people prepare, the government will be holding a virtual bear awareness course on Zoom. The focus of the course will be on being bear aware and how to use bear spray. It will take place on May 20 at 6 p.m. Registration is required as only 300 log-ins can be accommodated. Register by emailing coservices@yukon.ca. The Government of Yukon reminds Yukoners of the following:  everywhere in the Yukon is bear country and bears can show up at any time – in the wilderness, camping areas, or residential areas; keep bear spray accessible and know how to use it; always be alert when outside, travel in groups while adhering to physical distancing recommendations, keep children nearby, pets on leash, make noise and carry bear spray; watch for fresh bear signs including tracks, droppings, scratches on trees, and diggings. Leave the area if signs are fresh; deter bears from your property or campsite by managing and storing attractants like food and garbage in bear safe ways. Anything with a scent can attract a bear; do a bear attractant audit of your property and reduce, remove and secure attractants such as recycling, garbage, livestock, chickens, gardens, bird feeders, pet food and compost. Bears’ sense of smell is a lot better than humans – they can detect attractants from very far away; and if you see a bear, stop and remain calm. Get ready to use your bear spray. Determine if the bear is aware of you and respond accordingly.             Living in the Yukon means living in bear country. We have the honour of sharing our space with a large, healthy and active bear population. This also means we have the responsibility to reduce potential human-wildlife conflict. It is important – for our safety and the safety of wildlife – to always be aware of the possible presence of bears when out enjoying the land, to do our part to properly manage attractants, and to give wildlife space when we encounter them.      Minister of Environment Nils Clarke             Quick facts       Managing attractants, at home or while camping, will reduce human-wildlife conflict. Keep attractants in secure containers, vehicles, hard-sided trailers, bear-proof canisters, locked buildings or behind electric fencing.  Yukoners can also learn about bear safety, how to minimize bear attractants and what to do when you encounter a bear at Yukon.ca/bears and on the Conservation Officer Services Branch Facebook page (@yukoncoservices).  Call the TIPP line at 1-800-661-0525 to report aggressive encounters with wildlife or a bear in a residential area.

132,2021-05-14,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/residential-rent-increases-yukon-be-indexed-inflation,Government Website,Residential rent increases in Yukon to be indexed to inflation ,"           Published 14/05/2021        Effective May 15, the Government of Yukon is temporarily indexing residential rent increases in the territory to inflation. Indexing Yukon’s residential rent to inflation is a key policy initiative agreed to under the Confidence and Supply Agreement, which runs until January 31, 2023. From May 15, 2021, through May 14, 2022, landlords may only increase residential rents by 1 per cent, which is the Consumer Prince Index for Whitehorse for 2020. If a landlord gave notice of a rental increase that takes effect after May 15, 2021, they may still increase their rent but the rental increase is limited to 1 per cent. If the landlord chooses to proceed with a rent increase after May 15, the landlord will have to give their tenant a separate notice of the 1 per cent rental increase. The government will review the rent increase percentage each year after the Consumer Price Index is published. Indexing residential rent increases to inflation is one initiative to support the housing needs of Yukoners. The Government of Yukon continues to take a multi-faceted approach to increasing housing options for Yukoners throughout the territory. These include launching the Canada-Yukon Housing Benefit, which provides financial support directly to renters in need, as well as initiatives designed to make more housing available in the territory, such as the development of new residential lots.            Stable affordable housing contributes to the health and wellbeing of all Yukoners and it remains a priority for our government. This temporary residential rent index is one of many approaches to address the need for affordable housing in our territory. Over the next two years, our government will continue to work with both tenants and landlords to evaluate this initiative and look at further options to ensure Yukoners have access to housing they can afford.      Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn            Our economy isn’t working when people can’t afford their home. Tenants need protection now against hundreds of dollars in rent increase. This brings predictability to landlords and tenants and provides relief for tenants until more affordable rental units can be built.      Yukon NDP Leader Kate White             Quick facts       Indexing residential rental increases to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the result of a regulatory change under the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.  The Consumer Price Index is calculated on an annual basis by the Yukon Bureau of Statistics. The CPI for 2020 was 1 per cent.  To increase the supply of housing in the territory, in the last four years the Government of Yukon has:  released 500 lots for development across Yukon; supported development of more than 600 homes since 2018; provided more than $23 million towards home ownership programs; and launched the Canada-Yukon Housing Benefit to help make rental market more affordable for Yukoners.   Moving forward, the Government of Yukon has also identified a number of housing initiatives, including:  develop and release 1,000 new lots in the next five years across the Yukon; work with the private sector on developing the Fifth and Rogers parcel in Whitehorse to increase the amount of available housing; support the establishment of the Yukon Community Land Trust, which will create a permanently affordable housing through a rent-to-own model; and continue to develop incentives for the construction of affordable housing.   The Confidence and Supply Agreement (CASA) was signed on April 28, 2021. The agreement is between the Liberals and the NDP and lays out 16 policy initiatives that the parties will work towards. The agreement is in effect until January 31, 2023.

The revised budget for 2021–22 is $1.79 billion. Operating and maintenance expenses will be $1.36 billion. Capital spending is $434 million. In addition to prior commitments, the revised 2021–22 Budget includes a $1 million initial investment to further address public health impacts of opioids and other drugs for those living with addiction. It also includes $500,000 to start developing a plan to provide dental benefits to uninsured Yukoners as identified in the Putting People First final report. These are campaign commitments and were also agreed to in the Confidence and Supply Agreement (CASA) with the Yukon NDP. The revised Budget also includes $6.4 million in Territorial Health Investment Fund transfers and $5.5 million in COVID-19 supports from Canada, which were both identified since the tabling of the Budget in March. Combined, these funding arrangements are helping reduce the annual deficit and net debt position for 2021–22 since the Budget was tabled in March. Also tabled today were revised Second Supplementary Estimates for the 2020–21 fiscal year. This includes $330,000 for the territorial election and pension plan expenses, which did not appear in the Second Supplementary Estimates tabled in March 2021. A revised Fiscal Outlook outlining the government’s revised fiscal position was also released along with a summary of revisions between the March Budget and the revised Budget tabled today.

This federal budget will support our efforts to combat climate change, provide affordable childcare to Yukon families, and give certainty to Yukon businesses who continue to face difficult challenges from COVID-19. Climate change threatens the safety and resilience of northern infrastructure, ecosystems, and traditional ways of life. To help Yukon adapt to the impacts of climate change, Budget 2021 proposes to provide $25 million in 2021–22 to the Government of Yukon to support its climate change priorities. Budget 2021 also identifies more than $40 million dollars over three years for feasibility and planning of hydroelectric and grid connection projects that will provide clean energy for Canada’s North, including the Atlin Hydro Expansion Project. Up to $27.2 billion over five years, starting in 2021–22 will make the federal government an equal partner in the share of childcare costs with provincial and territorial governments. This builds on our commitment to provide Yukon families with safe, supportive and affordable childcare options. I am pleased to see that this budget recognizes the impacts of COVID-19 on Canada’s businesses including the tourism sector. Support packages worth $1 billion over three years will help Yukon businesses survive the pandemic and plan for even stronger recovery. Yukon’s economy continues to grow despite COVID-19. Budget 2021 gives us the certainty we need to plan for recovery and we will continue to look for ways to ensure Yukoners and Yukon businesses are supported.”     Contact   Renee Francoeur 	Cabinet Communications 	867-334-9194 renee.francoeur@yukon.ca     News release #:   21-110        "

Doug began his career as a public servant in 1946, at the age of 20, the same year he and Pearl married. The job eventually brought him to Whitehorse where, in 1976, he was elected to City Council. After becoming Yukon’s 34th Commissioner in 1980, he was charged with establishing ‘responsible government’ in the Yukon. It was a major legislative and administrative task that would forever alter governance in the territory. After retirement, Doug invested his energies in volunteer work. He chaired various committees, including Yukon’s Emergency Measures Organization, the Federal Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee (FICC), the Northern Resources Conference and the Hootalinqua Land Use Study. A former member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, Doug was also active in the Legion.  Doug was a man who always enjoyed writing. He ran his own writing, photography and public speaking business out of his home. Upon becoming publisher of the Yukon News in 1986, he wrote a weekly column, Rambling, which offered humorous and light-hearted insights into daily life. Doug was recognized in 1989 when he was appointed to the Order of Canada. In 2020, he was awarded the Order of Yukon. Doug will be remembered fondly by family and the many friends he made throughout his long and productive life. His legacy lives on in the work he did but also in the way he approached life.”     Contact   Renée Francoeur 	Cabinet Communications 	867-334-9194 renee.francoeur@yukon.ca     News release #:   21-109        "

Douglas Leslie Dewey Bell was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, on June 15, 1926. In 1942, at the age of 17, Bell joined the Royal Canadian Air Force before he graduated from high school. It was in the Air Force that he developed an interest in radio operation and became a wireless air gunner. He left the Air Force in 1945 and returned to Moose Jaw where he worked at a dairy and took vocational training, graduating as a Radio Operator. In 1946, Bell began his career with the Ministry of Transportation that saw him work in different parts of the country. In 1968, he was appointed Telecommunications Area Manager in Whitehorse, a position he held until 1977. In 1976, he successfully ran for a seat on the Whitehorse City Council. In 1977, he was appointed to serve as the Yukon’s Deputy Commissioner under Commissioner Art Pearson. Upon the resignation in 1979 of Commissioner Ione Christensen, Bell took over her duties in the interim capacity of Administrator. In 1980, Bell officially became the Yukon’s 34th Commissioner. He retired from the post in March 1986. He was the federal government’s top official in Yukon during one of the most significant transitions in the territory’s history: the final stages of the changeover to responsible government in Yukon. He also convinced the Governor General at the time, Ed Schreyer, to invite the territorial commissioners to the annual Governor General and Lieutenant Governors annual conferences. After his retirement, Doug chaired many committees such as the Emergency Measures Organization, the Federal Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee (FICC), the Northern Resources Conference and the Hootalinqua Land Use Study. He was also an active member of the Whitehorse Legion, Branch 254 for many years and he enjoyed sharing stories with others. He also operated a home-based business called Triple Image which offered writing, photography and public speaking services. In 1986, he became publisher of the Yukon News. He also wrote a weekly column in the paper. Bell was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1989. In 2020, he received the Order of Yukon and was part of the first group of recipients of this prestigious Yukon award. The Office of the Commissioner of Yukon sends its love and prayers to his family and all his friends.  The flags on Government of Yukon Main Administration Building and Taylor House will be flown at half-mast, from Monday, April 19, to Monday, April 26, to mark the passing of former Commissioner Doug Bell.      Contact   Kerri Scholz 	Private Secretary to the Commissioner of Yukon 	867-667-5121 kerri.scholz@yukon.ca     News release #:   21-107    Related information:   Commissioners of Yukon 1948-2018        "

In the coming days I will speak with the Leader of the New Democrats and the Leader of the Yukon Party to discuss ways we can work together. The objective of those discussions is to find a way forward that will ensure confidence and supply is achieved in the Assembly. The results of the election in Vuntut Gwitchin will be known one way or the other later today. While that will have some bearing on my next steps, it will not alter the fact that we are in a minority situation regardless of the result.

In 1956, Prince Philip launched the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award in the United Kingdom in order to encourage and support the personal development of young people. The Award in Canada was officially launched in 1963 for Canadians age 14 to 25. An estimated 500,000 young Canadians have participated in the program since 1963, making a difference in their own lives, local communities and around the world. The late Duke of Edinburgh served as a patron or president of close to 800 organizations, 40 of which are in Canada. These reflected his interest in science and technology, sports, youth, conservation and the environment. In 2013, the late Duke was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada and Commander of the Order of Military Merit in recognition of his keen interest in the personal development of young people. From the Queen’s Accession to the throne in 1952 to his official retirement from public engagements in 2017, the late Duke was a constant presence and support for the Queen.

Collins, Vanier Catholic and Porter Creek secondary schools will be able to return to full-time, in-person classes on April 19, 2021. Two planning days have been scheduled to support school staff in adjusting their course plans for the remainder of the school year. Grades 10 to 12 students will not attend in-class school during these two days and will be expected to be learning from home on work assigned by their teachers. Planning days are scheduled for:  Thursday, April 15, 2021; and Friday, April 16, 2021.   To support a safe transition, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health has provided updated health and safety guidelines to allow for relaxing the two metre physical distancing rule at these three schools, while emphasizing:  keeping cohorts/groups of students together and avoiding mixing with other groups as much as possible throughout the school day; minimizing prolonged face-to-face interactions; avoiding physical contact and maximizing physical distancing as much as possible; limiting congregation of students and staff during transitions between classes and in common areas;  non-medical mask use in common areas.  Department of Education central administration staff are working with school principals and school councils at the three high schools to determine how school operations should be adjusted to reflect these guidelines. Once finalized, updated operational plans will be available on each school’s website. Any changes to school operations and programming will be shared with students, families, school councils and school staff ahead of April 19, 2021.            Although school children and teachers have adapted and made the most out of a difficult year, we know students do better overall in a face-to-face learning environment. I feel confident that with our current processes and ongoing immunization we can have our kids return to full-time class safely. As always, we will continue to monitor COVID-19 activity within the territory, and should we face a surge of COVID-19 cases we will have contingencies in place to ensure continued learning.       Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            While we have seen some students succeed on the half-day, in-class schedule, we continue to hear from parents/guardians who are worried about the impact this schedule is having on their child’s learning. Returning students to full-time in-person classes for the remainder of the school year provides students with greater access to teacher support and a chance to get back to their normal school routines before next school year. It also supports our graduating students to finish their Grade 12 year with their friends and teachers as they would in a regular school year.        Deputy Minister of Education Nicole Morgan            Quick facts       Whitehorse Grades 10 to 12 students at F.H.

Today, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages (Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency) and Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna, along with Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn, confirmed funding for the Yukon Resource Gateway Program. The over $359 million contribution agreement will allow the Government of Yukon to restore and renew existing infrastructure, as well as develop new infrastructure where needed in the Dawson and Nahanni ranges. This work includes upgrades to more than 650 kilometres of road and infrastructure throughout the region. These improvements will help bring greater opportunities to Yukon’s communities and support ongoing economic growth throughout the territory. The contribution follows the successful completion of six project agreements to date with Yukon First Nations for components under the Yukon Resource Gateway Program. Each of the project agreements identifies training, employment and business opportunities for First Nations citizens and businesses to ensure communities benefit from these infrastructure upgrades.            Today’s announcement is very exciting for the people of the Yukon. Investments in transportation infrastructure across the territory is vital to ensuring long-term economic development and growth.

184,2021-03-12,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/new-health-care-policy-supports-transgender-community,Government Website,New health care policy supports transgender community,"           Published 12/03/2021        The Yukon government has announced changes to significantly improve access to gender-affirming health care, including surgery for Yukoners. A new policy through Yukon’s Insured Health and Hearing Services has expanded health care insurance coverage to include a comprehensive list of surgeries and other procedures identified by the transgender and gender diverse community, and that align with the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s internationally recognized standards of care that support individuals for gender transition. In addition, the Yukon government is also providing enhanced access to hormone therapy. Development of this new policy supports the Yukon government’s larger action plan to improve LGBTQ2S+ inclusion in programs and services within government. The policy supports our vision of continuing to improve health and wellness outcomes for all Yukoners. These changes are consistent with the recommendations of the Putting People First report to enhance health equity and provide more people-centred, holistic care.            Over the past four years, our government has made many changes to legislation, policies and practices to support a diverse, inclusive society that promotes LGBTQ2S+ rights, equality and freedom from discrimination. The lack of access to gender-affirming health services, including surgery, represented a significant unmet healthcare need within the transgender community, often preventing transgender individuals from leading happy and healthy lives in our territory. We are pleased to provide public health care coverage of these important procedures, as part of our people-centred approach to wellness that helps Yukoners thrive.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Through our extensive engagement with Yukon’s LGBTQ2S+ community we have heard that transgender health care is a top priority. This new policy addresses the broad array of gender-affirming health care needs in a progressive, dignified and inclusive way and will make a positive, transformative difference in the lives of Yukoners who need these services.      Minister responsible for Women’s Directorate Jeanie McLean             Quick facts       The policies were developed in consultation with Dr. Michael Marshall, a psychiatrist with a specialized focus on the health and wellness of the gender diverse population. Dr. Marshall is the president of the Canadian Professional Association for Transgender Health.  The policy was also reviewed by Dr. Gail Knudson, past president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). Both Dr. Knudson and Dr. Marshall facilitated the WPATH training in Whitehorse in 2019 that was delivered to over 100 health professionals working in the territory, the first time in Canada such training was offered at no cost to participants.  Many transgender people will seek medical assistance to bring their physical appearance in line with their gender identity.  This could include hormone therapy and/or surgery. The new policy notes the provision of hormones and other gender-affirming procedures are not cosmetic and are life-saving for transgender people.   Transition-related surgery, also known as TRS, refers to a range of surgical options people may require for gender transition. This is also known as sex-reassignment surgery (SRS), gender-confirming surgery (GCS), or gender-affirming surgery (GAS).  Delaying or denying access to transition-related health care can cause significant harm, and research has demonstrated that completing a transition for those who need it can considerably increase a person’s wellbeing. The new policy commits government to review and update it upon a new release of WPATH’s Standards of Care.

It is thanks to your vigilance and care for one another that we have limited the spread of the virus here in the territory. The last 12 months have seen unprecedented collaboration and cooperation across the country. Leaders have recognized the unique circumstances and vulnerabilities of the territories and provided support for northerners throughout the pandemic response, from personal protective equipment to vaccine allocations and economic aid. I am especially proud of the coordination across all levels of government as we navigate the largest immunization campaign in Canada’s history. Yukon is in a fortunate position to be able to provide vaccines to every eligible adult that wants one. Every day more Yukoners are stepping up and taking their shot to keep our territory healthy and safe. Our goal is to vaccinate as many Yukoners as possible so we can lift COVID-19 restrictions and continue on our path forward. On behalf of all Yukoners, I would like to offer deep gratitude to all our healthcare professionals and essential front-line workers. Throughout a time of great uncertainty, the tireless efforts of these heroes have ensured that we have reliable access to services, dependable supply chains, and support for our loved ones.

The additional orthopedic surgeon will help reduce wait times for elective surgeries and increase the number of surgeries conducted in the territory for patients who would otherwise have to travel out of territory for surgery.  The new surgeon is expected to begin in April 2021. Currently all hip replacements are done out of territory. The addition of a third surgeon will help reduce the wait time for in-territory knee replacements and allow for in-territory hip surgeries to begin.            Putting People First means offering more services closer to home. We believe that a third surgeon is necessary if we are to continue meeting the needs of Yukon’s growing population. The addition of a third surgeon means that not only can we increase the number of knee replacements being done in Yukon but we can also begin to offer hip replacements. It is very exciting to be able to offer these increased services to Yukoners.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost             Whenever possible, Yukon Hospitals seeks to expand the scope and availability of services for Yukoners. More orthopedic services and expertise means Yukoners benefit from improved access to care, fewer delays, less travel, and the ability to recover right here at home.      Chair of Yukon Hospital Corporation Brian Gillen             We look forward to welcoming a third orthopedic surgeon to Whitehorse General Hospital this year. Our newest colleague will bring further expertise to the Yukon, joining the team as we prepare to launch our local hip replacement program.

The economic resilience plan is a strategic response that looks at current planned projects and programs with an eye to maximizing benefits while outlining new initiatives to support Yukoners as we adapt and build economic resilience. The plan charts the government’s economic response to the pandemic and how we are adapting to build economic resilience. It identifies five key areas of focus: people, jobs, business supports, infrastructure development and economic diversification. The plan reflects input from the Council of Yukon First Nations Chief’s Committee on Economic Development and incorporates recommendations form the Business Advisory Council and the Yukon Tourism Advisory Board. Yukon led the country in developing vital economic programs and supports in response to the unprecedented impacts of COVID-19. The economic resilience plan reflects a commitment to adapt programs to meet the needs of the businesses and sectors so they can contribute to a thriving, prosperous and diversified Yukon economy.            Throughout the pandemic, our government’s economic and social supports have protected local businesses and bolstered vital sectors of our economy. We continue to adapt programs to meet the changing needs of Yukon businesses. The economic resilience plan reflects our commitment to continue supporting local businesses to ensure Yukon is well positioned to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever.

The SCAN Act enables the SCAN Unit to investigate complaints received from the public and take action when illegal or dangerous activity is occurring on a property that negatively affects the neighbourhood. Each activity the SCAN Unit can investigate is identified in the Act as a ""specified use"", which currently includes illegal drug and alcohol activities and prostitution. The proposed amendments will expand the definition of ""specified use"" to include illegal activities related to child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation, gangs and criminal organizations, and illegal firearms.            Yukoners want safe, healthy communities where the increase of criminal activity can be addressed to make neighbourhoods safe. The proposed amendment will expand the types of activities the SCAN Unit can investigate to increase public safety in Yukon communities. This unit plays an important role in building safer communities by receiving complaints and responding to the concerns of Yukoners.      Minister of Justice Tracy-Anne McPhee            Quick facts       The SCAN Unit is complaint-driven and only begins an investigation after receiving a complaint.  The SCAN unit has protocols in place with nine Yukon First Nations governments.  Statistics Canada reports that there were a total of 114 reported sexual violations against children between 2015 and 2019 in Yukon; 26 in 2015, 21 in 2016, 16 in 2017, 25 in 2018 and 26 in 2019.  The Commissioner of Firearms for the RCMP’s Canadian Firearms Program reports that the number of firearms seized in Yukon between 2015 and 2018 is 71; 18 in 2015, 16 in 2016, 20 in 2017 and 17 in 2018.

The proposed amendment will allow greater access to spousal support for former common law spouses by removing the time limit for support applications. Currently, the Act states that an application for spousal support by a common law spouse must be made within three months of the date of separation. This short time limit places recently separated common law spouses in a compromising position because they must either apply for support before their relationship has clearly and permanently ended, or allow their claim to lapse before it is clear that reconciliation is no longer possible. There is no time limit for married spouses to apply for spousal support. Bill No. 19 reflects best practices of similar legislation across Canada.            This proposed amendment would promote fairness and provide equal access to spousal support for common-law and married spouses. This is yet another part of our ongoing efforts to modernize laws by making them more inclusive of modern Yukon families and reflective of best practices.      Minister of Justice Tracy McPhee            Quick facts       Spousal support refers to money that one spouse is legally obligated to pay to the other spouse after a relationship has ended.  The proposed amendment would only apply to common law relationships that end after the new Act has come into force.  Married spouses would not be affected as there is no time limit for married spouses to apply for spousal support.

The new Economic Development Fund provides greater funding flexibility so clients can undertake a wider range of projects that will increase local spending and employment opportunities throughout the territory. The new program reduces red tape by implementing a standardized application process, and expands the range of eligible expenses, such as capital purchases. All eligible projects will now have equal access to funding regardless of their size, and new multiple intake dates will ensure funds are better allocated. The new program replaces the Regional Economic Development Fund, the Strategic Industries Development Fund and the Enterprise Trade Fund. The amalgamation of funds follows public engagement in 2019 on how to modernize and improve these programs.            This new economic development fund benefits businesses through all stages of planning and will offer local businesses funding flexibility that is more responsive to their needs. This will maximize the impact of our funding investments and support innovation, job creation and private sector growth throughout the Yukon. Our government will continue to foster business innovation and sustainability to support Yukon’s dynamic business community and diversify the territory’s economy.      Minister of Economic Development Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       The department is hosting online information sessions:  March 17 from 7 to 8 p.m.; March 18 from 12 to 1 p.m.; and March 20 from 2 to 3 p.m.   The Economic Development Fund has an annual budget of $1.96 million.  Funding is divided into three tiers with the following application deadlines:  Tier 1 for applications up to $30,000, applications accepted throughout the year. Tier 2 for applications between $30,001 and $100,000, on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15. Tier 3 for applications over $100,000, on January 15 and June 15.   Project applications will also be evaluated according to their potential climate impacts and alignment with Yukon’s goals for climate change adaptation and mitigation as identified in Our Clean Future, the Government of Yukon’s strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy.  The new program was developed following a public engagement process. The department contacted 83 stakeholders and partners to gather feedback and received 210 responses during the survey period.  Projects underway under the existing funds will continue until completion.  Complete applications for any of the three existing programs received before April 1 will be assessed under those existing programs.

Through this agreement, Yukon will receive approximately $3.12 million in targeted federal funding in 2020–21. This funding will help Yukon develop 1Health, a territorial electronic health record, which will integrate a suite of virtual health tools including: secure video-conferencing technology, secure messaging and file transfer, a curated patient portal, remote patient monitoring technologies and infrastructure. The funding will support the 1Health Yukon initiative to enhance Yukoners’ experience in the health care system and improve health care outcomes across the territory. In addition, we will engage with physicians on lessons learned during COVID-19 to collectively create an action plan outlining how the federal funding will be used to improve access to virtual care through investment in 1Health Yukon.            Yukon is the first provincial or territorial jurisdiction to enter into an agreement with the Government of Canada under this funding agreement. We are happy to be implementing this Putting People First recommendation. This investment will support the use of technology to increase access to care, bring it closer to home, and improve its delivery and coordination across Yukon. This is a very positive step forward in our effort to provide more accessible health care to all Yukoners.      Yukon’s Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Now more than ever, Canadians need access to virtual care services to support their health. We are working with provinces and territories to rapidly deploy such services for Canadians, to ensure they can access the care they need, whenever they need them. Today’s investment will support Yukon in their expansion of virtual health care services, ensuring Yukoners have health services throughout the pandemic.      Canada’s Minister of Health Patty Hajdu            Quick facts       1Health Yukon consists of a number of initiatives to support the health care needs of Yukoners today and into the future by using technology to increase access to care, provide opportunities to bring care closer to home, and improve delivery and coordination of care through an integrated health information system that connects health care settings across Yukon.

This includes approximately $15 million for a new Yukon-wide universal child care program. Licensed child care operators who opt into the new universal child care program will receive additional funding from the Government of Yukon, which will benefit families through reduced monthly fees. Starting on April 1, families will save up to $700 per month per child who are registered in participating licensed full-time child care programs. For example, if a family pays $850 per month, they would now pay $150 in fees. Children in part-time programs will receive a pro-rated fee reduction. Operators who choose to participate in the program will also benefit from enhanced funding for operations and wages for Early Childhood Educators.  Existing subsidies such as the Teen Parent grant and the Grandparent grant will continue to be provided.            Introducing universal affordable child care in Yukon will put more disposable income into the hands of families and create more choices for those who want to work outside the home. This will save families up to $700 per month per child, helping to build a stronger economy and support Yukon children to grow into healthy, happy adults.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost             Our government believes that all families should have access to affordable, high-quality child care and early learning opportunities. Early Childhood Educators play a key role in setting up our children for success in school and life and it is important that we recognize and support them. By investing in families and education, we are creating healthy, thriving communities.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee             Quick facts       In July 2020, Premier Silver announced that Yukon would be moving to a universal, affordable child care system.  In 2018 and 2019 the Government of Yukon undertook extensive engagements with First Nations governments, child care operators, Early Childhood Educators, families and stakeholders in the child care sector to better understand the needs of children and families in their communities.  Utilizing information from past Yukon engagements, a team from Health and Social Services and Education has been working with Yukon First Nations governments and key stakeholders, including child care operators and education partners, over the past few months, to determine how to create a universal childcare model for Yukon based on the principles of affordability, accessibility and quality.  On April 1, the Child Care Unit will move to the Department of Education and become the Early Learning and Child Care Unit to help ensure that early learning and childcare services are coordinated at all levels.

The approach focuses on reducing or modifying COVID-19 restrictions. It is contingent on the territory's overall vaccination rate, the new case count remaining low, the understanding and impact of the COVID-19 variants, and ongoing adherence to public health measures. The strategy includes details on how Yukon will transition to the next phase of the pandemic response and how citizens can begin living sustainably with the virus as part of our everyday lives. A Path Forward: Next Steps replaces A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions, which was released in May 2020. The new approach stresses that in order to reduce the importation and transmission of the virus, we will need to strengthen some measures and ensure greater compliance with existing measures. As spring approaches, this will allow the flexibility to provide some relief from restrictions that affect the daily lives of Yukoners and move us into the next phase of recovery. This may include: reducing constraints on the size of our social bubbles to allow us to connect with family and friends more easily; increasing indoor and outdoor gathering sizes when it is safe to do so, and increasing capacity for food and beverage businesses. Adjustments to public health measures may also include determining how to make events, such as potlatches, weddings, funerals and celebrations of life, safer. The next phases also consider how to adjust self-isolation requirements to support businesses who rely on external clients or employees from outside the territory.            We continue to be focused on protecting our communities and our most vulnerable residents. We are preparing to relax some restrictions for Yukoners when it is safe to do so. The coming weeks will be a balance between keeping some key measures in place while easing others. Restrictions will need to remain in place as we work to immunize as many Yukoners as possible. Measures such as the requirement to self-isolate upon entry to Yukon continue to be our best means of keeping the virus out of our communities.        Premier Sandy Silver            The need to create and maintain the best balance between protecting Yukoners from the spread of COVID-19 and protecting their health and well-being will be our biggest challenge in the coming months. We are facing very different circumstances today than when we released our original Path Forward plan in May.  We will need to maintain some restrictions in order to reduce others. There is no quick or easy resolution to living with COVID-19.      Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       The Path Forward: Next Steps strategy includes details about how and when Yukon will transition to the next phase of the pandemic response. A start date for this next phase is dependent on vaccinating as many adult Yukoners as possible, keeping new cases low and better understanding the impacts of the COVID-19 variants.   Yukon has been able to vaccinate its citizens at a greater per capita rate than most other Canadian jurisdictions. While others are beginning to vaccinate seniors this week, Yukon is many months ahead as we start administering doses to the general population over the age of 18.  There are currently no active cases of COVID-19 in the territory.

210,2021-03-04,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/budget-makes-life-more-affordable-historic-investments-yukon-families-infrastructure-and-renewable-energy,Government Website,"Budget makes life more affordable with historic investments in Yukon families, infrastructure and renewable energy ","           Published 04/03/2021        Today, Premier and Finance Minister Sandy Silver tabled the Government of Yukon’s 2021–22 Budget. The $1.79 billion budget is focused on improving the lives of Yukoners and includes significant investments in education, housing, community infrastructure and renewable energy projects. To support Yukon families and make their lives more affordable, the government will invest more than $25 million towards early learning initiatives. This includes $15 million to support a new universal childcare program for the Yukon that will put more disposable income into the hands of families, saving them on average $700 per month per child. A family with two kids will have an additional $1,400 in their pockets every month starting April 1, 2021. This is another step towards the implementation of the Putting People First report to improve Yukon’s health and social services. More than $1.4 million will make medical travel easier and more affordable for Yukoners. On January 1, the medical travel subsidy was doubled to $150 per day for multi-day travel. More than $50 million will support initiatives in Our Clean Future, Yukon’s strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy. This includes $16 million for community-based renewable energy projects across the territory, and $6.1 million for energy rebates to help Yukon families and businesses adopt renewable sources of heating and make their homes and buildings more energy efficient. Over $1 million in clean transportation rebates will help Yukoners acquire electric vehicles, including ebikes. An additional $500,000 will go towards fast-charging stations to support electric vehicle use throughout the territory. $10 million is also included to advance the Atlin hydro expansion project in partnership with the Taku River Tlingit First Nation to increase renewable energy in the territory. This year’s budget includes record capital expenditures of $434.3 million, 17 per cent higher than 2020-21. From over $30 million for lot development to $12 million for affordable housing projects and more than $70 million towards transportation infrastructure, this capital spending will provide increased opportunities for Yukon businesses to contribute to community infrastructure projects across the territory. Yukon’s small business tax was also cut to zero per cent on January 1, 2021. The change will support an estimated 2000 Yukon businesses and is expected to save this sector approximately $2 million per year. This year’s budget was again tabled together with a Fiscal and Economic Outlook for the territory and a Five-Year Capital Plan. The Outlook shows the territory’s economy is projected to experience strong growth in the coming years. Yukon’s real GDP growth is forecast at 7.9 per cent for 2021, as a result of production from the Eagle Gold mine and the recently restarted operations in the Keno Hill district. Yukon is one of the only jurisdictions in Canada to experience GDP growth in 2020, with growth projected to continue, averaging 4.7 per cent per year out to 2025. The Five-Year Capital Plan outlines how the Government of Yukon will prioritize the interests and needs of Yukoners through the procurement, management and delivery of capital projects. The plan considers northern construction realities, aligning capital needs with the strengths of local businesses in order to maximize the benefit for Yukon communities. The Government of Yukon’s increased transparency around capital planning has improved coordination with First Nations, municipal and private sector partners and helped make the best use of federal funding to meet the needs of Yukoners in all communities.            This budget builds on the strong foundation we have developed over the past four years and continues on the path toward a brighter future for the Yukon. Having returned the territory’s finances to a sustainable path, we are taking significant steps to build a healthier, more vibrant, sustainable and inclusive territory for the benefit of all Yukoners. Our new universal childcare program will make life more affordable for Yukon families while more than $50 million will help address climate change and grow Yukon’s green economy. We have also included a $15 million COVID contingency to ensure we can continue to support Yukoners and Yukon businesses as we navigate the pandemic. With Yukon’s vaccine rollout well underway, we are forging ahead with investments that will ensure a prosperous future for our territory.      Premier and Minister of Finance Sandy Silver            Quick facts       Yukon’s total budget for 2021–22 is $1.79 billion. Operating and maintenance expenses will be $1.35 billion. Capital spending is $434 million, a record amount that is 17 per cent higher than last year.  In addition to planned economic and social supports, $15 million is included as a COVID-19 contingency in recognition of the potential for emerging costs to continue managing the pandemic. The 2021–22 Main Estimates show a deficit of $12.7 million dollars that is entirely the result of economic and social supports as well as health services for Yukoners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  An Interim Supply Bill that will fund operations and maintenance spending for the first two months of the 2021–22 fiscal year while the 2021–22 Main Estimates are debated in the Legislative Assembly was also tabled. Of that amount, $325 million is for operations and maintenance spending and $75 million is for capital expenditures.   A Second Supplementary Estimates for the 2020–21 fiscal year was also tabled, with an additional $33.1 million in spending and an offsetting increase of $37.4 million in recoveries. The Second Supplementary Estimates forecasts a revised deficit of $6.7 million for 2020–21.

As of February 22, 2021, portions of the policy will be used by procurement authorities on Government of Yukon procurements. The Government of Yukon and Yukon First Nations partners will continue to meet with the business community to ensure the implementation of this policy is a success for all Yukoners.

Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            Yukon First Nations and Yukon government continue to work together to build understanding about the policy within the business community as we enter the implementation phase. The Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy is a concrete step that will contribute to a better future for our people, communities and the territory as a whole.       Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston             Quick facts       Implementation timelines of bid value reductions and the verification process will be pushed back until October 4, 2021.  The Monitor and Review Committee is responsible for ensuring the policy is reaching its intended goals and always being improved.

Minister of Environment Pauline Frost sees this announcement setting course in the right direction. She offers the following statement: “I am very pleased to see the environmental commitments from the Prime Minister and President in the joint roadmap. I am encouraged by the awareness of Indigenous rights and leadership in environmental stewardship, the forward-thinking approach to climate change action and the overall collaboration approach on protecting our shared environment.   As I’ve said many times before, animals like salmon and caribou do not stop at our borders. The effects of climate change and our responsibilities to sustainably manage our impacts on the environment cannot be accomplished by nations working in isolation. Environmental stewardship is a global effort and it is imperative that neighbouring jurisdictions work with us. The recognition of the ecological importance of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is perhaps the most exciting element of this announcement. The commitment to work together to help safeguard the Porcupine caribou herd calving grounds that are invaluable to the Gwich’in and Inuvialuit peoples’ culture is encouraging. Together with our other Canadian partners within the Porcupine Caribou Management Agreement, we have been working so hard to see this level of acknowledgement and commitment to Indigenous rights and environmental protection. I am elated to see this progress and am excited to see it come to fruition on the land. I commend the specific mention to the US rejoining the Paris Agreement, which aligns well with Yukon’s actions to address climate change. I am optimistic that this renewed relationship will lead to meaningful steps in the right direction for salmon management and conservation. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the nomination of Debra Haaland to be the first Indigenous Secretary of the Interior. As an Indigenous woman, I understand first-hand the importance of representation in leadership roles and the positive impact it can have for our culture, in our communities, and for the success of future generations.”     Contact   Renee Francoeur 	Cabinet Communications 	867-334-9194 renee.francoeur@yukon.ca     News release #:   21-059    Related information:   Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership        "

Today, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister Responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Ahmed Hussen, along with Minister Responsible for Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost and Larry Bagnell, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages (Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency) and Member of Parliament for Yukon, announced a Government of Canada funding contribution of up to $34.5 million, in addition to approximately $4.5 million from the Government of Yukon for an 84-unit supported housing development for seniors in Whitehorse. This new Normandy Manor development will be built and operated by KBC developments, a local partnership of Ketza Construction, Borud Enterprises and Northern Vision Development. Normandy Manor will help fill a gap in the housing continuum by providing housing for Yukon seniors who cannot live independently, but who are not ready to move into continuing care. When complete, the Yukon Housing Corporation will have access to 10 units in the building as part of their community housing stock. The project is located in the Takhini subdivision of Whitehorse on the Traditional Territory of the Kwanlin Dün First Nation and the Ta'an Kwäch’än Council. Normandy Manor is receiving support through the National Co-Investment Fund, a flagship initiative of the National Housing Strategy (NHS), the Housing Initiatives Fund and the Municipal Matching Rental Construction program.            Canada’s seniors have shaped this country and contribute to our communities every day. Now more than ever, we need to ensure they have access to a safe and affordable place to call home. Normandy Manor is testament to what can be achieved when all levels of government come together with a shared purpose, and I look forward to seeing the positive impact this project will have on the community in Whitehorse.      Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Ahmed Hussen            We are working hard to increase options for Yukoners across the housing continuum and throughout the territory. This new supportive seniors’ housing project aligns with Yukon’s Aging in Place Action Plan and demonstrates what we can achieve through effective partnerships between the private sector and municipal, territorial and federal orders of government.      Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost            Yukon’s seniors deserve a healthy and affordable place to call home. Through the co-investment fund our Government is working hand in hand with the territory and private partnerships to ensure an increased stock of senior specific affordable.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell            On behalf of Council, I am excited to see more supported housing for seniors in our community. We are proud to contribute to this project through a development incentive and we will continue to work with our government and First Nation partners to help people attain housing across the housing continuum. We are happy to see more seniors staying in Whitehorse and projects like these will encourage even more.      City of Whitehorse Mayor Dan Curtis            KBC is proud to have developed the first private-sector, seniors’ supportive housing in the territory that will fill a gap in the housing continuum with a product developed, built and owned by Yukoners. We recognize that this project would not be possible without the support of three levels of government, and we join all Yukoners in thanking Canada, Yukon and the City of Whitehorse for their support. When Normandy Manor opens in 2022, we look forward to turning it from a construction project into a community with supports and programs that enable seniors to live long, healthy lives and age in place.

The City of Whitehorse contributed $500,000 in development incentives over 10 years.  Construction started on the 84-unit Normandy Manor project in August 2020.  This project supports the goals of the Housing Action Plan for Yukon and the Aging in Place Action Plan to help Yukoners find housing that meets their needs.  The National Housing Strategy is an ambitious 10-year, more than $55 billion plan that is giving more Canadians across the country a place to call home, creating 125,000 new housing units and reducing housing need for 530,000 households, as well as repair and renew more than 300,000 housing units.

217,2021-03-02,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukon-societies-and-business-corporations-have-updated-legislation,Government Website,Yukon societies and business corporations have updated legislation  ,"           Published 02/03/2021        Yukon societies, business corporations and cooperative associations now have modern, updated legislation to guide them, effective April 1. The Corporate Statutes Amendment Act, which includes updates to the Business Corporations Act, the Cooperative Associations Act and the new Societies Act, has been proclaimed. With the amendments, the new Societies Act has also been proclaimed and its new regulations have been approved. Societies will have two years to transition to conform to the new Societies Act. The new Societies Act is written in plain language, is more user-friendly and provides significant updates to provide clearer guidance and allow societies more autonomy. Processes regarding the creation, governance and operation of societies are now set out more clearly. For consistency, some related technical amendments were also made to the Business Corporations Act and the Cooperative Associations Act by the Corporate Statutes Amendments Act.  Public education on the changes and required transition will be provided to societies. This will include video tutorials and updated web pages. It will also include a walk-through demonstration to access the Yukon Corporate Online Registry (YCOR) online features. There will be no charge to search the Societies Registry online.             I’d like to thank societies for their patience; it’s great to see regulations in place. Our modern societies legislation will now provide Yukoners with the clearer guidance and responsibility that they have asked for. The updated Yukon Online Corporate Registry will now support societies by streamlining and reducing the volume of paperwork, so that they can spend their time focusing on the quality programs and supports enjoyed by many Yukoners.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       As of February 25, 2021, there were over 635 active societies registered in Yukon. The Corporate Affairs Branch also maintains corporate registries of more than 5,949 business corporations and over 5,685 partnerships and business names.  To transition, currently registered societies will have to file “new” constitutions. Under the new legislation, a society’s constitution can contain only the name and purposes of the society. Each new constitution must contain the same name and purposes as the old constitution. Any information in the old constitution other than the name and purposes of the society cannot be included. Societies must also submit information regarding current directors and the registered offices, along with file new bylaws conforming with new legislative requirements. They may create their own or adopt model bylaws provided on www.yukon.ca for April 1.  To ensure transparency, Class A societies with annual gross incomes over $120,000 or assets over $250,000 are required to retain an accountant to report on their financial statements. However, they may waive this requirement for a maximum of two consecutive years if (and only if) they have a bylaw allowing for such a provision and they adopt a resolution at their AGM to do so for the coming year.  A new class of member-funded societies will be self-funded and not require mandatory reporting.  Financial statements will not be required to be filed with the registry, but must be available for public view at societies’ registered offices.  Societies will be required to include in their financial statements remuneration of employee positions in a society, including contractors, who are paid a yearly amount of $75,000 or more. Actual names will not be required to be reported.   Directors make important financial and legal decisions on behalf of their societies and organizations. As a result, individuals who are legally underage, bankrupt or under guardianship for legal or financial matters may not be directors of a business corporation, cooperative association or a society.  Extra-territorial societies will now be regulated by the Business Corporations Act. To accommodate this change, amendments were made to the Naming Regulation, which supports the Business Corporations Act, the Cooperative Associations Act, the Partnership and Business Names Act and the Societies Act. These changes mean fewer restrictions for extraterritorial societies regarding naming and simplified filing requirements.

The two organizations have formed a new partnership that capitalizes on their mutual and individual areas of expertise. They recently submitted a joint proposal that meets all of the criteria outlined in the Expression of Interest issued by the Government of Yukon in October 2020. The John Howard Society Pacific is a social service organization that operates throughout British Columbia and in Yukon. It has extensive experience delivering innovative and person-centered programs including housing, community-based residential facilities, outreach, and community services. CYFN’s partnership on this project will ensure that the services and support delivered to residents are locally, contextually, and culturally relevant, to better support the residence’s many Indigenous tenants.             We are very pleased that the Council of Yukon First Nations and the John Howard Society are partnering together to assume operations of the Housing First residence.

John Howard Society Pacific CEO Mark Miller            Quick facts       The Government of Yukon has been operating the Housing First residence since February 2020, when the first tenants moved into the building.  Government’s intent has always been for the residence to be operated by a non-governmental organization.  The Housing First residence has 16 units and is currently housing 18 tenants.  The transition to the new operators will have no impact on the residence’s tenants. Service delivery will continue uninterrupted.  Housing First is an approach to ending homelessness that centers on moving people experiencing homelessness into permanent housing.

Safe supply programs have been rolled out in other jurisdictions, and have demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating the effects of a toxic drug supply. The federal government, the Canadian Public Health Association and 95 per cent of our harm reduction community agree: Yukon should explore safer supply.            The recent opioid-related deaths are a tragic reminder that fentanyl continues to present a very real danger in our communities. It is time to rally around our communities, our friends, our neighbours and family members who need our support. We need to be compassionate and supportive, while working together to end the stigma around drug use and addiction.

I knew him as a fellow politician, an avid hockey fan, a loyal citizen of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, and a proud father, and a dear friend. Darius served the riding of Vuntut as a Member of the Legislative Assembly from 2006 to 2016. The people of Old Crow trusted him to advocate for their values and community. This fueled his passion to protect and advocate for the Porcupine Caribou Herd, and his travels to educate the world about this critical habitat. Darius dedicated himself to environmental matters since his youth, when he was Canada’s representative in New York City at the United Nations Summit. Darius studied renewable resources management and eventually became a park warden at Vuntut National Park. He served on countless boards and committees dedicated to the protecting of fish and wildlife before and after politics. Darius was the interim leader of the Liberal Party in 2011, when I was starting out as an MLA. In my first year as MLA for Klondike, no one reached out to mentor or guide me more than Darius. I will always cherish his genuine concern and sound advice. In the Legislative Assembly, Darius was knowledgeable and passionate. When needed, he could be fierce when speaking for his community. Darius was extremely proud of his children and the rest of his family. My heart goes out to them.”     Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136 matthew.cameron@yukon.ca     News release #:   21-048        "

Through a combination of coursework, simulators and hands-on training, students will learn how to safely operate heavy equipment such as rock trucks, loaders and backhoes. In doing so, they will gain the skills needed for meaningful employment in a range of maintenance and construction projects, including upcoming improvements on the Nahanni Range Road and Robert Campbell Highway north of Watson Lake. Under the agreement, Coeur Silvertip Holdings will provide qualified trainers, the equipment on which students will train and accommodation, including meals. This represents a significant in-kind contribution. Yukon University will provide courseware, training materials and instructors to teach Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) and other jobsite training.            This is another of many opportunities the Yukon Resource Gateway Program is creating for Yukoners throughout the territory. Training for Yukoners living in our communities is essential if we want to build our economy. I am happy to be partnering with the Liard First Nation to create more opportunities for its citizens.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            This training initiative is a great first step in preparing our membership for future employment opportunities. These benefits are the product of both cooperation and the willingness of all involved in working together. This is only the beginning of such partnerships; that will result in practical hands-on training.      Liard First Nation Chief Stephen Charlie             Quick facts       Training began last week for eight students. The number had to be limited because of COVID-19 guidelines.  The training is taking place at the Watson Lake campus of Yukon University and Silvertip Mine.  The heavy equipment operator training agreement will provide increased capacity for Liard First Nation to participate in two upcoming projects under the Yukon Resource Gateway Program.  In January 2020, the Government of Yukon and the Liard First Nation reached an agreement under the program for upgrades to the Nahanni Range Road.  In June 2020, the Government of Yukon and the Liard First Nation reached another agreement under the program to upgrade parts of the Robert Campbell Highway.

Today, Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna, and Minister of Community Services for the Government of Yukon John Streicker, announced funding for a new consolidated fire hall and public works building for the Town of Faro. Both governments are taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, as they adapt to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic and support the creation of jobs. Yukoners need municipal infrastructure facilities that are modern, efficient and environmentally responsible. The new Faro Public Works and Fire hall will replace two existing buildings. The design of the new building meets the needs of the town, it includes seven vehicle bays, staff offices, shared meeting rooms, parts and tool storage, a morgue and decontamination areas. The new building is designed to exceed minimum energy standards by 25 per cent. The mechanical design utilizes in-floor radiant heating, and air curtains on several of the overhead doors, in order to minimize heat loss. Additionally, the structural and electrical service components are designed to accommodate the potential installation of a roof-mounted photovoltaic array. The Government is Yukon is providing $2,955,448 in addition to the Government of Canada’s investment of $8,866,344 for this project through the Small Communities Fund of the Investing in Canada Plan.            We are excited to be working with the Government of Canada to provide funding for this essential building for the Town of Faro. The community will benefit from this facility’s innovative and environmentally conscious design. It will house office-type spaces on the ground floor, and the second floor is a mezzanine for service spaces only. This includes seven vehicle bays; staff offices; shared meeting rooms; parts and tool storage; a morgue; and decontamination areas. We have worked collaboratively with the community to ensure this building meets their needs.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Residents of the Town of Faro will benefit from this state-of-the art building that will house vital fire response equipment and personnel, as well as essential public works staff and equipment needed in the community. This project to consolidate the fire hall and public works building is an efficient use of resources and goes to show just how municipal, territorial and federal governments can partner to bring these projects to reality, to the benefit of the community.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna            Today is a very exciting day for the Town of Faro! Improving and/or replacing aging municipal infrastructure continues to be a top priority for us as a Council and community. This new infrastructure will help to significantly improve safety and service quality to our community by our Volunteer Fire Service, Public Works, and the EMS departments. This project will also allow us to better support our neighbours and regional partners as well. Surely, this important project would not be possible without the full support and commitment of our Territorial and Federal funding partners, which we deeply value and appreciate.      Mayor of the Town of Faro Leonard Faber            Quick facts       Through the Investing in Canada plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.

The mass clinic for all eligible Yukoners will open in Whitehorse as soon as possible following the arrival of these doses. Opening the clinic to all Yukoners 18 and older reduces barriers for vaccine access, which aligns with recommendations that the greatest way to protect the community is to immunize as many individuals as quickly as possible. We have consistently pushed the federal government to recognize the importance of immunizing northern, remote and Indigenous communities. We appreciate how patient Yukoners have been and today’s confirmation is welcome news. Our planning teams are already at work to redesign clinic dates and delivery schedules so we can open up the Whitehorse clinic to all residents. We have hit some very notable milestones. All eligible people at the long-term care homes have now received their full immunizations. Homebound people in Whitehorse have also received their second dose and are now fully vaccinated. The mobile teams have visited all rural communities and are making their way back to offer second doses to everyone eligible and first doses to those who may have missed the opportunity. We would like to thank the incredible team of people who have been working hard to get eligible Yukoners immunized against COVID-19. Today’s commitment is very good news for Yukon.

Government of Yukon made a commitment to provide direction to the Yukon Utilities Board with respect to utility-led demand-side management in 2020.  The amendment requires the Yukon Utilities Board (YUB) to allow the utilities to recover reasonable demand-side management costs through rates while considering duplication with existing Yukon government programs.  The amendment also provides direction on treatment for the existing Low Water Reserve Fund, and will help to smooth rates that may be impacted by gaps between forecast and actual available renewable electricity including hydro, solar and wind.  Direction to the YUB on costs related to renewable electricity planning and development is important to support future renewable electricity projects included in Yukon Energy’s Ten-Year Renewable Electricity Plan.

These guidelines are iterative, the Government of Yukon intends to review the guidelines after a period of three years. In order to get a water licence, quartz mining proponents must submit an adaptive management plan outlining how they will manage water at their site. Until now, there has not been Yukon-specific guidance on what should be included in an adaptive management plan. These guidelines will fill that gap and make these plans more consistent, clear and efficient across Yukon. This standardized approach will help protect Yukon's freshwater, promote sustainable water use by industry, and help the industry prepare for unforeseen environmental conditions, such as the impacts of climate change.               It is important to all Yukoners to have healthy freshwater. We know industry can impact our water, and the development of these guidelines is very helpful to the environmental management of the quartz mining industry in Yukon. This guide shows us how governments and industry can work together to manage our natural resources responsibly.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            These guidelines will help to ensure that mineral production occurs in an environmentally responsible manner. The mineral sector is a major driver of Yukon's economy so we strive to ensure mining projects advance in a timely manner through a regulatory process that values high environmental standards and vigilant consideration of Yukon First Nations' and Yukoners' interests.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       The Yukon Water Board is a key player in water management in the territory. The board has endorsed the adaptive management plan guidelines and was actively involved in developing and reviewing the guidelines.  The guidelines do not change how the Yukon Water Board operates, but they will help reviewers, mining proponents, First Nation governments, and stakeholders better understand what should be in an adaptive management plan.  The guidelines will support development, review and engagement related to the development of adaptive management plans during the water licensing process.  Development of these guidelines started in 2017 as a goal of the Yukon Water Strategy and Action Plan.

Premier Sandy Silver and Minister Pauline Frost have released the following statement: “On Friday, January 29, Moderna announced a reduction in their next vaccine shipment to Canada, which is scheduled for between February 4 and 10.  The Government of Canada has notified our government that our next shipment of vaccine will be reduced by 37 per cent, from 7,200 doses to 4,500 doses. It is anticipated that our fourth shipment scheduled for late February will also be reduced from 7,200 to 4,500.  Yukon is one of many jurisdictions in Canada and around the world that will see reduced shipments of the COVID-19 vaccine in the coming weeks. Despite the reduced vaccine availability, mobile clinics scheduled for rural communities this week will continue, as will the clinic for those age 60 and older in Whitehorse. Work is also underway to schedule the second dose for all individuals who have received their first dose, starting with the residents and staff of our long-term care homes. These smaller shipments will impact the opening of the vaccine clinic for the general population in Whitehorse, which had been scheduled for February 10, 2021. We will have more information to share in the coming days about the opening of the clinic to those age 18 and older in Whitehorse. We remain committed to a safe and effective roll out of the vaccine delivery to all Yukon citizens. All those who have received a first dose by February 6, will receive their second dose of vaccine to ensure their full protection. We want to assure rural residents that their second doses are protected, and we will be returning to each community throughout February and the first two weeks of March. Yukon’s vaccine rollout schedule was designed to be flexible based on vaccine availability. The supply of vaccines remains the responsibility of the federal government and we continue to receive assurances that Yukon will receive its full allotment of doses before March 31, 2021. To date, the information that we have received still means that all Yukon citizens who would like to be immunized will be able to receive the vaccine by the end of April 2021. We want to thank our mobile immunizations teams, Balto and Togo, as well as the team at the Whitehorse clinic for all their efforts to ensure Yukoners are able to get their shots in a safe and efficient manner. We have come a long way over the past 11 months and we must continue to be patient and vigilant as the vaccine rollout continues. Continue practicing the Safe 6, mask up, and look after each other.”     Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136 matthew.cameron@yukon.ca     News release #:   21-034        "

Yukon families will have increased access to high quality, affordable childcare options for their children starting on April 1, 2021. Additionally, full-time early kindergarten programs will be offered in all rural Yukon schools starting in the 2021–22 school year. To support these initiatives and coordinate early learning services, the Child Care Services Unit will transfer to the Department of Education as of April 1, 2021. The Government of Yukon is currently engaging with Yukon First Nations governments and key stakeholders, including childcare operators and education partners, on how to create a universal childcare model for Yukon based on the principles of affordability, accessibility and quality, and enhanced early Kindergarten programming at all rural schools in Yukon. These actions are in direct response to Putting People First, a roadmap to transform Yukon’s health and social services system into a more integrated, collaborative and person-centred system that will better meet the needs of Yukoners. The Government of Yukon continues to work with partners on the implementation of Putting People First to ensure Yukoners have a better and more sustainable system for years to come.            Our government believes that all children should have access to affordable, high-quality childcare and early-learning opportunities. We know that families are struggling to afford the costs of childcare and we are taking action to make life more affordable. This is part of our ongoing work to provide more integrated, collaborative programs and services that will better meet the needs of Yukoners and Yukon families.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            We are very excited to be moving forward on these early learning initiatives that will support learning and improve our long-term health and education outcomes for Yukon children, families and communities. We look forward to continuing working in partnership with First Nations governments, childcare operators and providers, and education partners on the implementation of universal childcare and early Kindergarten in rural schools.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            Quick facts       The 2019 Speech from the Throne committed to expanding early kindergarten programming to rural Yukon communities.  In July 2020, Premier Silver announced that Yukon would be moving to a universal, affordable childcare system.  In August 2020, the Government of Yukon endorsed Putting People First, the final report of Yukon’s comprehensive review of health and social program and services. The report’s recommendations will make services more effective, provide better value for money and improve outcomes and experiences for clients, patients, families and health and social service providers.  In 2018 and 2019 the Government of Yukon undertook extensive engagements with First Nations governments, childcare operators, Early Childhood Educators, families and stakeholders in the childcare sector to better understand the needs of children and families in their communities.  The services provided by the Child Care Services Unit include licensing and monitoring childcare programs, and processing funding programs such as the Child Care Subsidy Program, Direct Operating Grant and Supported Child Care Program applications and renewals.           Contact   Renée Francoeur 	Cabinet Communications 	867-334-9194 renee.francoeur@yukon.ca Julie Ménard 	Communications, Health and Social Services 	867-667-8478 julie.menard@yukon.ca Kyle Nightingale 	Communications, Education 	867-336-0653 kyle.nightingale@yukon.ca     News release #:   21-032    Related information:   What we heard: early learning and child care engagement report        "

The new Midwifery Regulation, under the Health Professions Act, will work alongside standards of practice and a code of ethics to assure Yukoners that licensed midwives in the territory have met qualification standards and that there are rules in place to support the safe practice of midwifery in Yukon. Under the Regulation, licensed midwives will be able to practice as they do elsewhere in Canada, supporting clients through pregnancy, birth and the post-partum period. The Midwifery Regulation, standards of practice and code of ethics will take effect on April 15, 2021. The Department of Health and Social Services continues to work towards the launch of funded and regulated midwifery services in fall 2021.            I am proud to announce today that we have completed the Midwifery Regulation that will allow licensed midwives to safely support mothers through pregnancy, birth and the post-partum period. This is an important step towards realizing our government’s commitment to providing regulated and funded midwifery services as a birthing option for Yukoners.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            We are very excited to have the regulatory framework finalized.  A lot of work and input from health care professionals and the community have led us to this point. We are very grateful for their expertise and look forward to working with them in partnership as we move forward to integrate midwifery care into the existing health care system in a way that is safe, sustainable and complements existing services.       Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            After many years of hard work of advocacy, CMAY is very excited to see the regulations come through. We know that there is still much work to do and are looking forward to development of Standards of Practice, and especially the implementation of Midwifery and midwives actually working as part of Yukon Health Care aligned with the Canadian Model of Midwifery Care.      Community Midwifery Association Yukon Interim President Christina Kaiser            Quick facts       The development of the regulatory framework for midwifery in Yukon involved extensive engagement, consultation and research. This included: seeking the advice of a Midwifery Advisory Committee made of up of key healthcare partners; public engagement with Yukoners, midwives, physicians, and nurses; consultation with the Canadian Association of Midwives and regulators of midwifery in other Canadian jurisdictions; incorporation of best practices from other Canadian jurisdictions; and consideration of Yukon’s unique context.  Yukon’s Midwifery Regulation establishes a regulatory framework similar to British Columbia (B.C.), allowing the adoption of many of B.C.’s standards of practice as initial Yukon standards, as well as other initial standards unique to Yukon. Over time, the Registrar of Midwives will work with the advisory committee established under the Regulation to review and adapt standards as necessary to reflect the evolution of midwifery practice in Yukon.  The Regulation identifies such items as licensing requirements; required professional liability insurance; the range of services midwives can legally provide; and the creation of an advisory committee.  The midwifery program is expected to take a phased approach to the implementation of regulated and funded midwifery services in Yukon by first focusing on establishment of full midwifery services in Whitehorse.

Minister responsible for the Public Service Commission Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       Since the inception of these awards, there have been 128 nominees, 29 recipients, four special recognition awards and one posthumous award.  The Aboriginal Employees Forum was created in 2007 to support new Indigenous employees as they transition into Yukon government. As an employee network, the Forum provides members with opportunities to meet colleagues from other departments, access a cultural support system and professional development opportunities. Over the years, the group has transformed into a recruiting and retention mechanism for Indigenous employees and demonstrates Yukon government’s commitment to reconciliation.  Breaking Trail Together is a Government of Yukon plan to increase representation of First Nations employees in the public service. The plan was developed in collaboration with Yukon First Nations governments and addresses the Government of Yukon’s legal obligation under the Final Agreements to develop and implement a Representative Public Service Plan.          Backgrounder   This year’s Indigenous Employees Award of Honour recipient is: Morgane Pennycook: Morgane is a senior negotiator in the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources.

The regulation will provide an effective regime to prevent, reduce and mitigate the environmental impacts of off-road vehicle use on public land, while recognizing the needs of responsible off-road vehicle users. The new regulation will also assist the Government of Yukon in meeting commitments made with respect to planned areas such as the Peel watershed region and Ddhaw Ghro Habitat Protection Area. The Off-Road Vehicle Management Area Regulation was developed following extensive engagement with Yukon First Nations, stakeholders and the public over the last decade.            Yukoners have told us that regulating off-road vehicle use is needed to address environmental impacts related to increased ORV use in the backcountry and we have listened.  Off-road vehicles give Yukoners access to the backcountry for work, hunting and recreation, and this access may have impacts on sensitive terrain and habitats.  Our government has worked with Yukoners to develop regulations that will protect the landscape and continue to allow people to use their off-road vehicles responsibly for work and recreation.      Energy, Mines and Resources Minister Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       The regulation of off-road vehicles covers all-terrain vehicles such as quads, side-by-sides, amphibious vehicles such as ARGOs, mini-bikes, dirt bikes and any motor vehicle that is being driven elsewhere than a highway, regardless of whether it is registered under the Motor Vehicles Act.   The Regulation initially creates three Management Areas, including Alpine Areas, a portion of the Peel Watershed region and the Ddhaw Ghro Habitat Protection Area. Providing direction for Off-Road Vehicle (ORV) restriction in these special places enables the Government of Yukon to meet commitments made in the context of those planning processes. These management areas do not restrict the use of snowmobiles.

We look forward to working with the community on this important project and getting started on construction.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            2021 will be 104 years since Kluane First Nation had asked for a school to be built in Burwash Landing.  We are pleased to be working in partnership with the Government of Yukon to build a new school.  One that will be based on our language, culture, and traditions for all ages, and will be useful for education purposes and for the Community as a whole. With a new school, Kluane First Nation is hopeful that this will help to both retain our Citizens and encourage our Citizens to move home to the community, which will lead to building capacity for the First Nation Government.       Kluane First Nation Chief Bob Dickson            Quick facts       Students have been attending Kluane Lake School in Destruction Bay since 1961.

Following four years of regulatory assessment, this decision creates unreasonable and unnecessary uncertainty for the proponent and sends a troubling signal.  The Government of Canada absolutely needs to take steps to streamline these processes going forward to ensure greater clarity and certainty for the mining industry. I have written to Chair of YESAB to inform them that the Yukon government was prepared to accept the recommendations and issue a decision document. Unfortunately, due to the Government of Canada’s decision, we cannot issue a decision document accepting the recommendations at this time. The Government of Yukon does not agree with the decision to refer the project back to the Executive Committee for reconsideration. We feel the YESAA process has resulted in a comprehensive review and analysis of the project, and the recommendation to proceed with additional mitigations and monitoring is reasonable. We remain committed to consulting on the project to ensure potential impacts to Kaska Nations asserted rights are addressed and we will continue to work with all parties to best ensure that we can continue to move forward.""

This is an important step towards reversing the former administration’s efforts to open the critical habitat to industrial development and will help maintain the sustainability of the important Porcupine caribou herd. The Government of Yukon continues to work with our partners in Porcupine Caribou management, the governments of Canada and the Northwest Territories, Inuvialuit, Gwich’in Tribal Council, Vuntut Gwitchin, Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in and First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun. Minister of Environment Pauline Frost released the following statement: “While the executive order is only a temporary moratorium, it states that the United States Government will review the instruments that put this oil and gas program in place and conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of the potential environmental impacts it could cause. Together with other Canadian parties to the Porcupine Caribou Management Agreement, we intervened and decried the lack of attention to scientifically-proven environmental impacts at every available opportunity throughout the regulatory process. We presented our shared analysis of decades-long scientific research, which clearly demonstrates development in the crucial calving grounds will have significant negative impacts on the herd and the corresponding subsistence and cultural practices of the many communities who rely on this caribou. There is still a long way to go to seeing permanent protection of this unique and important herd and we are saddened by the nine lease tracts sold on January 19. But we will not stop demanding adequate protection for this herd and their critical habitat. We will continue to collect and analyze data that supports decision making based on strong, current science, and long-established traditional knowledge. We will continue to engage with our management partners in Alaska and the United States federal government. With this new executive order, which sends a signal that is consistent with our shared values of informed, science-based decision making, we will continue our efforts with renewed optimism and enthusiasm.”     Contact    Matthew Cameron 		Cabinet Communications 		867-393-7136 matthew.cameron@yukon.ca      News release #:   21-020    Related information:   Arctic National Wildlife Refuge        "

The Department of Education is currently in the process of hiring 11 additional educators to support the three Whitehorse high schools that are providing half-day in-class programming as well as the Wood Street Centre and 12 educators to support elementary and rural schools. Staff will be deployed in various positions to support students, including success coaches, learning assistance teachers and blended learning and counselling supports. An additional $150,000 in funding support has also been made available to schools, organizations and Yukon First Nations governments for tutoring programs to enhance supports for students. Resources needed to support student learning continue to be monitored, while school operations and programming has been adapted to meet health and safety guidelines during the pandemic. The Government of Yukon has heard from students, families and school staff through its Learning during COVID-19 surveys, which provided additional feedback to regular assessment and reporting on student learning by educators. The results of the second Learning during COVID-19 survey are now available on engageyukon.ca.            We are committed to ensuring students and teachers are successful and safe at school as we continue to respond to the pandemic. We value the feedback from students, families and educators and appreciate the challenges they are facing in an unprecedented school year. These additional supports are part of our ongoing effort to help students and educators deal with the impacts of the pandemic across our education system.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            Quick facts       The second Learning during COVID-19 survey was open from November 23 to November 30 and was completed by 2,085 respondents, including 1,340 parents, 496 students and 249 school staff. Respondents were asked about their experiences and perspectives since the beginning of the school year on:  health and safety routines at Yukon schools; learning now that students are back at school; and blended learning for Grade 10 to 12 students at F.H. Collins, Porter Creek and Vanier Catholic secondary schools.   Survey questions for the Learning during COVID-19 surveys were developed with opportunities for input from Yukon First Nations, school councils, the Association of Yukon School Councils, Boards and Committees, the Catholic Education Association of Yukon, Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon and the Yukon Teachers’ Association.

The drive-thru, located at Centennial Motors, 91628 Alaska Highway, in the wash bay, will no longer be open or available for testing people with symptoms. The drive-thru testing centre was opened on November 23, 2020 to help meet the increased demand for testing. Since its opening, 816 people were tested at the drive-thru. Due to the low testing rates, this additional location is no longer needed. The COVID-19 Testing and Assessments Center remains open for screening and assessment needs from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Sunday. The center can be found at 49 Waterfront place in Whitehorse. The alternative COVID-19 mouth rinse and gargle test option is now available for children and youth ages 5 to 18 years old. Anyone who is experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 should get tested. To arrange for testing, people should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 in Whitehorse. For medical questions or if people feel ill they should phone 811 or use the COVID-19 self-assessment tool.            The drive-thru was opened in the interest of serving more Yukoners. As we saw a gradual rise in cases, it was essential to increase our testing capacity while providing a convenient and efficient location for people to get tested. It was a great success but after much evaluation and a decrease in demand for testing, we have decided at this time to close the drive-thru centre. If circumstances were to change and more facilities are needed in the future, we can swiftly re-open centres to accommodate this need.

The individual recipients are Andrew Smith, Josee Bergeron and Bobbi Rhodes. The team recipients are the Dawson and Mayo Modernization Infrastructure Team; Mental Wellness and Substance Use Immunization Team; and the Our Clean Future Strategy Development Team.            I am consistently impressed by the work that is being carried out by Government of Yukon employees, especially during a really tough year that challenged us in so many ways. Congratulations to all of the 2020 nominees and award recipients. Thank you for your service and your ongoing contribution to our territory.      Premier Sandy Silver            Quick facts       The Premier’s Award of Excellence and Innovation was established in 2005 and recognizes Government of Yukon employees’ exceptional accomplishments and celebrates their talent and teamwork.  The recipients are chosen by the Premier’s Award of Excellence and Innovation Selection Committee, which includes Government of Yukon employees from several departments and one community representative.          Backgrounder   Andrew Smith, Intergovernmental Relations Analyst, Intergovernmental Relations, Executive Council Office In the fall of 2020, Andrew Smith was tasked to take the lead on Yukon government’s time change initiative. Early on in the project, it became very clear that no one could provide a playbook for time zone legislation; it was very much a path not yet travelled. The project had a hard timeline and a great public interest, resulting in Yukon’s largest ever response for a public engagement. Despite the foreign territory, Andrew led this high-profile initiative with expertise, envisioning a project path, reaching out to experts within and outside government and turning unknowns into actionable steps to move the project forward. Josee Bergeron, Executive Assistant, Deputy Minister's Office, Community Services In a short amount of time, Josee has had lasting impact on those around her. In addition to her role as an administrative assistant, she consistently demonstrates leadership by stepping up to support and advance the work of other branches in the department. Josee is a self-starter and is quick to take on projects that are beyond her normal duties. She collaborates with other admin assistants in other departments, and is always looking for ways to streamline processes and provide better, faster service. She frequently covers for her counterparts in other teams while maintaining her own duties and has trained new admin assistants in other departments. Josee’s attitude and actions have helped to foster strong, positive relationships throughout the department. Bobbi Rhodes, Realty Officer, Realty and Planning Services, Highways and Public Works Bobbi has shown incredible initiative and caring for her fellow employees by openly sharing her own journeys in mental health and mindfulness. On her own time, she created a weekly email called “Mindful Mondays” and volunteers to deliver a workshop on mindfulness to share with colleagues. Now, more than 300 employees, across the Yukon government, receive her weekly email and the ripple effects of her authentic and honest sharing have been profound. Bobbi is a tireless advocate for healthy and safe workplaces and destigmatizing the topic of mental health. Through her gentle nudging, more employees have found their own voices and felt comfortable sharing their own experiences and struggles with mental health. Dawson and Mayo Modernization Infrastructure Team The Dawson and Mayo Modernization Infrastructure Team’s expertise and teamwork have led to major improvements in community airports. Over the past three years, this team led a large-scale collaboration between government and the private sector to design, construct and commission $26 million worth of major upgrades. This includes the first runway to be converted from gravel to pavement in the North in 25 years. This team consistently demonstrated the importance of teamwork, collaboration and strong communication within government and with private sector partners. Mental Wellness and Substance Use Immunization Team This is a highly energetic, innovative and collaborative team of clinicians and health professionals. Through their work, they have directly contributed to the health and wellbeing of some of Yukon’s most vulnerable and complex patients. Not only are they high-performers, the team is extremely dedicated to patient-centered care and serve as inspiration to others for their ability to communicate, build trust and meet people wherever they are at. Known for being innovative and going above and beyond their regular duties, this team has worked to ensure that flu clinics were available to the marginalized population they serve. On top of their already busy duties, they completed training and provided clinics at the Whitehorse Emergency Shelter and Housing First. Our Clean Future Over the past three years, the team responsible for developing Our Clean Future worked closely with First Nations, municipal governments, NGOs, businesses and many other experts. The result of this hard work was a Yukon strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy. It is an initiative with an extremely talented and dedicated team that addresses a very large, complex and urgent issue. This team collaboratively developed a strategy that charts the way for Yukon to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. The work of the Our Clean Future team was an example of how strong and meaningful partnerships with stakeholders can lead to exceptional engagement and collaboration. The project team was tirelessly dedicated to keeping their partners informed and engaged in every step of the process.

261,2021-01-18,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/shingles-and-hpv-vaccines-are-now-available-pharmacies,Government Website,Shingles and HPV vaccines are now available in pharmacies,"           Published 18/01/2021        Vaccinations are one of the most effective public health interventions for promoting and maintaining good health. To support Yukoners’ long-term wellbeing and quality of life, the Government of Yukon is publicly funding the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, for Yukoners between the ages of 65 and 70. In addition to this, the Government of Yukon is also expanding the eligibility of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine program to include all Yukoners up to and including age 26. Shingles is a viral infection caused by the same virus as chickenpox, which causes a painful rash. The shingles vaccine lowers the risk of getting shingles significantly and reduces the chance of complications from this disease for people without medical contraindications. HPV is a common virus spread mainly through sexual contact. It is related to almost all cases of cervical cancer and many other HPV-related cancers in both males and females. Those who are eligible for the shingles vaccine will need to contact their doctor or nurse practitioner to obtain a prescription. All Yukoners who are between the ages of 65 and 70 on January 1, 2021, are eligible to receive the vaccine at no cost. The HPV-9 vaccine doesn’t require a prescription. Effective today, both vaccines can be administered at a local pharmacy free of charge. Yukoners who live in a community without a rural dispensary or pharmacy will need to come to Whitehorse to receive their vaccines. These visits will be covered by the Yukon Medical Travel program. A pharmacist or a physician will need to confirm the visit by submitting a Medical Travel subsidy form. The Government of Yukon encourages all Yukoners receiving one of these vaccines to speak to their doctor or pharmacist about their vaccination schedule to ensure they are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. It is recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine not be administered with a different vaccine for a period of at least 14 days prior to or 28 days after.            Making the shingles and HPV vaccines available free of charge for eligible Yukoners is another way our government is investing in preventative health care and the wellbeing of Yukoners. This is a direct response to recommendations made in the Putting People First and Aging in Place What We Heard report. By including the shingles vaccine and expanding the HPV vaccine in Yukon’s publicly funded immunization program, we will help protect those who are highly susceptible to contracting these diseases.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Funding the shingles vaccine and the expansion of the HPV vaccine is in line with a recommendation in the Putting People First report, as well as feedback received as part of the Aging in Place public engagement.  The HPV-9 vaccine is provided in schools starting in Grade 6. Individuals who missed an HPV vaccination will be able to access the HPV-9 vaccine up to and including age 26. If a Yukoner has not received the vaccine in school or has not received the required doses two or three doses depending on the individual’s age, they can make an appointment with their local pharmacy to receive the vaccine.  Vaccines can help reduce the risk of shingles. Shingrix is a two-dose, non-live vaccine that has been shown to be 90 per cent effective in preventing shingles.  The shingles vaccine is available to all eligible Yukoners at any pharmacy at no cost. If a Yukoner is outside the age range identified, they can still receive the vaccine but will be required to pay out of pocket.

The committee reviewed and provided their feedback on the Public Airports Act Regulations. The committee was provided with Flight Path, a 10-year investment strategy developed by Stantec Consulting Ltd. which provides investment tools and recommendations about the future of investment in Yukon’s aviation system. The committee also took part in important discussions with NAV Canada on their current service level review at the Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport control tower.            Yukon’s Aviation Advisory Committee is instrumental in providing guidance and advice on the future of the aviation industry and the management of the infrastructure that supports this critical link for people, goods and services. I look forward to hearing its thoughts on these important matters.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            The Yukon Aviation Advisory Committee is pleased to have had a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the draft Public Airports Regulations. The committee and Yukon government also spoke with a united voice expressing our safety concerns to NAV Canada and we are hopeful they listened.      Yukon Aviation Advisory Committee Chair David Sharp            Quick facts       The committee’s feedback on the Public Airports Regulations is being reviewed by the Government of Yukon. The regulations are expected to be approved this spring.  The committee will work with the Government of Yukon to develop a response to Flight Path’s recommendations to support implementation which will guide investment decisions over the next 10 years.  Since the start of the pandemic, the Government of Yukon has invested more than $10 million into Yukon’s aviation sector.

As of January 1, 2021, the medical travel subsidy is $150 per day for multi-day travel for out-patients and for escorts accompanying in-patients. Patients and escorts will have access to a $75 per day subsidy for same day travel. Beginning in 2022, the subsidy will be indexed yearly to the Canadian Consumer Price Index. Authorized practitioners can now recommend travel anywhere in Canada, giving more flexibility in determining the most appropriate destination to respond to their patients’ needs. To reflect the new vision of medical travel, a new care coordination and medical travel unit will be created in 2021–22. The unit will deliver wraparound support to all Yukoners travelling for medical treatment, including those travelling through other insurance programs such as Non-Insured Health Benefits. Additionally, on December 31, 2020, the rural zone subsidy for travel to Whitehorse for specialist and laboratory visits by Whitehorse periphery residents ended.            I am pleased to announce that with the approval to amend the Travel for Medical Treatment Regulations we are acting on the Putting People First recommendations. Our government is committed to reducing the financial strain faced by Yukoners travelling for medical treatment in and out of territory. I am proud of these improvements that are moving Yukon toward a more holistic and people-centred health and social services system that will better meet the needs of Yukoners.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Putting People First is the final report of Yukon’s comprehensive review of health and social program and services.  The list of destination cities currently limits travel to Vancouver, Calgary or Edmonton.

264,2021-01-14,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/local-area-planning-process-start-lu-zil-man-fish-lake-area,Government Website,Local area planning process to start for the Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) area,"           Published 14/01/2021          Joint news release with Kwanlin Dün First Nation The Government of Yukon and Kwanlin Dün First Nation are launching a local area planning process for the Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) area. This process is initiated under Section 30 of Kwanlin Dün First Nation’s Self-Government Agreement, where two governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding in March 2020 to develop a local area plan for the Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) area. The planning process involves consultation with all members of the community and other stakeholders. Throughout the process, the steering committee engages with the public, stakeholders, First Nations Citizens, and gathers feedback for consideration. A consultant is working on a background report that will help guide the development of the local area plan. Additionally, a steering committee comprised of representatives from both governments will be established to coordinate and develop the recommendations for this cooperative plan.            The local area planning process is invaluable in guiding land development and reducing land use conflicts in an area. The process provides local residents and those with strong ties to the area with the opportunity to influence the decisions about land use and ensures broad public interests are taken into consideration. Given the proximity of Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) to Whitehorse, its popularity as a recreational and tourism area, and its importance to Kwanlin Dün First Nation and Ta’an Kwächän Council, this local area planning process will be of high interest to many. We look forward to working cooperatively with Kwanlin Dün First Nation, Ta’an Kwächän Council and the community on developing a local area plan for this beautiful and popular area.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) has always been an important site to the people of Kwanlin Dün First Nation. Our ancestors have used the land and water for sustenance for many thousands of years. Our strong connection to the site continues today. As we embark on this process in partnership with the Government of Yukon, we look forward to building a plan that will honour the traditional uses of the area and balance our modern uses with conservation of the land, water and wildlife, and with the treaty rights of KDFN citizens. This is the first local area planning process to take place under Kwanlin Dün First Nation’s newly enacted Lands Act Nan kay sháwthän Däk'anúta ch'e (We look after our land). It signifies another step forward in our First Nation’s self-determination.      Kwanlin Dün First Nation Chief Doris Bill            Quick facts       Interested parties can submit expressions of interest to be part of the Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) Local Area Plan Steering Committee with the Government of Yukon until February 15, 2021.  This is the first local area planning process initiated under Kwanlin Dün First Nation’s new Lands Act, Nan kay sháwthän Däk'anúta ch'e, that came into force in October 2020.  Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) area is approximately 460 square kilometres. It is located west of the City of Whitehorse. Current land use includes a mixture of rural residential, agricultural, commercial, recreational, and subsistence activities.  Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) is located in the Traditional Territory of the Kwanlin Dün First Nation. Ta’an Kwächän Council also has a site specific parcel in the area.          Backgrounder   On Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) area Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) area is located in the Traditional Territory of the Kwanlin Dün First Nation.   It is named for the round whitefish that spawn there in the fall. First Nations families and their ancestors have fished, trapped, hunted and gathered in the Fish Lake area for millennia and they continue to do so today. The Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) area is significant to Kwanlin Dün First Nation who has a large amount of Settlement Lands in the Fish Lake valley, though the entire area is known to be important to First Nations people. Ta’an Kwächän Council also has a long history of use in the area and has a site specific parcel located within the Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) local area plan’s boundaries. Archeological digs in the Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) area show evidence of human occupation dating from historic times to the end of the last Ice Age. The largest site was a traditional fish camp on the north end of the lake. The types of tools found at this site show people have been using it for at least 5,000 to 8,000 years. More than 40 other archaeological sites are known to exist in the area and additional sites are very likely.  A local area plan for Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake) will identify public land and Kwanlin Dün First Nation Settlement Lands for residential use, traditional use and community development. Kwanlin Dün First Nation says this will help Citizens reconnect to their ancestral home at Fish Lake. On the local area planning process A local area plan designates areas for specific land uses. It also defines a community’s vision for the future and guides the development and use of land in unincorporated Yukon communities. Where possible, the Government of Yukon and First Nations whose traditional territory includes the planning area work in partnership on the local area planning process. Together they establish the boundary of the local area plan and strike a steering committee. The steering committee comprises residents of the local area with an equal representation of nominees from the Government of Yukon and First Nations. The steering committee will follow a number of steps to create a local area plan. It:  works with planning staff from each government to develop terms of reference for the planning contract; selects a planning consultant who will facilitate the development of the plan; reviews background analysis (prepared by planning consultant); develops a vision for the community; presents plan options; develops a preferred plan; and recommends the plan for approval.  The planning process involves consultation with all members of the community and other stakeholders. Throughout the process, the steering committee engages with the public, stakeholders and First Nations Citizens and gathers feedback for consideration. The recommended plan is reviewed and approved by the Government of Yukon and if the plan is prepared jointly with a First Nation, it is reviewed and approved by Chief and Councils. Once approved, the local area plan guides decision making in an area as it includes recommendations for managing existing uses, such as residential and agricultural, and future community development and land use activities. Local area plans are implemented through area development regulations, also known as zoning. The local area planning process can take a few years to be completed. Local area plans are reviewed every five to 10 years to ensure they reflect changing conditions and values in a community. Local area plans may be amended from time to time to reflect changing land use demands or economic conditions. Plan amendments are subject to public consultation. On getting involved with local area planning The public can get involved in a local area planning process by attending public meetings, completing surveys and by providing input and suggestions to the steering committee. Yukon residents may put their name forward for consideration to be on a steering committee.

It also builds on the Government of Yukon’s immediate efforts to clear the Alaska Highway and facilitate the movement of support from the rest of Alaska.            Our shared geography with Alaska makes us neighbours, but our shared interests make us friends. Yukoners were shocked and saddened at the tragic news of the loss of life, flooding and ensuing disaster.

This person was initially tested outside of the territory using a point-of-care rapid test, which gave a positive result. To confirm the results, the Government of Yukon requested a second test using the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that is considered to be the gold standard in COVID-19 testing. Out of an abundance of caution, close contacts of the individual were instructed to self-isolate while we investigated the situation and awaited the result of the gold standard test. A negative result was confirmed on Thursday afternoon and Yukon Communicable Disease Centre contacted all individuals who were in self-isolation. Those who were in isolation solely due to their contact with this individual were able to resume regular activities.  There is no evidence of community transmission. At this time, Yukon has 10 active cases in two clusters among household or family contacts.            We took a very proactive approach after hearing this individual had received a positive result outside of the territory. We asked all identified contacts to self-isolate to avoid potential spread of the disease. We are relieved and very grateful for the cooperation of this person and their close contacts and are pleased that further confirmatory testing is negative.

268,2021-01-08,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/work-protect-porcupine-caribou-will-continue,Government Website,Work to protect Porcupine caribou will continue,"           Published 08/01/2021        Partners to the Canadian Porcupine Caribou Management Agreement came together on January 6, 2021 to respond to the recent oil and gas lease sale in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). The parties are committed to advocating for protection of the Porcupine caribou herd and this vital habitat. Together, the parties released this statement: “Drilling in the ANWR protected areas is not sustainable for Porcupine caribou or other key species like polar bears. We are disappointed that the US government proceeded with the lease sale on Wednesday, January 6, despite significant concerns we have raised which remain unaddressed. However, we are pleased the sale attracted little attention from major oil companies, who have recognized that drilling in this area is neither acceptable nor profitable. We believe this is a result of our collective action, as well as a lack of local support and economic viability. We will continue to work collaboratively to oppose oil and gas development in the ANWR protected areas and to protect the Porcupine caribou herd and its habitat, now and for future generations.”            The Government of Yukon is steadfast in its opposition to oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We are disappointed that the lease sale went ahead on January 6. Development activities in this vital habitat have the potential to harm important transboundary wildlife, and in turn, the people who rely on them. We will continue to stand in solidarity with our partners, advocating for the protection of the Porcupine caribou herd’s sacred and sensitive calving grounds on the Alaskan coastal plain.      Government of Yukon Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            The Government of Canada continues to oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge due to the potential impacts on transboundary wildlife, particularly for the Porcupine caribou and the Indigenous Peoples who depend on them. Given the sale of leases yesterday generated less than 1 percent of the estimated revenue, the market has made abundantly clear that drilling in this pristine and culturally significant area is not only economically unfeasible, but environmentally and morally unacceptable.      Minister of Environment and Climate Change Jonathan Wilkinson            For 30 years, Canada has supported the Gwitchin in fighting development in ANWR, the ‘Serengeti of the North.’ On January 6, 2021, the lease sale was largely unsuccessful due in part to our collective action. Major corporations understand that their reputations would be tarnished if they participated in the development of ANWR.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell            It is essential for the long-term health of the Porcupine Caribou herd that their calving grounds remain pristine. Through our unwavering opposition to development in the ANWR, Canada continues to make it clear that putting the future of this herd in jeopardy is entirely unacceptable.      Member of Parliament for the Northwest Territories Michael McLeod            Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in remains firmly opposed to any oil and gas development within the critical calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou Herd. We are deeply disappointed with the short-sighted actions of the outgoing US Government administration, who proceeded this week to auction off oil and gas leases to portions of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge—an area known to be critical to the well-being of the Porcupine Caribou Herd. We fear that without further intervention, this herd now faces a grave future, as do all the communities who depend on Porcupine caribou for food security and cultural well-being. In our shared role as stewards of the herd, we remain committed to advocating for the Porcupine Caribou Herd and will not rest until the 1002 lands of ANWR receive permanent protection from oil and gas development.      Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Chief Roberta Joseph            We are disappointed in the decision to allow the lease sale to go ahead. The Gwich’in Tribal Council remains resolute in our commitment to protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), a vital habitat for the Porcupine Caribou. Drilling for hydrocarbons in the ANWR would be devastating to Porcupine caribou and therefore our people and culture. We will continue to do everything we can to protect this sacred area alongside our many domestic and global partners. With that said, there are many other legal and regulatory avenues for us to pursue to achieve the long term protections we seek for the ANWR and the Porcupine Caribou herd.      Gwich’in Tribal Council Grand Chief Ken Smith            It was disheartening to hear the bids that had come in from those interested in destroying our sacred lands after decades of advocacy by my Elders, after decades of sharing our knowledge and voicing our concerns and after all of the work each of our Governments have done to protect critical habitat of the Porcupine caribou herd. The Gwich’in are connected to the caribou and our fates are intertwined. The fates of these lands are not yet sealed and we will continue our work until the critical calving grounds of the Porcupine caribou herd are permanently protected.      Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Chief Dana Tizya-Tramm            The Inuvialuit have depended on the Porcupine Caribou for hundreds of years for food, cultural and social well-being. The important role of this caribou herd is reflected in the protections and conservation measures provided under the Inuvialuit Final Agreement. These include provisions for the implementation of the Porcupine Caribou Management Agreement (PCMA), the establishment of Ivvavik National Park and the conservation measures for the Yukon North Slope as means to cooperatively manage the herd and protect the Porcupine Caribou calving grounds and habitat that lay within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region.  The Inuvialuit Game Council is not against development but feels there needs to be a balance struck between economic gain and indigenous cultural and social well-being. The Council is troubled by regulatory decisions that do not take into account the potentially negative impacts that opening ANWR to oil and gas development may have on this herd, the habitat it relies on and the many indigenous groups that depend on it for their traditional practices. The Inuvialuit Game Council continues to work with the other Parties to ensure the persistence of this herd for future generations.      Inuvialuit Game Council acting chair Jim Elias            The Government of the Northwest Territories remains deeply concerned about the decision to open up development leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge despite the potential of significant impacts to our shared wildlife, including Porcupine caribou and polar bears. The GNWT understands that the establishment of ANWR was itself a measure to balance wildlife and habitat needs with those of responsible development. I am hopeful the decision to remove some of the most important habitat for these species from the lease sale is a sign that our concerns are being heard as we continue to work with our co-management partners to support the subsistence harvest by Gwich’in and Inuvialuit in the NWT.

Two mobile teams will provide vaccinations in communities across the territory, starting the week of January 18, 2021. Each mobile team will travel with multiple immunizers providing the vaccine to as many people as possible while they are in each community. The Whitehorse vaccination clinic is scheduled to open the week of January 18, 2021. Vaccinations started on January 4, 2021, for long-term care home residents and staff. In the first three days, 310 Yukoners were immunized. Over the next several weeks, vaccinations will be available for other priority groups, including front line health care staff and older adults, as well as high-risk and vulnerable populations. The schedule is subject to change based on the availability and uptake of vaccines. Yukon is expected to receive enough doses of the Moderna vaccine to vaccinate 75 per cent of the adult population by the end of March. The supply of vaccines is determined by the Government of Canada. Information will be updated regularly on Yukon.ca as the rollout progresses.            We are ready to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine in a safe, effective and timely way. Over the next several weeks, our teams of trained and knowledgeable immunizers will visit every community across our territory. Our first doses are being used to protect our most vulnerable and, in the coming months, all adult Yukoners will have the opportunity to receive immunization and help bring us one step closer to ending the pandemic.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Vaccines have been our best defence against many diseases and COVID-19 is no different. I encourage everyone to take advantage of the vaccine and follow the example set by our Elders and seniors who have come forward. We need at least 75 per cent of us to be immunized if our community is to be protected and eventually to see our public health measures lifted.      Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       At end of the day on January 6, a total of 310 Yukoners had been immunized.

Provide your input on details of the ban including timing for implementation, exemptions that should be allowed and any issues or barriers related to implementing the ban. Banning single-use shopping bags will help reduce waste in Yukon and protect the environment. This public engagement will ensure the ban is introduced in a way that works for Yukoners, businesses and municipalities. Share your thoughts banning single-use shopping bags on EngageYukon.ca. Feedback will be accepted until March 8, 2021.            A quick trip to any of Yukon’s waste facilities will show the blight of single-use shopping bags. This engagement is the next step in our commitment to ban single-use shopping bags. We have heard before that Yukoners support the ban, but it is important for us to know how we can best implement this change. We want to ensure a green future for all Yukoners where we reduce our waste and prevent plastics from overwhelming our landscape.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Single-use shopping bags include plastic and paper. There is a lot of focus on the impact of single-use plastics however, paper bags are also a concern because they are resource-intensive, and cause pollution and emissions when they are made and transported.  The ban is not proposed to cover: 	   prescription bags provided by pharmacists; bags sold as products for waste such as bags for garbage, compost and animal waste; bags sold as products for snacks, sandwiches or freezer-type bags; and bags provided as primary packaging for food, produce, bakery items, meat, fast food, deli items, and hardware bulk items.

This draft strategy for supporting the creative and cultural industries is the first of its kind for Yukon, presenting 22 specific actions under four strategic objectives: stimulate growth, focusing policies, developing programs and services, strengthening connections and fostering knowledge. Building on current government supports, the strategy lays out a long-term vision for the creative and cultural sector to increase its contributions to positive social outcomes and economic sustainability in Yukon. All of the actions in the strategy build on input gathered from individuals and organizations who work in the industries, during two phases of public engagement held in 2019. This final round of feedback will ensure the government finalizes a strategy that will be effective and achievable, and address the needs and challenges expressed by those in the sector. Creative Potential: Advancing Yukon’s Creative Economy is open for review and feedback until February 5, 2021. A final strategy is anticipated for release in April 2021. The strategy is being developed collaboratively between the departments of Tourism and Culture, Economic Development and Education with guidance from the Women’s Directorate. 	             Yukon’s creative and cultural industries are integral to our well-being as a society and to maintaining a diverse economy. This strategy puts a focus on supporting these industries to flourish and acknowledges the immense value they contribute to Yukon. We want to make sure the proposed actions reflect the needs of the industries to ensure the final strategy will be successful in making notable change and improvements for the sector.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie McLean            The importance of Yukon’s creative and cultural industries cannot be understated. This sector contributes so much to how our territory is presented on the global stage while helping to diversify our economy. By creating opportunities to access new markets, we can showcase Yukon’s vibrant communities, their stories, knowledge and traditions to the world.       Minister of Department Economic Development Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       The creative and cultural industries facilitate the production or reproduction, promotion, distribution and commercialization of goods, services and activities of content derived from cultural, artistic or heritage origins.   The creative and cultural industries include sound recording, visual and applied arts, crafting, audio-visual and interactive media, film, photography, graphic design, architecture, live performance, theatre, written and published works, sound and lighting technicians, heritage and libraries as well as the labour force and institutions required to support them.  According to Statistics Canada, Yukon’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) derived from the cultural sector, was $59.7 million in 2018 and accounted for two per cent of our economy.  Previous public engagement phases included a one-day gathering in Whitehorse on May 3, 2019 and 35 facilitated public engagement sessions across Yukon from September to December 2019 in conjunction with an online survey.  Two focus group sessions were held in November 2020, with participants in the creative and cultural industries to review the draft strategy and proposed actions prior to public engagement.

This marks the start of a territory-wide immunization campaign that will be the most comprehensive vaccine program ever delivered in Yukon. Agnes Mills, age 84, is a resident at Whistle Bend Place and was the first to receive the vaccine. Mills is a Vuntut Gwitchin Elder from Old Crow. Mills was inducted into the Order of Yukon last month for her lifelong work to advance the rights of Indigenous people. The second recipient was another resident, Mary Merchant, age 103. Merchant was born in Scotland and survived the influenza pandemic of 1918 to 1920. She moved to Yukon in 1995 and has loved her life here ever since. Merchant trained as a nurse and is strongly supportive of vaccinations. She has continued her role as a nurse to this day cautioning us to social distance and follow the public health directives. The third vaccine went to Jun Carpina, a domestic aide who works in the home. Carpina has worked there since the home opened in 2017. Carpina has lived in Yukon for 14 years; originally, he is from the Philippines. Over the next few weeks, the vaccine will continue to roll out to priority populations as directed by Yukon’s COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy.            Today is a day filled with hope for our territory. The first Yukoners to receive the vaccine will be our most vulnerable to COVID-19 and those who care for them. In the coming weeks and months, all adult Yukoners will have the opportunity to receive the vaccine and help bring us one step closer to ending the pandemic. Everyone who receives the vaccine is choosing to protect themselves and everyone around them.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Throughout the pandemic, we have asked Yukoners to make choices to protect themselves and others from COVID-19. The best thing we can do now is to choose to vaccinate when it is our turn. This vaccine will save lives and will protect our most vulnerable. Over time, it will allow us to return to a normal life, but now is not the time to let our guard down. Stay vigilant, continue to practice the Safe 6 plus 1, and get ready to roll up your sleeve.       Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            When I was 13, I was in a residential school and there was a tuberculosis epidemic. I caught it and was in the hospital for three years. I never fully recovered and have been unwell all my life. I got the vaccine today because I am worried about what a COVID-19 infection would do to me. I am almost 85 years old and want to continue my life – to be here for my family, my children and my grandchildren. I care for mankind and would like to see us overcome this virus.       Elder Agnes Mills, first Yukoner vaccinated            Quick facts       Yukon received its first shipment of vaccine on December 28, 2020. This shipment included 7,200 doses. Yukon’s COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy will guide vaccinations.  Priority groups after long-term care will include high-risk health care staff and other vulnerable populations.  Yukon is expected to receive enough doses of the Moderna vaccine to vaccinate 75 per cent of the adult population by the end of March.

Several new pieces of legislation received assent that focus on investing in economic and social supports for Yukoners impacted by COVID-19, protecting and providing support to Yukoners, strengthening Yukon’s waste reduction efforts, and improving Yukon’s democratic processes. The Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Protection Act bans conversion therapy in Yukon, supporting the government’s commitment to inclusion for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit plus Yukoners (LGBTQ2S+). Amendments to the Employment Standards Act will provide access to paid and unpaid leave for victims of domestic or sexualized violence in Yukon. The new leave provisions also extend to employees if their child, a person they care for or close friend is a victim of domestic or sexualized violence. Amendments to the Environment Act allow for a ban on single use products and packaging in Yukon. Amendments to the Elections Act established fixed dates for territorial elections. Territorial elections will occur on the first Monday in November every four years, starting on November 3, 2025. Amendments to the Land Titles Act support the registry of Settlement Land by First Nations governments. This innovative Act is part of the Government of Yukon’s broader effort to modernize the land titles system to meet the needs of all Yukoners. The Second Appropriation Act 2020–21 includes an increase of $95.9 million in Operations & Maintenance (O&M) gross spending, with an offsetting increase of $58 million in O&M recoveries. The additional spending provides economic and social supports as well as expanded health services for Yukoners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also includes funding to begin implementing the Putting People First plan for health and social care. A motion to establish an all-party committee to review Yukon’s Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) passed during the fall sitting. The committee, which includes a representative from each of the three parties in the Legislative Assembly, will consider and identify options for modernizing CEMA, as well as make recommendations on possible amendments to the Act. The committee will submit a report to the Legislative Assembly on its findings and recommendations by August 31, 2021. The fall sitting also saw a record number of witnesses appear before the Legislative Assembly including:  members of the Independent Expert Panel that prepared Putting People First, the final report of Yukon’s comprehensive review of health and social programs and services; Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health; the Interim President and Chair of the Board of Governors of Yukon University; the Chair and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board; the Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Yukon Hospital Corporation; the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Yukon Energy Corporation; and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Yukon Development Corporation.             As we continue to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic, our government remains focused on protecting Yukoners and supporting them through these challenging times. This fall we passed budget measures focused on social and economic supports and health care services for Yukoners in response to COVID-19. We are also pleased to pass new laws introducing paid leave for those experiencing domestic violence, strengthening Yukon’s waste reduction efforts, supporting and protecting LGBTQ2S+ Yukoners, and introducing fixed election dates for territorial elections.

This tiny wolf pup, named “Zhùr”, which means “wolf” in the Hän language, is said to be from the ice age. Results from a scientific study have now been published in Current Biology, identifying this mummified Pleistocene gray wolf pup, Canis lupus, from the Yukon Territory. This study’s scientific team was led by Dr. Julie Meachen, a palaeontologist from Des Moines University, and Dr. Grant Zazula, a Yukon palaeontologist. Important classifications within the study are: the age of the wolf pup, how long it lived, its diet and its genetic relations to other ancient wolves from the ice age period.  	The scientific team worked with the Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in to highlight the cultural importance of wolves and other ice age mammals within their community. Zhùr is on display at the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre.  	To learn more about the research and the cultural significance of Zhùr, the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre will be hosting a panel discussion with scientists and representatives from the Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in today at 1 p.m. on the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre Facebook page.            Yukoners take great pride in the amazing ice age remains that are found in the permafrost, like Zhùr the ancient ice age wolf. This ancient being was also brought to life through the cultural knowledge of the Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in who share a deep connection with this wolf from their ancient past.       Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie McLean            Blending traditional knowledge with western scientific methods guarantees a magnified understanding of our home and the species who shared this land with our ancestors and ourselves today. We are pleased to be at the leading edge of the movement to incorporate traditional knowledge into scientific research and pleased that Zhùr has reached out to us from our ancestors to teach us more about our environment from long ago.      Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in Chief Roberta Joseph            Mummified remains of ancient animals in North America are incredibly rare. Studying this complete wolf pup allows us to reconstruct how this wolf lived during the ice age in ways that would not be possible by looking at fossil bones alone.       Yukon palaeontologist Grant Zazula            Quick facts       The Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre Facebook page will be hosting the panel discussion today at 1 p.m.  Zhùr was found in July 2016 at Last Chance Creek just outside Dawson, Yukon by miner Neil Loveless. The mummified wolf pup is now on display at the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre which is open Saturdays and Sundays from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m.  Zhùr is the best preserved and most complete mummy of an ancient wolf found to date.

The strategy outlines the government’s vision and goals to develop and manage scientific knowledge in Yukon while establishing a long-term approach to develop and invest in science in order to support evidence-based decision making. The goals of the strategy support best practices in:  collecting; gathering; communicating; and storing scientific knowledge.  A baseline assessment report was developed by Qatalyst Research Group based on the written and verbal feedback of over 200 internal and external respondents who provided input through surveys, interviews and focus groups.  This baseline evaluation provides information on how the Government of Yukon conducts science, facilitates the advancement of science in Yukon and applies information to evidence-based decision making. It establishes a basis to measure progress toward the goals of the Science Strategy when the full evaluation is completed in 2024–25.    The results highlight a number of strengths and areas of improvement within the Government of Yukon. This includes recognition of the government’s increased emphasis on the importance of evidence-based decision making, as well as identification of gaps in data and information management and sharing. A summary of the key findings of the baseline evaluation, as well as a report describing the results in detail, are available on Open Data.            The Government of Yukon is pleased to release the Baseline Science Assessment Report on the Yukon Science Strategy. We believe science should be relevant, timely and accessible in order to support evidence-based decision-making throughout Yukon. We look forward to reporting on our progress to Yukoners in the coming years.      Premier Silver            Quick facts       The full evaluation is scheduled to be completed in 2024–25. That report will assess progress made against the baseline evaluation results.  The strategy marks the first all-of-government effort to provide strategic direction for science activity in Yukon.  The long-term vision supports the active pursuit, gathering and storage of scientific knowledge so it can be easily retrieved, transferred, shared and used to support evidence-based decision-making.  An independent evaluation of the baseline state of science and related activities in the Government of Yukon was ordered in the fall of 2018.

After a review of existing bus routes and ridership from the first half of the school year, adjustments are also being made to optimize the number of students who can ride the school bus. Bus routes will be updated on Yukon.ca and additional families who are able to be accommodated will be notified by email with their bus number by Wednesday, December 23, 2020. Families of students already riding the bus will be notified if there are any changes to their bus number. Updated bus routes will take effect starting Monday, January 4, 2021, when students return to school. Minor adjustments, such as changes to pick-up and drop-off times, are being made to some routes. All families using the bus should check the school bus schedule webpage on Yukon.ca before returning to school in January for the most current routes and stop times. Families should continue to use the school bus stop closest to their home. To support additional ridership on school buses, the health and safety guidelines for school bus operations  have been updated by Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. Starting January 4, all students age five years and older will be required to wear a non-medical mask while riding the school bus.            The health and safety of students and staff is our first priority and we have been working hard to safely accommodate additional students on a school bus. To support more families to safely get to and from school, we have invested in three new school buses and have made some adjustments to our routes to accommodate as many students on our school buses as possible. These changes are designed to help families and will begin as school resumes in January.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            I am pleased to say that as of January 4, 2020, many additional students will be assigned seats on the school bus. To add an extra layer of safety, we will require all students aged five and older to wear non-medical masks while on a school bus. I hope this news will start the New Year on a positive note as students return from the holiday break.

Highlights of the plan include:  increased education and outreach with residents, non-residents and First Nation citizens on live release practices for fish and the need for selective harvest tools for fish management; expanded efforts to reach out to communities on caribou recovery; development of a community strategy to address grizzly bear concerns and human/bear relationships; coordinated action to address the impacts of recreational user groups and access on wildlife; and assigning a dedicated a conservation officer to service the Carcross and Tagish areas.  The plan honours the direction from the Carcross/Tagish Final Agreement, builds on previous work and includes new ideas brought forward by the community. Within the plan, all things are considered cumulatively and holistically, recognizing that everything is inter-connected.            This work plan reflects a collaborative approach to the management of wild species and their habitats in the Carcross/Tagish Traditional Territory. We are pleased to work with the Carcross/Tagish First Nation and the Carcross/Tagish Renewable Resources Council on this important initiatve. We look forward to working together on priorities outlined in the plan, including the establishing a dedicated a conservation officer for the Carcross and Tagish areas.

290,2020-12-15,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/statement-minister-frost-recent-announcement-about-delivery-moderna-vaccine-territories,Government Website,Statement from Minister Frost on recent announcement about the delivery of Moderna vaccine to the territories ,"           Published 15/12/2020        Minister Frost released the following statement: ""We are happy to hear that the Moderna vaccine is closer to approvals and that it could arrive in Yukon as early as the end of December. We will continue to work with our federal colleagues on the delivery logistics so that as soon as the vaccine is approved and ready for distribution, we can begin rolling it out to Yukoners. We have already received three freezers to help with the storage of the vaccine. We believe the most logical course of action is to send Yukon’s vaccines in one large delivery so that roll out can begin and continue as quickly as possible. We have reassurance that Yukon will receive enough doses to vaccinate 75 per cent of the population in early 2021. That, according to projections from our health team, means every Yukon adult who wants it will be able to be vaccinated in early 2021. As the federal government determines the final details, we will continue to work on the specifics of vaccine delivery in Yukon as identified in our vaccine strategy. We will begin by making the vaccine available to the most vulnerable Yukoners and those who are at the highest risk. We have identified priority populations in Yukon including but not limited to:  residents and staff of long-term care homes, and shelters; health care workers; people over 80 years of age; and Yukoners living in rural and remote communities.  I encourage all Yukoners to continue to practise the Safe 6 and wear a mask. Yukoners should also keep in mind that the vaccine will be a turning point, but it will not be the end of COVID-19 safety precautions. We must all work together to keep each other safe.""

296,2020-12-11,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/new-yukon-first-nations-procurement-policy-unveiled-yukon-forum,Government Website,New Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy unveiled at Yukon Forum ,"           Published 11/12/2020         Joint news release with the Council of Yukon First Nations and Yukon First Nations governments Today, Premier Sandy Silver, Council of Yukon First Nations’ Grand Chief Peter Johnston and the Yukon First Nations Chiefs endorsed the Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy at the Yukon Forum. The policy, which was developed through an innovative, collaborative process involving representatives of the territorial and Yukon First Nations governments, was endorsed by the Yukon Forum leaders. The Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy will strengthen outcomes for Yukon First Nations people and businesses by providing opportunities for Yukon First Nations governments, businesses and people to participate in territorial procurements. The new policy also encourages Yukon businesses to bid on government contracts in partnership with Yukon First Nations businesses. During the one-day meeting, the leaders also discussed a range of issues, including the Yukon Strategy on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-spirit+ people, pandemic management, the Mineral Development Strategy, the territory’s forestry industry and the recent Yukon Days meetings with the federal government.            The Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy and the collaborative partnership that led to it is an important step forward in our journey towards reconciliation. It will bring business opportunities for Yukon First Nations and advance economic self-sufficiency.      Premier Sandy Silver             We committed to the Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy during the 2016 election and I am very happy to see it come to completion. It is an important policy that moves the government’s procurement policy in a more inclusive direction for all Yukoners.      Minister Richard Mostyn            The Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy will ensure that Yukon First Nations businesses benefit from improved access to opportunities and is a great example of meaningful collaboration between Yukon First Nations and Government of Yukon through the Yukon Forum Joint Action Plan.      Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston            Quick facts       The Yukon Forum is a meeting of the political leaders of the Government of Yukon, Yukon First Nations governments and the Council of Yukon First Nations.  The Yukon Forum meets four times a year.  This is the 16th Yukon Forum meeting since signing the Working Together Declaration in January 2017.          Backgrounder   Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy  The Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy (YFNPP) was unveiled at the December 11, 2020 Yukon Forum by the Government of Yukon, Yukon First Nations and Council of Yukon First Nations leaders. The policy was developed through an innovative, collaborative approach involving the representatives of the Yukon government and Yukon First Nations. How will this new policy benefit Yukon First Nations? Increased hiring  Points will be allocated to tenders that involve bids committing to hire Yukon First Nations people to work on territorial procurement projects.   Worker development plans will connect Yukon First Nations people to training, skills development and employment opportunities associated with territorial procurements.  More community engagement  Community Development Agreements will provide direct benefits and opportunities to Yukon First Nation people, businesses and communities for projects within a Yukon First Nation’s traditional territory. Annual community contract forecasts will be shared with Yukon First Nations communities. Yukon will meet with each Yukon First Nation government annually to review Yukon’s capital spending plans for capital projects.  Opportunities for Yukon First Nation Businesses  New procurement tools will increase the number of territorial procurements awarded to Yukon First Nations businesses or bids involving Yukon First Nations businesses. A Yukon First Nations Business Registry will list Yukon First Nation-owned businesses. The Registry will contain information on the goods and services offered by Yukon First Nations businesses, and will be accessible to Yukon government procurement authorities. Bid value reductions will be available to bidders and sub-contractors based on their percentage of Yukon First Nation ownership. This will increase the competitiveness of bids submitted by Yukon businesses and Yukon First Nations businesses.  Greater accountability  A monitor and review committee will be established to ensure policy objectives are being met and improvements to policy effectiveness are being made. Contractor performance will be assessed to determine the extent to which contractors meet contract obligations related to the Yukon First Nations participation measures. Yukon government will aim for more Yukon First Nations representation in the Impartial Review Authority tasked with hearing complaints related to procurement processes.  What defines a Yukon First Nation business? A Yukon First Nation Business meets one of the following criteria: (i) a corporation or not-for-profit corporation where one or more Yukon First Nations is the direct or beneficial owner of 100 per cent of the shares of the corporation; (ii) a sole proprietorship owned by a Yukon First Nation Person; (iii) a partnership or limited partnership where at least 50 per cent of the partnership is owned by a Yukon First Nation Person or an organization described in (a) or (b); (iv) a corporation with at least 51 per cent of the corporation’s voting shares owned by a Yukon First Nation Person or an organization described in (a) or (b); or (v) a not-for-profit organization in good standing under the Societies Act with at least 51 percent of its membership comprised of Yukon First Nations people. A sole proprietorship owned by a non-Yukon First Nation Person, which supports a Yukon First Nation spouse or common law partner, and/or a Yukon First Nation family, may qualify as a Yukon First Nation Business. The Government will engage the relevant Yukon First Nation government during its review. Where will the Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy be located? The General Administration Manual (GAM) 2.6 is Yukon government’s procurement policy. Implemented on April 1, 2019, this policy sets out how Yukon government procures goods and services from individuals and businesses. The new YFNPP is a sub-section of this policy that will fall under the government’s general procurement policy GAM 2.6. When will the Yukon First Nations Procurement Policy come into effect? Implementation will be phased to ensure Yukon First Nations, Yukon businesses and Government of Yukon employees are well-versed in the policy, and that all required tools and templates to implement and operationalize the policy are readily available in order to ensure a successful transition. The Government of Yukon is aiming for and working towards a February 22, 2021 implementation date, and planning for certain provisions (i.e. bid value reductions, set asides, workplace development plans, community development agreements, business registry and invitational tenders) to come into effect on April 26, 2021.

The strategy outlines Yukon’s plan to safely and efficiently deliver COVID-19 vaccines across the territory. All eligible, adult Yukoners who want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine will have access to one, at no cost, in early 2021. No vaccine is currently approved for children or recommended for pregnant people. Yukon will be receiving enough vaccine to immunize 75 per cent of the eligible adult population in the first quarter of 2021. This allocation recognizes Yukon’s significant Indigenous populations and remote communities. If more Yukoners choose to immunize, additional vaccine doses will be available in the second quarter of 2021. Safe and effective vaccines will reduce the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 and associated illnesses and deaths. Over time, widespread immunization will allow Yukoners to live with fewer restrictions as outlined in A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions.            Since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in March 2020, developing safe and effective vaccines to reduce the transmission of the virus has been a global priority. As a result of tremendous efforts from many Yukoners across the territory and in cooperation with our federal, provincial and territorial colleagues, Yukon is ready to safely and efficiently deliver COVID-19 vaccines across the territory.      Premier Sandy Silver             Over the course of the pandemic, Yukoners have come together to protect our territory from COVID-19. Now, it’s very important that Yukoners choose to vaccinate. It’s the best thing we can do to protect ourselves and our loved ones. Over time, widespread immunization will allow us to return to a life without COVID-19 restrictions.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Pending final regulatory approval, Canada’s three territories will be receiving the Moderna vaccine.  Health Canada has a robust system to ensure vaccines are safe and effective. As with any other vaccine, decisions about COVID-19 vaccines in Canada are based on science, independent regulatory review and the advice of experts, including the National Advisory Committee on Immunization.  High-risk populations outlined in national guidance may receive vaccines first. These priority groups may include long-term care residents and staff, health care providers and rural and remote communities.

The state of emergency has facilitated the necessary speed and flexibility that has been central to the Government of Yukon’s response to COVID-19, including putting in place a number of ministerial orders that support the health, safety and economic wellbeing of Yukoners. Without the state of emergency, these ministerial orders would expire. The Government of Yukon regularly evaluates the need for the state of emergency and ministerial orders issued under the Civil Emergency Measures Act and may repeal any that are no longer necessary to the current pandemic situation.            As long as the state of emergency is active, the Government of Yukon can adapt and react quickly to the impacts of the pandemic. However, it is important to note that extending the state of emergency does not indicate any change in the risk of COVID-19 to Yukoners. It is equally important that Yukoners continue to diligently practice the Safe 6 plus 1. We have put crucial measures in place under the Civil Emergency Measures Act, and we know that Yukoners are ready and willing to protect themselves and their communities.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker             Quick facts       The extension of the state of emergency under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) for 90 days started on December 7, 2020.  Following the extension to the state of emergency, the Civil Emergency Measures School Council Elections (COVID-19) Order will be repealed, and the Civil Emergency Measures Social Assistance Regulation Override (COVID-19) Order is being repealed and replaced.  A full list of the orders and legislative changes made under the Civil Emergency Measures Act can be found on https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/latest-updates-covid-19/legislation-changes-covid-19   While Yukoners wait for an effective treatment or vaccine, public health measures will remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.  All Yukoners can continue do their part in ensuring the health and safety of their family members, neighbours, and communities by practicing the Safe 6 plus 1.

The event will be shared with Yukoners online through a livestreamed event and signatories, partners and contributors will attend virtually and in person to sign the 2020 MMIWG2S+ Declaration in support of the strategy. A press conference will immediately follow the conclusion of this event. The document will be available online on Thursday, December 10.            We are incredibly proud to release the Yukon MMIWG2S+ Strategy that will guide our work for the future. Thank you to Yukon’s MMIWG2S+ families and survivors who have always been at the heart of our work. Without you, none of this would be possible. I look forward to working with partners and contributors to implement this strategy.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie McLean            The Yukon MMIWG2S+ Strategy is the result of effort and commitment from many groups, individuals and family members. I am proud of the work that has been done so far, but I know that this is a starting point, and many more of us must now come together to carry out the work of putting this plan into action. A whole of Yukon approach includes all governments, partners and contributors joining in efforts to change the story for MMIWG2S+.      Kwanlin Dün First Nation Chief Doris Bill            This strategy was created with the family members of Yukon’s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-spirit+ people at the forefront and they remain at the heart of this work as we move forward, together.

In response to the Final Report, the Yukon Advisory Committee (YAC) on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-spirit+ people, (MMIWG2S+) identified Yukon priority actions grouped under four paths to develop the Yukon Strategy on MMIWG2S+.  The Yukon Advisory Committee (YAC) was created in the spring of 2015 to guide and support the first Yukon Regional Roundtable on MMIWG2S+ and to connect the work of the National Inquiry in Yukon to families of MMIWG2S+, and Indigenous survivors, experts, and communities.  The Yukon Advisory Committee (YAC) is Co-Chaired by the Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie McLean, Chief of the Kwanlin Dün First Nation Doris Bill and Liard Aboriginal Women’s Society Executive Director Ann Maje Raider.

The Government of Yukon will cover the cost of the medication, known as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication. The PrEP medication will be available to people at-risk of contracting HIV. The medication is in a pill format, and taken daily. An individual must be confirmed to be HIV negative before beginning the medication. The Public Health Agency of Canada estimates there are more than 63,000 Canadians living with HIV and up to 14 per cent of people living with HIV are unaware that they are infected.            Providing coverage for this medication will ensure at-risk Yukoners have access to this important preventative drug. We know HIV is more prevalent in vulnerable populations, and these populations often don’t have coverage through other means. It is important to ensure Yukoners who need access to this medication can receive it.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       The PrEP medication lowers the chance of individuals getting HIV by up to 90 per cent.  People must be tested for HIV before starting the medication and at least every three months while taking the medication.  Coverage will begin mid-January 2021.  Yukoners can receive the prescription from their regular health care provider, and receive the medication and renewals through the Sexual Health Clinic or their community health centre.

310,2020-12-04,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/harvest-management-plan-fortymile-caribou-signed,Government Website,Harvest management plan for Fortymile caribou signed,"           Published 04/12/2020         This is a joint release with Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in. Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in and the Government of Yukon have signed the Fortymile caribou harvest management plan. The harvest management plan will help guide licensed and subsistence harvest and overall management of the herd. It outlines three main goals for the Fortymile caribou herd:  promote a robust, sustainable population that will maximize herd use of habitats within historic Yukon ranges; identify a phased approach to implementing harvest given the long history of not harvesting this herd; and increase knowledge and use of the herd through education and engagement.  Years of technical and local input supported the herd’s recovery and development of this management plan, led by both governments, the Dawson District Renewable Resources Council and the Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board. This plan was developed in the spirit of wildlife co-management and honors the rights and responsibilities of both parties under the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Final Agreement. Through this plan, the parties worked together to uphold the principles of respect for each other and the process, for different ways of doing things, for the sacrifices made to get here and for respect for the caribou.            We are pleased to sign this harvest management plan with Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in. Our governments have been working collaboratively since 2013 to develop this plan, building on the last 25 years of recovery efforts. The harvest management plan will help guide licensed and subsistence harvest and management of the herd moving forward. We are committed to continuing our work with partners to monitor the herd and ensure sustainable harvests into the future.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            This plan is long overdue and we’re pleased to finally see it come to life. It provides for the harvest management of the herd on this side of the Canada-U.S. border and is a tool which allows our governments to make informed decisions on harvest and habitat based on the herd’s health and population and scientific and traditional knowledge.      Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Chief Roberta Joseph            The community of Dawson has played an integral role in the Fortymile caribou herd’s recovery and now its management. The Dawson District Renewable Resource Council is proud to be a partner with Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, Environment Yukon and the Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board in addressing the many challenges facing this herd as we move forward.      Dawson District Renewable Resources Council            Quick facts       The Government of Yukon, Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, the Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board and the Dawson Renewable Resources Council have worked closely with Alaska to recover the Fortymile caribou herd for 25 years. The herd has now recovered to a population that allows for sustainable, managed harvest that is in line with long-term conservation efforts.  The Government of Yukon opened three licensed harvest on Fortymile caribou in 2020, from January to March, from August to September, and a threshold hunt that opened December 1, 2020. Before this, the last licenced harvest on Fortymile caribou was in 1994.  While the Fortymile caribou herd has recovered from a low of 6,500 animals to an estimated 84,000 animals. Continued, long-term monitoring is critical to identify indictors that will guide future harvest management decisions by all parties.

We clarified that:  the Order applies to everyone in Yukon, not just Yukon residents:  people can remove their masks when they're seated at a restaurant or bar table rather than having to be consuming food or drink; and people who are providing as well as receiving personal or health care services can remove their masks if required.  We've also clarified the definition of a mask by removing a reference to face coverings.  Effective today, the use of masks is mandatory in all indoor public spaces in Yukon. The mandate on masks authorized by a Ministerial Order under the Civil Emergency Measures Act ensures a heightened public health response to COVID-19. Masks are now required to be worn by everyone five years and older in most indoor public spaces. These include:  shopping centres and retail businesses such as grocery stores, pharmacies and clothing stores; service businesses; locations that provide personal services or health care provider services; restaurants, bars and other places selling food or drink; places of public worship or a faith gathering; places for sports, fitness and dance activities; places where non-profit organizations provide goods or services to the public; movie theatres, art centres, concert halls, billiard halls, museums and libraries; conference centres, community centres and community halls; indoor common areas of: 		 office buildings; government buildings (other than a school); multi-unit residential buildings; hospitals; hotels, bed and breakfasts and rental cabins; and Yukon university campuses.   entrances of daycare centres and day homes; and on public transportation, in taxis, shuttles or other vehicles for hire.  Schools are not considered a public space. However, school staff and students age 10 and older are required to wear a non-medical mask on the school bus and in school common areas. The Government of Yukon encourages individuals, businesses and organizations to abide by the new mask Order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in Yukon. For the purposes of this Order, a mask is defined as a medical or non-medical mask that covers the mouth and nose. When in an indoor space, masks may be temporarily removed if people are seated at a table in a restaurant or bar, participating in a sport or fitness activity, or providing or receiving personal or health care services that require the mask to be removed.  	Anyone without a mask in an indoor space or who refuses to comply with the direction of an enforcement officer, including refusing to leave a public space where masks are required or engage in abusive or belligerent behaviour, may be subject to a $500 fine.            By implementing this mask mandate, we are asking Yukoners to do the right thing. The simple act of wearing a mask in all indoor public spaces means we are protecting the health and safety of our families, our communities and the most vulnerable in our territory. Please continue to practise the Safe 6and mask up.      Premier Sandy Silver            Quick facts       Non-medical masks can be homemade or commercially bought. Three layers is recommended but two layers is effective. Face shields will not be considered a substitute for a non-medical mask. People who are unable to wear a mask due to psychological, behavioural or other pre-existing health conditions will be exempt from wearing a mask.

To help ensure visitor-dependent businesses survive through winter 2020–21, $1 million is available through the Tourism Non-Accommodation Sector Supplement. Yukon tourism operators and food and beverage businesses that rely on visitors for at least 60 per cent of their revenues and have maximized their eligibility in the Yukon Business Relief Program and CanNor’s Northern Business Relief Fund will be able to apply for support to break even. A total of $300,000 is allocated for the Culture and Tourism Non-Profit Sector Supplement to provide support to culture and tourism non-profit organizations who have suffered revenue losses related to declines in tourism visitation. Organizations projecting year-end deficits in excess of 10 per cent of their overall operating budget will be eligible to apply. This program is to be administered by a third party organization.   Both of these relief programs are based on needs assessments and stem from information gathered through surveying the tourism and the non-profit sectors and through engaging with industry partners. The tourism sector has sustained significant financial losses following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic.            The Tourism sector continues to be hit hard by the impacts of COVID-19 and the closure of the BC-Territory bubble is a reminder that the pandemic is not over yet. Our government recognizes that ongoing relief supports are essential and our priority is to ensure Yukon businesses and organizations survive and are in a position to rebound when the time is right. We will continue to work with stakeholders, Yukon First Nations governments, communities, the Government of Canada and other partners in a concerted effort to support this sector.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie McLean            Quick facts       The relief supports are elements of a broader funding package of up to $15 million over three years for the Yukon tourism industry.

Today, the Government of Canada and the Government of Yukon announced a research program that focusses on gathering the unique information needed to support Yukon’s strategic recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program is requesting expressions of interest for research projects to support the territory’s recovery from the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic.  The goal of the program is to fund research that will increase understanding of the social, cultural, environmental, economic and health impacts of COVID-19 and address gaps in research and data specific to Yukon. Through the financial support of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, the Government of Yukon is able to offer a total of $1 million in funding. The research will support the pandemic-related planning and decision-making needs of the Government of Yukon, the Government of Canada, First Nations governments and communities, and other Yukon organizations.            We thank the federal government for their support for the Recovery Research Program, which will help increase our understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 on our communities and contribute to the territory’s recovery. This is a broad fund open to proposals from community organizations, governments, academics and industry. We particularly encourage partnership-based and Indigenous-led research.      Premier Sandy Silver            I want to thank the leadership of the Government of Yukon for implementing innovative solutions to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the health of Canadians and our economy. Supporting this initiative is part of the Government of Canada’s commitment to implementing key partner priorities of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, including Yukon’s priority to support research specific in the North. COVID-19 has exacerbated many pre-existing Northern challenges, including the need for information and data that reflects the specific needs of Northerners to guide decisions. This investment will help improve our understanding of the specific impacts of COVID-19 in Yukon and how best to respond.      Minister of Northern Affairs Dan Vandal            This research initiative will not only inform decision-making in Yukon and solidly reflect Indigenous values and perspectives, but also enhance Yukon’s science and research community by providing local opportunities for researchers to collaborate with decision-makers. The territory’s longer-term strategic recovery from the pandemic requires informed cooperation and partnership that reflect Yukon-specific needs.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell            Quick facts       The application deadline is January 8, 2021.  Each project can receive up to $75,000.   Partnership and collaboration are encouraged for this funding opportunity, both among Yukon organizations as well as with southern researchers or organizations whose expertise and capacity may complement that of a Yukon-based partner.  The COVID-19 Recovery Research Program objectives are to: 	   provide evidence that informs decision-making and planning, and contributes to the broader COVID-19 recovery efforts in Yukon; ensure Indigenous knowledge, values and perspectives, Indigenous knowledge keepers and Indigenous researchers are reflected in the governance of this program and in the funded research projects; strengthen understanding of COVID-19 impacts and recovery pathways for individuals, businesses, governments and communities in Yukon; enhance the capacity of Yukon’s science community by providing opportunities for local researchers, emphasizing the role of Indigenous knowledge keepers and researchers, and attracting outside expertise to Yukon; and increase coordination, networking and partnerships between researchers and decision-makers.   People interested in applying can contact the Office of the Science Advisor at osa@gov.yk.ca for more information and visit Yukon.ca/recovery-research-program-covid-19.   As of November 10, 2020, the Government of Canada has committed close to $2.5 billion to support Indigenous communities and organizations during COVID-19.  In April 2020, the Government of Canada announced $130 million in support for the North and Arctic for health supports, Nutrition North Canada, Harvesters Support Grant, support for businesses and maintaining essential airline services through the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, $685 million has also been announced through the Indigenous Community Support Fund, which helps Indigenous communities and organizations prevent, prepare and respond to COVID-19.

Yukoners need recreational facilities that are accessible, efficient and environmentally responsible. Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development Maryam Monsef, and on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna, and Minister of Community Services for the Government of Yukon John Streicker, announced funding for recreational infrastructure at the Mount Sima ski hill in Whitehorse. The Mt. Sima pumphouse and electrification project will improve the ski hill’s electricity and snowmaking capacity. The ski hill’s upgrades include new electrical, pumping and stream flow control measures, as well as converting snow-making away from reliance on diesel power. These upgrades will facilitate snow-making opportunities during the low-snow parts of the season, and protect natural surroundings, including Sima Creek. The installation of LED lighting on the ski hill will help build increased capacity for training and special events on the ski hill. The Government of Canada is investing over $3.7 million in this project through the Investing in Canada plan through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS) and the Community, Culture and Recreation Infrastructure Stream (CCRIS). The Government of Yukon is providing more than $1.4 million.            Mt. Sima is a popular winter destination for all Yukoners, including indigenous and youth groups who travel from outside the Whitehorse area to enjoy skiing and snowboarding activities. This funding will improve the operations of this valued facility, which serves as an important winter activity and skill development venue for Yukon residents of all ages.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister Rural Economic Development Maryam Monsef            It’s more important than ever that Canadians have the opportunity to get outside to stay healthy and active while protecting our natural winter environment. The Government of Canada is investing more than $3.7 million in better winter sports infrastructure for Yukon skiers and snowboarders, including upgrades to electrical and pumping systems, improved snow-making operations and eco-friendly lighting on Mt. Sima. Canada’s infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across the country, and builds cleaner, more inclusive communities.      Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna            Mount Sima has recently emerged as a destination training facility for elite Canadian athletes, including Olympic gold medalists. These upgrades to the electricity and snowmaking capacity will allow Mount Sima to provide more training and special events while reducing their dependency on diesel. Our government is committed to supporting transitions to green energy around the territory and at the same time supporting our local recreation infrastructure. We look forward to seeing Mount Sima continue to offer safe quality outdoor experiences for Yukoners.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       Through the Investing in Canada plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.

Leede Jones Gable has identified Yukon as a potential top-tier mining jurisdiction with significant potential for long-term sustainable investments, commonly referred to as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investments. ESG considerations are non-financial principles used by socially-conscious investors to screen opportunities. An ESG-conscious approach is becoming increasingly important to firms such as Leede Jones Gable when prioritizing investments in the mineral sector. The Government of Yukon recognizes the importance of sustainable investment and development in the mineral sector. By promoting Yukon as a stable investment jurisdiction for mineral development, First Nations governments, communities and families will continue to benefit from investments in the industry. Through various initiatives, the Government of Yukon promotes the territory as a top-tier, investment-ready jurisdiction with significant mineral potential. Leede Jones Gable Inc. is a Canadian investment firm with over $3 billion of investment under management and is represented by approximately 200 brokers.            Our government has focused on modernizing and advancing Yukon’s mineral industry in an environmentally and socially-conscious manner with strong environmental, social and corporate governance considerations. From our strong government-to-government relationships with First Nations and world class mineral deposits, to our strategic investments in resource infrastructure and competitive regulatory regime, Yukon is a leading jurisdiction for mining and investment. We welcome investors, such as Leede Jones Gable, who share our vision of Yukon as a stable, world-class mining jurisdiction.      Minister of Economic Development Ranj Pillai            Environmental, social and governance principles are a major component of responsible investment in all sectors, and the mineral sector is no exception. We see Yukon as well-positioned to be a leading ESG-responsible jurisdiction. We are excited to uncover the untold stories of Yukon’s mining exploration companies to present to our investors.

The Youth Investment Fund provided $89,000 in 2020 for short-term projects allocated in two intakes. The funding is aimed at marginalized youth under 19 years of age who have fewer opportunities or who may experience discrimination.            Young Yukoners will be able to learn new skills and build their confidence by taking part in the experiences and activities offered by the community projects supported by the Youth Investment Fund. By removing barriers and providing healthy, engaging opportunities we can help our youth make positive choices and contribute to their communities.      Premier Sandy Silver            Quick facts       The Youth Investment Fund provides funding every spring and fall to qualifying community groups. Eligible groups can apply for funding between $501 and $5,000. The application deadline for the next round of funding is April 1, 2021.

Lastraw Ranch of Bear Creek, Dawson raised pigs for the food market this past season on already-mined sections of a neighbour’s placer claim. Megan Waterman’s family-owned Lastraw Ranch has been producing eggs, chicken and pork since 2011, but expanded pork production in summer of 2020 using a seasonal lease arranged with assistance through the Government of Yukon’s Agriculture Branch. With access to additional land through this lease, Lastraw Ranch successfully expanded pork production by 38 animals this past summer. Lastraw Ranch used the mobile abattoir for harvest of inspected and certified pork, and the entire harvest was delivered to BonTon & Company for butchering and retail sales, located in Dawson. This is the first time the Government of Yukon has issued a seasonal lease for food production. This new type of arrangement is supported by Yukon’s newly adopted agriculture policy, Cultivating Our Future. This project demonstrates a multi-use, and regenerative use, of previously developed land.            Laststraw Ranch’s use of a seasonal lease to produce pork for local consumption is a great example of innovative land lease arrangements, cross industry cooperation and community support for local agriculture business development. This out of the box thinking about land use has the potential to encourage new entrants to Yukon agricultural production at a low start-up cost. I hope to see more of this kind of creative leasing and land use to encourage more local food production in Yukon in the coming years.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            I’m thankful for the collaboration of our neighboring placer mining family, the assistance of Agriculture Branch’s lands manager Jonathan Lucas and legal counsel Carmen Gustafson for developing the seasonal lease. I think our unconventional approach to land use could potentially open up opportunities for other emerging farmers and bolster local food production in keeping with the goals of the new agriculture policy.      Lastraw Ranch Director Megan Waterman            Quick facts       In 2016 Statistics Canada reported over 41 per cent of all land farmed in Canada was in some form of lease agreement  Lastraw Ranch started in 2011 in Bear Creek Subdivision just outside of Dawson City. Lastraw’s successful production model uses the summer months to grow piglets and chicks to market size requiring only a seasonal facility, and no permanent land title nor structures.

This call for projects includes three streams: one for shovel ready projects in Whitehorse, one for shovel ready projects in communities and one for project concepts. First Nations governments, First Nations Development Corporations, developers, contractors, community organizations and the general public can apply for funding to support projects that will increase affordable housing options in their community. This year, project proponents can receive an increased amount of funding. Shovel ready projects in Whitehorse can receive $60,000 per unit up to $600,000 per project. Shovel ready projects in rural Yukon can receive $90,000 per unit up to $900,000 per project. Project concepts can receive up to $20,000 dollars. Submission forms and program fact sheets are available from the Yukon Housing Corporation and information is available on Yukon.ca. The deadline for project proposals is January 15, 2021, at 4:30 p.m.            Affordable housing is a significant challenge for many Yukoners, and we are working hard to address it. Over the past three years, this program has supported the development of over 350 new homes in Yukon.  With this year’s intake worth $3.6 million, we continue to support private market housing developers with projects that increase the amount of affordable homes for rent and for sale in the territory.      Minister Responsible for Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Projects must include a minimum of four units in Whitehorse or a minimum of one unit in communities and must remain affordable for 20 years.  Projects must increase the amount of affordable housing available for Yukoners and can include new affordable rentals, new rent-to-own options, new home ownership options, or other mixed market approaches.  Additional consideration will be given to projects that aim to meet the needs of seniors, tenants earning less than Yukon Housing Corporation’s household income limits, homeless or youth aged 18 to 25.  This funding can be used with other Yukon Housing Corporation programs such as the Municipal Matching Rental Construction Program, the Developer Build Loan Program and federal funding initiatives.  In past years, the Housing Initiatives Fund has supported over 350 new units in 33 projects in the territory. Of 33 projects, 10 projects are completed, 17 projects are underway and six are preparing to start construction.  In addition to projects ready for construction, the Housing Initiatives Fund also supported 10 project concepts through the last call for projects. The projects that received this funding will continue to develop their project details and may reapply to the Housing Initiatives Fund, or other government funding when they are ready to move forward.

The doors of Centre scolaire secondaire communautaire Paul-Émile Mercier (CSSC Mercier) will open to students on November 13, 2020.   Construction of CSSC Mercier, the new French First Language Secondary School Community Centre in Whitehorse, started in spring 2019 and was completed in September 2020. The new school features modernized, flexible learning spaces for French First Language secondary students, including a gymnasium and other spaces for learning and community use.             This is a major milestone for Yukon’s Francophone community and a testament to the renewed partnership between the Yukon government and the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon. This beautiful new building in Riverdale will contribute to the campus model where communities and cultures can gather, learn and play in a variety of facilities. We look forward to seeing students and community groups benefit from these modern learning and community spaces.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            CSSC Mercier is a great example of our government’s new value-driven procurement process. It creates opportunities for local businesses and improves government spending in the territory. We thank the local contractors for their expertise and work on this fantastic new facility and commend them for completing it ahead of schedule. ​​      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            The entry of our students into CSSC Mercier is a historic and exciting moment for the entire Francophone community and for French First Language education programs in the Yukon. The opening of CSSC Mercier demonstrates the respect accorded by the territorial government to our language rights and the provision of an equivalent infrastructure to our students. We thank the Government of Yukon for its commitment and contribution to building CSSC Mercier.      Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon President Jean-Sébastien Blais             Quick facts       The name of the school and community centre was officially chosen on May 15, 2020. The name was proposed by Vincent Bélanger as part of a competition launched by the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon (CSFY) with the Francophone community.  Centre scolaire secondaire communautaire Paul-Émile Mercier (CSSC Mercier) is one significant outcome as a result of agreements between the Government of Yukon and the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon through a joint settlement committee to resolve issues from the 2009 lawsuit.  The Government of Yukon and the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon have reached an agreement to ensure the three schools on the Riverdale campus work collaboratively to optimize the use of facilities.

As a part of the permitting process there was a two-week window for public comment that closed on November 6, 2020. The Government of Yukon has provided comments, identifying that the mitigations proposed, with respect to Porcupine caribou, are inadequate. The Government of Yukon continues to work with Porcupine caribou management partners - the governments of Canada and the Northwest Territories, Inuvialuit, Gwich’in Tribal Council, Vuntut Gwitchin, Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, and First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun. Minister of Environment Pauline Frost released the following statement: “Development activity in the refuge will impact caribou. Specifically, years of collaborative scientific research demonstrates the importance of the calving, post-calving and summer habitats to the Porcupine caribou herd and the corresponding subsistence and cultural practices of the many communities who rely on this herd. We don’t support the permit as presented. We have provided significant scientific-based comments to the United States’ Bureau of Land Management to help guide necessary mitigations, like seasonal considerations, to help meet minimum standards in supporting development that does not unnecessarily impact Porcupine caribou. We have submitted our concerns into the permitting process and continue to urge the United States government to live up to their international commitments to protect the Porcupine caribou herd and its essential habitat in Alaska.”     Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136 matthew.cameron@gov.yk.ca     News release #:   20-330    Related information:   Arctic National Wildlife Refuge        "

The Government of Yukon will continue engaging with school councils, Yukon First Nations governments and school administration at the three Whitehorse high schools to identify additional supports to ensure students are successful on this schedule. The second survey on learning during COVID-19 will be launched later this November to allow students, parents and school staff to provide their feedback on additional supports they may need. The Music Arts and Drama (MAD) program will move back to the Wood Street Centre as part of ongoing adjustments to school programs to meet learning needs and health and safety guidelines throughout the pandemic.    The MAD program will be hosted in the Black Box Theatre at the Wood Street Centre for the remainder of the school year. F.H. Collins Grade 8 students will remain at the Wood Street Centre in the available classroom spaces. School administration and staff will be sharing updates and more information with parents and students about this move in the coming days. The Wood Street Centre’s operational plan will be revised to reflect the return of MAD students and staff.            While it remains our priority to have as many students as possible in class full time, we must ensure we continue to protect the health and safety of students, staff and our communities. We are fortunate the majority of Yukon students are in school full-time and specialized programs like the MAD program can continue. We will continue to invest in additional supports to make sure all Yukon students are successful this year and look forward to hearing from students, staff and families in our second survey.

The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, November 10, at 9 a.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 23. Twenty-one people have recovered and there is currently one active case. COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre From Monday November 2, to Sunday, November 8, we tested 89 people at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre in Whitehorse. To date, we have tested 4,197 people. The centre will be open on Wednesday, November 11. Updates to school guidelines   The school health and safety guidelines for Grades K to 12 have been updated to reduce the requirement for two-metre distancing between students in the classroom and to make masks mandatory in common areas outside of the classroom. This is intended to provide clarity for all schools.   New travel guidance for southern BC British Columbia's Provincial Health Officer announced new orders this weekend. Yukoners travelling to or from BC will need to follow COVID-19 guidelines and abide by the order while they're in BC. The Government of Yukon is monitoring BC developments and will adjust its guidelines and advice as needed based on the recommendations of Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. Holiday travel planning Yukoners who are hosting family this holiday season will need to prepare to self-isolate if they have visitors from outside BC, the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers not from the NWT, Nunavut and BC need to self-isolate with their household for two weeks after arriving in Yukon. If travellers share a space with other household members who will not be self-isolating, they must stay away from each other (two metres or six feet apart) as much as possible. Use a separate bathroom if you can, and avoid sharing household items. New Civil Emergency Measures Act charges One charge was laid on November 5 for failure to transit through Yukon.

If required, a longer-term of up to 15 unpaid weeks can be taken all at once or in increments with the employer’s consent. Paid short-term leave and unpaid long-term leave will be available after 90 days of employment. Unpaid short-term leave will be available immediately. The leave will be implemented once education and support materials are developed and in place. Stakeholders will be asked to share their expertise and knowledge in developing these materials.             Learning from the expertise and knowledge of support organizations, employers and those with lived experience will be invaluable as we develop the capacity and education materials for this new leave. Providing the right supports for employees and employers will allow victims to access this leave readily and in a way that ensures their confidentiality and dignity is respected.       Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Our government is committed to supporting victims to find the help and healing they deserve. These new leave provisions complement the work we are doing to support victims of sexualized and domestic violence through the Sexualized Assault Response Team and the Yukon Strategy on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit people. Whatever path they choose, supports are available for those who have experienced sexualized and domestic violence.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie McLean            Quick facts       Bill No. 10 provides access to paid and unpaid leave for victims of domestic or sexualized violence working in territorially regulated industries and professions. Yukon’s leave also extends to employees if their child, a person they care for, or close friend is a victim of domestic or sexualized violence.  Input from gender-equality seeking organizations, Indigenous women’s groups, LGBTQ2S+ groups, Yukon’s business community and other stakeholders will inform the implementation of this new leave.  All 10 provinces and the Northwest Territories have enacted some version of leave for domestic violence. Yukon joins the six jurisdictions that also provide leave for sexualized violence. The approaches vary in length of leave provided, and whether it is paid or unpaid.  Rates of gender-based violence in Yukon are three times the national average. Indigenous women and girls are three to four times more likely to experience gender-based violence.  Canadian employers lose $77.9 million annually because of direct and indirect impacts of domestic violence.

The Act bans conversion therapy in Yukon, supporting the government’s commitment to inclusion for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit plus Yukoners (LGBTQ2S+). The Canadian Psychological Association and the Canadian Psychiatric Society have broadly discredited conversion therapy, and the aim of this Act is to protect minors and adults that have a substitute decision maker or guardian appointed from harm associated with the practice. The Act also clarifies that conversion therapy is not an insured service. Yukon is the fourth Canadian province or territory to pass legislation banning or criminalizing conversion therapy.            All Yukoners benefit from a more inclusive society. Banning conversion therapy in Yukon is another step in our journey to ensure our territory is inclusive and free of discrimination. I want to thank Yukon’s strong LGBTQ2S+ community for their advocacy and advice on how we can make Yukon a place where all are welcome. This is not only about protecting Yukoners today, but also protecting the generations to follow us.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie McLean            Quick facts       A ban on conversion therapy is one of the items in the Government of Yukon’s LGBTQ2S+ Action Plan, developed based on engagement with Yukon’s LGBTQ2S+ community.  Conversion therapy qualifies as practices, treatments or services that are provided with the intent of changing a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.  Conversion therapy does not include a range of legitimate medical and psychological practices around coping, social support, identity exploration and development, or gender-affirming surgery and related treatments.  A guardian or substitute decision-maker is someone who has been appointed to manage an adult’s personal affairs.

The second phase of aviation support includes funding from the federal government to address the unique needs of remote communities in the North. Air North will receive up to $5.7 million to continue operating its scheduled service connecting Whitehorse to Vancouver, and connecting Whitehorse to Old Crow and Dawson City. Alkan Air will receive up to $300,000 to continue to provide medevac services across the territory. A further $1.1 million is available to support charter and rotary carriers to support essential service operations. The Government of Yukon is also extending aviation fee waivers until March 31, 2021. This will save the aviation industry approximately $234,000. In total, the fee waiver is saving Yukon air operators more than $1 million. The Government of Yukon provided approximately $3.6 million in phase one federal support to the local aviation industry to provide essential and critical services. This brings the total amount of support funding in the Yukon to over $10 million in 2020.            Aviation is critical to the North, and our government is working with our federal partners to support Yukon’s aviation industry to keep our communities connected. Throughout the pandemic, Yukon’s air carriers have transported essential goods, medical supplies and health care workers to and from the territory. This funding ensures they continue to provide the services Yukoners rely on.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            COVID-19 has created unprecedented and catastrophic challenges for all airlines. Northern Carriers have been particularly hard-hit simply because we are maintaining flight schedules that are not viable at current levels of demand but are required in order to ensure the timely and affordable movement of passengers and cargo and in order to protect northern jobs and Indigenous investment.

This change is necessary because there has been an increase in burbot fishing, and recent population estimates indicate burbot population sizes in our smaller lakes are less than previously thought. In order to ensure burbot fisheries are managed responsibly, the Government of Yukon is reducing catch and possession limits. This will help make sure the resource remains healthy for future generations of Yukon anglers to enjoy.            The Government of Yukon is proud to work in partnership with Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board to put this important regulation change in place. Reducing catch and possession limits for fishing will protect these freshwater species, ensuring the populations remains sustainable now and for future generations.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       As participation rates in the burbot fishery grow, harvest of burbot is increasing.   Population surveys conducted since 2011 indicate smaller population than would be expected for lakes of similar size in Alaska or northern British Columbia, suggesting that our lakes are not as productive.    The change will only apply to lakes that are smaller than 2,500 hectares or for larger lakes where the burbot population was assessed as vulnerable. Currently, the only large lake where the new regulation will apply is Dezadeash Lake.    The limits for all other large lakes will remain at current catch and possession limits. Find a list of lakes and limits here.  This regulation change was made through the Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board regulation change process, with public engagement occurring over the winter of 2019–20.           Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136 matthew.cameron@gov.yk.ca Diana Dryburgh-Moraal 	Communications, Environment 	867-334-9815 diana.dryburgh-moraal@gov.yk.ca      News release #:   20-322    Related information:   See fishing rules and regulations        "

Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. That is why the Government of Canada partnered with the Government of Yukon to provide additional support to hundreds of low-income households across the territory between now and 2027. Today, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Ahmed Hussen, along with Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost, announced the Canada-Yukon Housing benefit, a direct to household benefit program which will help low to moderate income Yukoners in rental housing who cannot afford rent for a home that meets their needs. The program includes $9.1 million of new federal funding, combined with a mix of territorial cost matching, for a total of $18.2 million that will support affordable housing subsidies for Yukoners. The Canada-Yukon Housing Benefit prioritizes households in need and the tenant can continue to receive the benefit if they move to another home within the territory. Depending on their household income and size of family, applicants can receive $200, $400, $600 or $800 per month. Yukoners can apply for the new benefit at Yukon Housing Corporation offices or online at https://yukon.ca/apply-Canada-Yukon-housing-benefit The Canada-Yukon Housing Benefit builds on the Canada-Yukon Bilateral Agreement, announced last year under the National Housing Strategy, which will provide more than $75 million to protect, renew and expand social and community housing, and support Yukon’s priorities related to housing repair, construction, and affordability.            The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home. Long-term, predictable funding for housing has been needed for more than a decade. Today, with the Government of Yukon, we have taken a significant step toward our goal of building strong communities where Yukoners can prosper and thrive, now and for the future.       Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for CMHC Ahmed Hussen            Stable, affordable housing is foundational to the health and wellbeing of all Yukoners. The Canada-Yukon Housing Benefit will help Yukoners afford housing that meets their needs. We are pleased to collaborate with the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation on this new program that supports the goals of the Housing Action Plan for Yukon.      Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost            For the first time in a generation, the federal government is back into affordable housing with our National Housing Strategy. The Canada-Yukon Housing Benefit is a key component in developing an ambitious 10-year plan for the housing sector, and to make real progress for Yukoners. I remain committed to working with all levels of government to ensure that our communities have access to safe, affordable, and stable housing.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell            Quick facts       This program is for Yukon households that make less than $103,070 in gross income per year. This is called the Affordable Household Income Limit.  The amount an eligible household receives through this program will be based on the size of home required for their family size.  Yukoners who are approved for the program will start receiving Canada-Yukon Housing Benefit before December 1, 2020.  The Government of Canada will invest $2 billion in the Canada Housing Benefit across the country, which will be cost-matched by provinces and territories for a total $4-billion investment over eight years, starting in spring 2020. The federal government, and provinces and territories are working together to co-develop 13 housing benefit programs, one for each jurisdiction, that will respond to local housing affordability challenges.  The Government of Canada is currently rolling out its National Housing Strategy (NHS), an ambitious 10-year, $55 billion plan that will create 125,000 new housing units and lift 530,000 families out of housing need, as well as repair and renew more than 300,000 housing units and reduce chronic homelessness by 50 per cent.

359,2020-11-03,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/government-increasing-supports-yukon-seniors-and-elders,Government Website,Government increasing supports for Yukon seniors and Elders,"           Published 03/11/2020        The Government of Yukon is enhancing programs and services for Yukon seniors and Elders, with the goal of supporting them to age in place in their own homes and communities. The Community Day Program, offered at Whistle Bend Place, will be expanded beginning April 1, 2021. Two additional staff will be hired, increasing the daily capacity to 16 clients if it is safe to do so within current safety guidelines. Funding will also be provided to support transportation for individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend the program. The Government of Yukon will continue to invest in Shine a Light on Dementia, a program that provides education and training for caregivers of people with dementia. The program will be offered online, in both French and English, on an ongoing basis. Continuing Care will also begin offering the in-person Dementia 101 information program when permitted as per COVID-19 safety precautions. Beginning in April 2021, a new rural end-of-life support program will provide direct funding to Yukoners in rural communities who have a progressive, life-limiting illness and are at end of life. Up to $10,000 per individual will be available, which can be used to hire local caregivers to provide needed personal supports in their own home. The Government of Yukon is working with Yukon First Nations to develop a Yukon-specific Indigenous cultural safety and humility training program. This program will be made available to all department and Yukon Hospital Corporation employees. Work has also begun on a program that will provide more opportunities for Indigenous residents of long-term care homes to participate in programming that honours and celebrates First Nations history, culture and traditional practices. These additional supports are part of the Government of Yukon’s ongoing response to the Putting People First report and the Aging in Place Action Plan. Putting People First also recommends that the Government of Yukon shift resources away from subsidizing long-term care and toward initiatives that support aging in place. To address that recommendation, fees for residents of Government of Yukon long-term care homes will increase from $35 per day to $40 per day as of January 1, 2021. Residents will also be given the option of paying their rent by way of a pre-authorized debit payment, with the new monthly rate of $1,217. Yukon’s rate for long-term care will remain one of the lowest in Canada.            We are working to ensure that the resources of our health and social system remain focused on providing Yukoners with the supports they need to live independent lives in their own home and community for as long as possible. These initiatives all address recommendations made in Putting People First and the Aging in Place Action Plan, as well as three of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s Calls to Action. This work will also help us build a health and social system and that is culturally safe and responsive to the needs of Indigenous people.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Expanding the Community Day Program directly addresses recommendation 3.10 in the Putting People First report and recommendation 4.2 in the Aging in Place Action Plan.  Providing dementia training for caregivers directly addresses recommendation 3.10 in Putting People First and recommendation 4.1 in the Aging in Place Action Plan.  Expanding palliative and end-of-life care programs and supports directly addresses recommendation 3.9 in Putting People First and recommendation 4.10 in the Aging in Place Action Plan.  Implementing an Indigenous cultural safety and humility training program addresses recommendation 4.1 in Putting People First and Truth and Reconciliation call to action #18.  Expanding programming for Indigenous Yukoners in long-term care addresses recommendation 4.2 in Putting People First and Truth and Reconciliation call to action #22.  Yukon’s fees for long-term care are significantly lower than the Canadian average, which is currently $83 per day. The last increase in long-term care fees in Yukon was in 2013.

There were two intakes this year due to the impacts of COVID-19. The High Performance Athlete Assistance Program offers support to individual Yukon athletes and officials who have demonstrated they are at a high or elite performance level.            Though COVID-19 has temporarily interrupted major sport competitions, we look forward to the day when Yukoners can again compete at these events. This funding will support our territory’s amazing athletes during this time, allowing them to continue their training and skill development and ensuring they are ready for competition when these events return.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       The Yukon High Performance Athlete Assistance Program provides funding for athletes who have demonstrated performance that is beyond the territorial level, with the potential for improvement at the provincial, national or international levels.   Typically, there is only one intake for this program every year, which is announced in June. However, a second intake was introduced in 2020 to give athletes and officials an opportunity to apply for funding once they had a better understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 on their training and competitions.

This is the territory’s 23rd case of COVID-19 infection and is not linked to the Watson Lake cluster. Laboratory results confirmed the positive diagnosis on the night of Wednesday, October 28. Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) staff has completed contact tracing and there is no risk of public exposure. Because they had travelled as well as having a contact history, the person was already self-isolating and is recovering well at home. The new case was identified through contact tracing and is linked to travel-related cases previously reported in Whitehorse. As a reminder, anyone who develops symptoms, regardless of how mild, should self-isolate immediately and arrange for testing. As always, anyone seeking urgent medical care should go to an emergency department and a community health centre.            This newest case serves to underline the importance of thorough contact tracing in controlling COVID-19 transmission in our territory. In Yukon, contact tracing is carried out by Yukon Communicable Disease Control in collaboration with Community Nursing and health care providers throughout the territory.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       In Whitehorse, the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre is open seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.  In Watson Lake and Dawson City, people can get tested at community hospitals.

364,2020-10-29,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/2019-20-public-accounts-released,Government Website,2019–20 Public Accounts released,"           Published 29/10/2020        Today, Premier and Minister of Finance Sandy Silver tabled the 2019–20 Public Accounts in the Legislative Assembly. The 2019–20 Public Accounts have been audited by the Auditor General of Canada and have received an unqualified audit opinion, which indicates that the government’s financial statements are fairly and appropriately presented without any identified exceptions. As anticipated in the 2019–20 Main Estimates, the non-consolidated annual deficit for 2019–20 was $2.9 million based on revenues of $1.446 billion, expenses of $1.450 billion and prior years’ expense recoveries of $1.5 million. On a consolidated basis, including all entities within the Government of Yukon’s control, the annual deficit for 2019–20 was $2.6 million based on revenues of $1.476 billion, expenses of $1.480 billion and prior years’ expense recoveries of $1.6 million. At the end of the fiscal year, non-consolidated net debt was $47.4 million with the government holding financial assets worth $381.6 million and liabilities of $429.0 million. On a consolidated basis, net financial assets were $171.9 million based on financial assets of $667.5 million and liabilities of $495.6 million. The increase in net debt is primarily the result of the government’s continued investment in tangible capital assets, which includes infrastructure like buildings and vehicles. On a consolidated level, Yukon continues to be one of only two Canadian jurisdictions in a net financial asset position.            Despite the impact of COVID-19 late in the fiscal year, Yukon continues to demonstrate strong financial leadership and responsiveness by investing in the future of the territory. The Public Accounts show that the Government of Yukon is closing the gap between the Main Estimates forecast at the beginning of the year and actual spending.      Minister of Finance Sandy Silver            Quick facts       The Public Accounts reports the actual financial results for the prior fiscal year and the financial position at the end of that fiscal year.   The government’s non-consolidated reports do not include the financial results for Yukon University, formerly Yukon College, Yukon Hospital Corporation, Yukon Housing Corporation, Yukon Development Corporation or Yukon Liquor Corporation.  The non-consolidated deficit for 2019–20 of $2.9 million differs only slightly with the budgeted deficit of $5.9 million. The change resulted primarily from higher than estimated revenues of $15.9 million, higher than anticipated expenses of $14.4 million and a recovery of prior years’ expenses of $1.5 million.  The Office of the Auditor General of Canada is responsible for verifying that the consolidated financial statements of a jurisdiction fairly present its financial results in accordance with Canadian public sector accounting standards. The audit is not an opinion on the status of the jurisdiction’s finances.  Yukon received an AA credit rating from Standard and Poor’s in 2020, tied for the second highest rating in Canada.

Make sure devices are ready to show the new Yukon time by installing the latest updates to operating systems and other scheduling software.  	As Yukon moves closer to transitioning into a new permanent time, the government has become aware of an issue with calendars, scheduling and appointments after November 1, 2020.  	If a calendar item was created when a computer or phone was still recognizing Pacific Time, but was scheduled to occur on or after November 1, that item may think it should be on Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8). It will then translate to showing as an hour later than intended when the phone or computer is set to Yukon time (UTC-7). This problem is showing up in Outlook, Google and Apple calendars, and likely will affect other calendars and scheduling systems.  	This has the potential for confusion with business meetings and personal appointments. This may also affect scheduled events for machines and automated systems that are set to operate at a certain time of day. It is important to review calendars and confirm appointments such as flight departure times, medical appointments, work meetings, building automation etc., that occur in the weeks following November 1 to ensure that they remain accurate. The Government of Yukon recommends that Yukoners update their devices and systems as soon as possible. If a device does not show “UTC-7 Yukon” or “Whitehorse” time automatically after updating, it can be manually set to the new time zone. For specific hardware or software issues, contact the appropriate IT specialist or the manufacturer’s customer support.      Quick facts       Yukon’s new regulation on time takes effect on November 1. Yukon is now permanently seven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-7).  On November 1, 2020, Yukon will be on the same time as Alberta, the NWT and northeastern BC. Yukon will be one hour ahead of the rest of BC.  In March 2021, Yukon will be on the same time as all of BC and one hour behind Alberta and the NWT.

These fast-chargers join three others located in Whitehorse and Carcross and are available for public use. The chargers are also part of a study on how electric vehicles operate in a cold climate. Data gathered is helping governments understand how the electric vehicle travel range and charging efficiency vary throughout the year. The lessons learned in this project will be beneficial to all northern regions of Canada. The Government of Canada and the Government of Yukon are contributing a total of $676,500 in funding for the three-year study. Other project partners include Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, Carcross/Tagish First Nation, Yukon University, Northern Vision Development, Yukonstruct and ATCO Electric Yukon. Installing fast chargers for electric vehicles is a Government of Yukon commitment under Our Clean Future: A Yukon strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy. Yukon has gone from three publicly accessible electric vehicle chargers in 2018 to 16 now located throughout the territory.            We are providing greener options for Canadians to drive where they need to go. This is part of how we get to net-zero by 2050.      Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources Seamus O’Regan            These new electric vehicle chargers will make it easier and more affordable for Yukoners to choose zero-emission vehicles, while helping to improve air quality and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell            Under Our Clean Future, the Government of Yukon is investing in green infrastructure and supporting electric technology that cuts climate pollution and remains effective in Yukon’s cold climate. Ultimately, our goal is to install fast-charging stations across Yukon so that by 2027 it is possible to travel between all of Yukon’s road-accessible communities with an electric vehicle, through an electrified transportation network.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Stewardship of Däkeyí (our country), and the land, water and animals, is one of our First Nation’s highest priorities. The new charging station at Da Kų makes it possible for community members and visitors to make good choices to reduce their emissions. We are glad to be a partner on this important study, and to have the first electrical vehicle charger in Dakwäkäda (Haines Junction) located at our cultural centre.      Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Kaaxnox, Dän nätthe äda (Chief Steve Smith)            Quick facts       Natural Resources Canada’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Demonstration program invested $376,500 with the Government of Yukon adding $300,000 in funding.  The new chargers are located in the Army Beach water treatment plant in Marsh Lake and at the Da Kų Culture Centre in Haines Junction. The three fast-chargers installed in 2019 are at the Yukon Visitor Information Centre, the Yukon Center Mall in Whitehorse and at the Carcross/Tagish First Nation Learning Centre in Carcross.  Types of charging stations include: Level 1 is a common household outlet (120 volts) and charges a vehicle overnight; Level 2 is similar to a household outlet for ranges or clothes dryers (240 volts) and charges a vehicle in a few hours; and Level 3 (fast chargers) charges a vehicle in 30 minutes (480 volts).

Yukon’s influenza vaccine will be available starting on Monday, October 19, with the first week aimed at those most vulnerable to complications from influenza. These include Yukon residents with chronic medical conditions, as well as those over 65, pregnant women, and young children. Vaccines will be available for the general public as of Monday, October 26. Due to COVID-19, clinics will be different in order to ensure proper safety precautious are taken. The vaccine is safe and available to everyone over the age of six months free of charge through local health centres in the communities, and the Coast High Country Inn Convention Centre, located at 4051 Fourth Avenue in Whitehorse. In addition, certain pharmacists within Whitehorse will be offering flu shots this year.            This fall and winter, flu viruses and COVID-19 may both spread. It is more important than ever that Yukoners do everything they can to protect themselves and others from all respiratory illnesses, including the flu. We encourage Yukoners to prevent what they can by getting the flu vaccine this year.      Yukon Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley             This year more than ever, we encourage Yukoners to take action by getting their flu shot. The flu shot is free and available to anyone over the age of six months. Getting the flu shot and keeping vaccinations up to date will help reduce the risk of illness that can be caused by seasonal influenza.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Yukon has received its full shipment of injection-style flu vaccine, and flumist, a flu vaccine nasal spray.  Currently, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. Getting the flu shot and keeping vaccinations up to date will reduce your risk of becoming ill.  Individuals over the age of 65 or at risk for pneumococcal infection are encouraged to get the Pneumococcal 23 vaccine if they have not yet received it.  Influenza can cause serious illness and hospitalization among those with chronic conditions.  In healthy individuals, influenza symptoms are generally mild to moderate. In more serious cases, symptoms can include rapid onset of high fever, cough, sore throat, aches, pains and chills.  The vaccine is free and safe and it takes about two weeks for the influenza vaccine to become effective, so the best time to be vaccinated in Yukon is as soon as the vaccine becomes available.  This year we recommend that people wear a non-medical mask while in the flu clinic, but this is not mandatory. People who do not have a mask will still be provided with an influenza vaccine.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, flu clinics will be different this year. For more information on what to expect and how to prepare for this year’s flu clinics visit: https://yukon.ca/en/find-flu-shot-clinic  People who suspect they have the flu should stay home and should call 811 to see if they need to be tested for COVID-19.

Contact tracing has been completed and Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) has been in touch with all contacts. There is no increased risk to the public due to these cases. The new cases are travel-related. The two individuals returned to Whitehorse after travel out of the territory and were self-isolating. They began feeling mild symptoms which were confirmed to be COVID-19. They are currently recovering at home. This serves as a reminder that all people with symptoms, even if mild, should consider COVID-19 as a possibility; use the COVID-19 self-assessment tool and follow the testing advice. The most common way that people experience the COVID-19 infection is with mild symptoms: cough, fever, chills, difficulty breathing or loss of sense of taste or smell. Using the “traffic light” guidance may also help to decide what to do for symptoms that resolve quickly for people who have not travelled. Any person who develops these symptoms regardless of how mild, should self-isolate immediately and arrange for testing when available. Testing is available during normal operating hours of community health centres.

This support program of up to $2.88 million is being added to the Yukon Business Relief Program to help eligible accommodation businesses as they are a critical part of Yukon’s tourism infrastructure. This support is one element of a broader funding package of up to $15 million over three years for the Yukon tourism industry to help the industry deal with the unprecedented impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on global tourism and travel. The relief and recovery package has been developed with the input of the Yukon Tourism Advisory Board, a board of Yukon tourism industry experts appointed to provide strategic advice to the Minister of Tourism and Culture. The Government of Yukon continues to engage with tourism businesses, Yukon First Nations, non-profit organizations and other partners to refine additional relief measures and long-term recovery initiatives to ensure they respond to industry needs in the most effective and efficient way.            The travel restrictions put in place to protect Yukoners and Canadians from the COVID-19 pandemic have had the unintended impact of devastating Yukon’s tourism industry. The investment that I am announcing today, consistent with the guiding principles of the Yukon Tourism Development Strategy, will put necessary relief and recovery supports in place, starting with up to $2.88 million for the accommodation sector. Full recovery of this critical industry for the Yukon economy will take time, but I am committed to ensuring our tourism sector will emerge stronger and more resilient than ever.

We are pleased to be expanding the HPV vaccination program to include all individuals up to their 27th birthday. Expanding the eligibility for this immunization will offer more Yukoners protection from HPV-related cancers caused by HPV.

The projects, designed and developed by, and for, Indigenous women, focus on providing support groups, education workshops, trauma-informed training and building cultural connections. Funding for the projects is provided through the Prevention of Violence against Aboriginal Women Fund (PVAAW). PVAAW was developed to support Indigenous women’s organizations, registered societies and First Nations in recognition that there are disproportionate rates of violence experienced by Indigenous women and girls. Applicants can apply for up to $25,000 for a one-year project or $50,000 for a two-year project. Projects are assessed by an independent adjudication panel comprising Indigenous women.            Our government is proud to be supporting Yukon’s grassroots organizations and First Nation governments in this critical work. We know that the most effective solutions for violence against Indigenous women and girls come from the community and work for the community. By providing safe spaces to build cultural connections and expand opportunities for trauma-informed learning, these projects will help improve the lives of women and girls throughout Yukon.      Minister Responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie Dendys           Backgrounder   Recipients of the 2020–22 Prevention of Violence against Aboriginal Women Fund: Circle of Dreams Women’s Groups - First Nation of Na-Cho Nyak Dun    This two-year project will work with Women in the Community of Mayo to offer weekly Women’s Support groups. Each weekly session will be targeted to building community, strengthening, building connections and empowering women. This group will work to build trust and provide a healthy supportive environment in which they can share, learn and grow. These weekly sessions will offer a venue for community support services to access community members. The program will be run solely by women, citizens and their children. Additional programing includes bi-weekly evening meetings which will offer training and skills development, arts, family outdoor activities, one week on the land, self-defence training, conflict resolution skills, mental health support and various workshops aimed at empowerment. Discussions will include awareness of all variations of abuse, including neglect. Information on counselling and treatment options, as well as cultural healing methods, will be offered with Elders.  Awareness as a Path to Wellness – Selkirk First Nation    This two-year project is offering a two-tier approach to community wellness. Beginning with the Care for the Caregivers, tier one will provide staff with training that will assist in addressing the impacts of vicarious trauma, as well as preparing to provide guidance and support for women in the community who are living with the effects of violence through trauma response training. Tier two will support Selkirk First Nation to work with participants and organizations offering education, training and information sharing. Through eight community workshops and healing circles participants will be able to clearly identify what violence looks like so that women can begin to know when they have been victimized or have witnessed victimization.  Beads and Blessing for Aboriginal Women– Skookum Jim Friendship Centre  This one-year project offers a biweekly women’s group for Women and Youth at risk, who face barriers and/or are victims of violence. This program offers a safe space for participants to talk about these matters and express their feelings and experiences to other women who are and have been in their situation and circumstances. The program will provide food and discuss life skill topics such as healthy eating, healthy relationships, budgeting and planning for life goals. This group is by women, for women, and participants will have the opportunity to be involved in cultural teachings while working alongside Elders.   Cultural Connections Peer Support Project – Whitehorse Aboriginal Women’s Circle (WAWC)  This two-year project is a building on ideas and suggestions that were collected through a series of workshops hosted by WAWC. Women had asked for opportunities to support one another and share their infinite wisdom, traditional roots, cultural values and practices. Cultural connections between women builds resilience and strengthens relationships, which contribute to the capacity to address violence, improve safety, prevent violence and support recovery. The focus of this project is women (over 50 years of age) investing in peer relationships to share cultural knowledge, with the goal of addressing and preventing violence against women and girls. The older generation of Indigenous women have experienced direct and intergenerational effects of residential school and other impacts of colonization which contributes to their lifetime risk of experiencing violence. Women have also learned a lot about how to protect themselves and others. The project is set in the context of reconciliation, self-determination, cultural ways of knowing and being, trauma-informed design, connection to language, cultural identity, kinship systems and capacity building.  This project will support the development and evaluation of a culturally-founded peer support model during the six workshops taking place over the next two years.

Starting January 1, 2021, the medical travel subsidy for patients will double, from $75 per day to $150 per day, for multi-day travel. A new $75 subsidy will also be introduced for same day travel for both patients and escorts. Medical travel to cities such as Prince George, Victoria and Kelowna will also be included in the medical travel subsidy program. Increased options will give patients more flexibility in determining the most appropriate destination to respond to their treatment needs. To reflect the new vision of medical travel, a new care coordination and medical travel unit will be created in 2021–22. The new unit will deliver wraparound support to all Yukoners travelling for medical treatment, including those travelling through other insurance programs such as Non-Insured Health Benefits. Improvements to medical travel support are included in the recommendations of Putting People First, the Government of Yukon’s roadmap to transform Yukon’s health and social services system into a more integrated, collaborative and person-centred system that will better meet the needs of Yukoners.            Our government is committed to reducing the financial strain faced by Yukoners travelling for medical treatment in and out of territory. These changes will make medical travel more affordable and accessible for Yukoners while expanding options for treatment. The new care coordination unit will also ensure that all Yukoners have comprehensive support as they receive the medical treatment they need. These improvements to medical travel supports are part of our efforts to move Yukon toward a more holistic and people-centred health and social services system.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Putting People First is the final report of Yukon’s comprehensive review of health and social program and services.  The current medical travel subsidy has been in place since 2006.  The existing medical travel subsidy for patients will double, from $75 per day to $150 per day for multi-day travel. Approved escorts will be eligible for $75 per day. For medical travel trips that only last a single day, eligible patients and approved escorts are each eligible for $75 for that day.  Local travel subsidies for rural residents living in zone one and two and travelling to Whitehorse will end on December 31, 2020, to allow for more effective program delivery.  The list of destination cities currently limits travel to Vancouver, Calgary or Edmonton.  Travel for medical treatment program is available to help eligible people with the cost of medically necessary transportation. Yukoners are eligible for medical travel benefits if they are residents registered with the Yukon Health Care Insurance Plan and meet the program requirements.

The amendments incorporate best practices and lessons learned from other jurisdictions into Yukon’s societies legislation. For consistency, some related technical amendments are also proposed to the Business Corporations Act and the Cooperative Associations Act. The proposed amendments provide clearer guidance on processes for societies regarding their governance and operations, including:  requirements for up-to-date reporting of directors’ terms of office and their contact information; reporting of remuneration of employee positions in a society, including contractors that are paid a minimum yearly amount, to be set in the regulations, actual names would not be required to be reported;  societies would be able to hold online or teleconference meetings, subject to each society’s bylaws; societies would have an opportunity to adopt modernized model bylaws with options to choose from; notice of upcoming general meetings would be allowed to be sent by email, but only if members provide their email address for this specific reason; and clarification that the prohibition of individuals subject to guardianship orders from being directors would only apply where the guardianship order relates to an individual being incapable of managing legal or financial matters.             These amendments would provide Yukon societies with clearer guidance, reduce red tape, and allow for online and other meeting formats, while also providing for the accountabilities that they have requested. The changes will help societies streamline administration and focus more on providing the quality programs and supports relied on and enjoyed by so many Yukoners.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, October 7, at 11 a.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 3,542 people. COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre From Tuesday, September 29, to Monday, October 5, we tested 108 people at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre (CTAC) in Whitehorse. COVID alert app  We are reviewing the current benefits and limitations of the Government of Canada’s COVID Alert app within the territory and how it is working in other jurisdictions. The app uses Bluetooth to communicate with other devices when in close range. If your phone has been in the same location as a person diagnosed with COVID-19 who uses the app and has uploaded that information, you are anonymously advised of a possible exposure. Yukoners who have downloaded the app and travelled outside Yukon should contact Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) for follow up if they receive an alert on their device. New testing options  A new swish and spit, or gargle, COVID-19 test developed in BC may be used within Yukon in the near future. This test does not require a nasal swab and the gargle option is particularly useful for children. Another tool under review is the Abbott ID NOW test, which is a portable rapid molecular test that can provide results within 15 minutes. This test was approved by Health Canada and Yukon anticipates receiving an allotment of 10 machines. More information on how the machines will be deployed will be provided as analysis proceeds.

Minister of Environment Pauline Frost tabled Bill 14 today in the Yukon Legislative Assembly. The Bill would allow for new rules around how single-use products and packages are made, supplied, distributed and used.  Single-use products, like plastic and paper bags, are harmful to the environment and expensive to deal with when they become waste. In the 2019 Speech from the Throne, the Government of Yukon announced plans to ban on single-use bags.            Single-use packaging is a growing problem, but one we can address by reducing the amount of single-use products we use in the territory.  Banning single-use packages and products will help Yukon align with national and international efforts to reduce waste in our environment and landfills.  	       Minister of Environment Pauline Frost             Quick facts       The low cost of producing and disposing of single-use items has increased the amount of disposable plastic products and packaging that end up in our environment. Only nine per cent of plastic is recycled in Canada.    Plastics that are not recycled, like some single-use bags, are an increasing problem because they end up in our waterways, forests and in the stomachs of wildlife and birds.  Plastic takes thousands of years to break down. Even as it breaks down, plastic in our environment is still hazardous as tiny pieces are often eaten by fish and aquatic life.

395,2020-10-05,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/ban-single-use-products-proposed,Government Website,Ban on single-use products proposed,"           Published 05/10/2020        The Government of Yukon is proposing amendments to the Environment Act to strengthen the territory’s waste reduction efforts by allowing for the banning certain types of single-use packages and products. Minister of Environment Pauline Frost tabled Bill 14 today in the Yukon Legislative Assembly. The Bill would allow for new rules around how single-use products and packages are made, supplied, distributed and used.  Single-use products, like plastic and paper bags are harmful to the environment and expensive to deal with when they become waste. In the 2019 Speech from the Throne, the Government of Yukon announced plans to ban on single-use bags.            Single-use packaging is a growing problem, but one we can address by reducing the amount of single-use products we use in the territory.  Banning single-use packages and products will help Yukon align with national and international efforts to reduce waste in our environment and landfills.  	       Minister of Environment Pauline Frost             Quick facts       The low cost of producing and disposing of single-use items has increased the amount of disposable plastic products and packaging that end up in our environment. Only nine per cent of plastic is recycled in Canada.    Plastics that are not recycled, like some single-use bags, are an increasing problem because they end up in our waterways, forests and in the stomachs of wildlife and birds.  Plastic takes thousands of years to break down. Even as it breaks down, plastic in our environment is still hazardous as tiny pieces are often eaten by fish and aquatic life.

400,2020-10-01,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/economy-remains-resilient-supports-yukoners-continue,Government Website,Economy remains resilient as supports for Yukoners continue,"           Published 01/10/2020        Premier and Finance Minister Sandy Silver tabled the 2020–21 First Supplementary Estimates in the Legislative Assembly today. The $92.2 million supplementary budget Bill includes an increase of $95.9 million in Operations and Maintenance spending and a decrease of $3.7 million in gross capital expenditures. A total of $52.1 million is recoverable from the Government of Canada and other third parties. The Bill includes proposed economic and social supports as well as expanded health services for Yukoners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantial increase in recoveries from Canada demonstrates the collaborative response between the federal government and the Government of Yukon to address urgent needs arising from COVID-19. In addition to COVID-19 related spending, the Bill includes funding to begin implementing the Putting People First plan for health and social care; an extension of the Early Learning and Child Care Agreement with the Government of Canada; additional operational capacity at the Mayo airport; and upgrades to Yukon’s energy grid. The 2020–21 Interim Fiscal and Economic Update was also released today, showing Yukon is one of only two Canadian jurisdictions expected to see real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2020.  Yukon’s real GDP growth is projected to grow 0.8 per cent, down from the 6.2 per cent forecast in March, with growth owing to strong momentum from last year and robust strength in the mining sector.            Protecting health and safety and supporting Yukoners through these unprecedented times has been our top priority throughout the pandemic. It is vital to ensure Yukoners can maintain their businesses, access reliable testing and health care, and continue to feel safe and secure in their community. Our government will continue to support Yukoners and Yukon businesses during their time of need because we are all in this together.      Minister of Finance Sandy Silver            Quick facts       Supplementary Estimates account for spending that is unforeseen at the time when the Main Estimates are tabled in the Legislative Assembly.  The Third Supplementary Estimates for 2019–20 was also tabled. It includes additional Operations and Maintenance spending of $7.6 million. This is primarily due to maintenance activities related to winter road maintenance, early responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and health services for hospital stays outside the territory as well as extended family care agreements.  The Interim Fiscal and Economic Update shows that Yukon’s economy remains strong compared to other provinces and territories, despite significant losses among the hardest hit sectors. Yukon’s fiscal outlook has been revised downward, but shows that the government is well positioned to remain resilient during this period of uncertainty.  The Interim Fiscal and Economic Update is published each fall to update the Fiscal and Economic Outlook published each spring. Both reports provide a snapshot of Yukon’s economy and government finances as well as updates on several indicators monitored by the Government of Yukon.

Glucose monitors can help individuals living with type 1 diabetes to monitor their glucose levels. Yukon was the first jurisdiction in Canada to provide coverage for continuous glucose monitors to youth age 18 years and younger. Now, Yukon again leads the nation in providing continuous glucose monitors for all Yukoners with type 1 diabetes. The Department of Health and Social Services has had ongoing conversations with industry that has enabled the Government Yukon to offer Yukoners a choice that best meets their needs. Yukoners can choose between a continuous glucose monitor or a flash glucose monitor.            We recognize the challenges Yukoners and families who live with type 1 diabetes face on a daily basis which is why we are expanding our funding to fully cover both flash and continuous glucose monitors. We thank and appreciate the local businesses who have come forward to support individuals with type 1 diabetes through the Yukon T1D Support Network.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost             Quick facts       Physicians will apply for coverage on behalf of their patients.  It is estimated that up to approximately 250 people in Yukon have type 1 diabetes.  To be eligible for the benefit, Yukoners with type 1 diabetes who meet the benefit criteria must register with the Chronic Disease and Disability Benefit program at 867-667-5092.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, September 30, at 2 p.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 3,402 people. COVID-19 Testing Centre From Tuesday, September 22, to Monday, September 28, we tested 157 people at the COVID-19 Testing Centre (CTC) in Whitehorse. The Respiratory Assessment Centre has been renamed the COVID-19 Testing Centre. Hours of operation are 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Sunday.  Referrals are no longer required for a COVID-19 test at the CTC. Road border schedule change for on-site personnel On-site road border personnel are transitioning from the current 24-hours a day schedule to 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Alaska Highway and Junction 37 borders beginning October 1. Travellers arriving outside of these hours will be required to sign a declaration and submit their self-isolation plan, along with a contact number when they arrive from outside of BC, the NWT or Nunavut. There will be on-site kiosks for completing the self-declaration, which is required by law.  The COVID-19 information station on the Alaska Highway in Whitehorse will also be closing as of 6 p.m. today. These changes reflect reduced road traffic as the winter season approaches. Process for public notifications regarding active cases Once Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) receives notification of a positive result of COVID-19 they then begin the process of contract tracing. This process involves speaking with the patient, family and close contacts to determine the level of risk of exposure.  Yukon Communicable Disease only contacts people who are identified as contacts. Public notifications are only issued when YCDC is not able to identify everyone who may have come into contact with an infected person. Guidance for Halloween and Thanksgiving The Chief Medical Officer of Health is encouraging Halloween to take place. Children should wear a non-medical mask or face covering, or consider a Halloween themed cloth mask; they should trick or treat in their consistent social bubble; not gather on doorsteps, and use a prop like a broom or a sword to ring doorbells. Those who are distributing candy should use a tool to offer treats, such as tongs or a hockey stick. Only distribute wrapped store bought candy. Please do not leave treats in a communal bucket. More information will be available on Yukon.ca. Singing and music performances We know there's risk associated with these activities and we have tools to manage that risk.  Keep a minimum of two metres between singers and musicians at all times. Face forward while singing or playing instruments (not in a circle or facing each other). Conductors should maintain four metres from the choir or orchestra or wear a face shield and maintain two metres’ distance. Performers should maintain four metres from the audience or be separated by plexiglas or similar barrier. Rehearsals are recommended to be 30 minutes or less.

Between now and the end of 2020, Yukon coaches who take NCCP multi-sport introduction or development courses online can have their registration fees reimbursed. These courses cover topics related to all sports and include such topics as coaching in secondary schools, designing a basic sport program and making ethical decisions. Coaches can register for these courses through the NCCP. Once they have completed a course, they can submit their receipt to the Sport and Recreation branch for reimbursement.            From a new skater’s first steps onto the ice, to a gymnast safely sticking their first round-off, to a high performance skier standing atop the podium, Yukon coaches play a critical role in the development of our territorial athletes. Coaches help build community, teach confidence and respectful behaviours. Coaches promote fairplay, diversity, inclusion and the value of staying active for life. Our government is pleased to support Yukon coaches to develop their skills so they can keep contributing to our vibrant sporting community.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            This is a terrific initiative to hopefully increase the numbers of coaches and the knowledge base of our coaches in Yukon.  This provides for a greater variety of courses to choose from and the online platform allows for the all the participants to make connections with a number of different coaches from all across Canada in a variety of different sports.      Board Member for Yukon Aboriginal Sport Circle & Sport Yukon, Dan Poleman            Quick facts       The National Coaching Certification Program (NCCP) offers standardized, inclusive, and sport safety education to coaches and coach developers.

With a capacity of 625 cubic metres, the new reservoir replaces an old reservoir constructed in 1971 that was nearing the end of its useful life. Water storage facilities like reservoirs are essential to keep a town like Faro supplied with clean drinking water. The reservoir buffers community water supply during peak demands, provides redundancy to other reservoirs while they are offline for maintenance, provides additional chlorine contact time for disinfection and provides water for local firefighting purposes. The final project costs are anticipated to be $1.94 million, with the Government of Canada contributing $1.13 million under the Investing Canada Infrastructure Plan, and the Government of Yukon funding the balance. Construction of the new reservoir was publicly tendered and awarded to Wildstone Construction.            The new water reservoir is a key piece of infrastructure that provides Faro residents with clean drinking water as well as resources to fight fires. Our government is proud to be upgrading core municipal infrastructure that supports healthy, thriving communities.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            On behalf of Council, I would like to thank and acknowledge the efforts of our federal and territorial partners for their continuous support as we work to develop our community. I would also like to specifically recognize the hard work of so many within the Department of Community Services, Community Development Branch and the Town of Faro. The water reservoir project is another example of our commitment to working collaboratively and despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, we persevered with relatively minor disruptions to the community. We look forward to strengthening our collaboration as we work to deliver several planned major projects in the near future.      Town of Faro Mayor Leonard Faber             Quick facts       Water reservoirs are storage facilities for a community’s water supply.  Construction of the Faro reservoir began in spring 2020.  The water reservoir is an above-ground, glass-fused to steel tank with insulation and cladding.  It is one of three water reservoirs in Faro and is located behind Faro’s public administration building.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, September 30, at 2 p.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 3,402 people. COVID-19 Testing Centre From Tuesday, September 22, to Monday, September 28, we tested 157 people at the COVID-19 Testing Centre (CTC) in Whitehorse. The Respiratory Assessment Centre has been renamed the COVID-19 Testing Centre. Hours of operation are 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Sunday.  Referrals are no longer required for a COVID-19 test at the CTC. Road border schedule change for on-site personnel On-site road border personnel are transitioning from the current 24-hours a day schedule to 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Alaska Highway and Junction 37 borders beginning October 1. Travellers arriving outside of these hours will be required to sign a declaration and submit their self-isolation plan, along with a contact number when they arrive from outside of BC, the NWT or Nunavut. There will be on-site kiosks for completing the self-declaration, which is required by law.  The COVID-19 information station on the Alaska Highway in Whitehorse will also be closing as of 6 p.m. today. These changes reflect reduced road traffic as the winter season approaches. Process for public notifications regarding active cases Once Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) receives notification of a positive result of COVID-19 they then begin the process of contract tracing. This process involves speaking with the patient, family and close contacts to determine the level of risk of exposure.  Yukon Communicable Disease only contacts people who are identified as contacts. Public notifications are only issued when YCDC is not able to identify everyone who may have come into contact with an infected person. Guidance for Halloween and Thanksgiving The Chief Medical Officer of Health is encouraging Halloween to take place. Children should wear a non-medical mask or face covering, or consider a Halloween themed cloth mask; they should trick or treat in their consistent social bubble; not gather on doorsteps, and use a prop like a broom or a sword to ring doorbells. Those who are distributing candy should use a tool to offer treats, such as tongs or a hockey stick. Only distribute wrapped store bought candy. Please do not leave treats in a communal bucket. More information will be available on Yukon.ca. Singing and music performances We know there's risk associated with these activities and we have tools to manage that risk.  Keep a minimum of two metres between singers and musicians at all times. Face forward while singing or playing instruments (not in a circle or facing each other). Conductors should maintain four metres from the choir or orchestra or wear a face shield and maintain two metres’ distance. Performers should maintain four metres from the audience or be separated by plexiglas or similar barrier. Rehearsals are recommended to be 30 minutes or less. Ensure good ventilation where you are practising, space out in the room you are playing or singing in, open the window, practise outside if you can Regular cleaning of instruments, mouthpieces, music stands, drum sticks and other accessories is essential. Do not share cleaning cloths, instrument brushes or microphones.  Read the singing and music guidelines.   New charges under the Civil Emergency Measures Act Below is a summary of the charges laid on September 29.

The vision of the Aging in Place Action Plan is to ensure that Yukoners can access the supports needed to live safe, independent, and comfortable lives in their own home or community for as long as possible, regardless of age, income or ability level. In total, it recommends 56 specific actions to help achieve that vision. The action plan was developed based on extensive public engagement in 2018 and 2019 with seniors and Elders, governments, NGOs and community organizations. In total, more than 1,200 Yukoners participated in the engagement. The Aging in Place Action Plan complements Putting People First, the final report of the comprehensive review of Yukon’s health and social services. About a third of the recommendations in Putting People First are relevant to the Aging in Place Action Plan. To help Yukoners live healthy lives, the Government of Yukon has begun the work of implementing the recommendations and actions in the Aging in Place Action Plan and Putting People First, in addition to pursuing the goals and objectives identified in the Housing Action Plan for Yukon and the Safe at Home Plan to end and prevent homelessness.            We all have a role to play in helping Yukoners age in place. This plan provides a framework by which governments, First Nations, NGOs, the private sector, individuals, families and communities can work together to ensure that Yukoners can live full and meaningful lives as they age. Our government is committed to helping Yukon’s aging population live safe, independent, and comfortable lives surrounded by strong and supportive communities.      Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost            Quick facts       The action plan outlines four pillars for action: living a full and meaningful life; housing; transportation; and programs, services and infrastructure.  Some of the recommended actions in the plan are already underway or will be actioned immediately. Others are future steps that will require ongoing collaboration and partnership between the Government of Yukon and key community stakeholders.  It’s projected that Yukon’s senior population will more than double in the next 20 years.

408,2020-09-29,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/government-yukon-announces-funding-shingles-vaccine,Government Website,Government of Yukon announces funding for shingles vaccine,"           Published 29/09/2020        To support Yukoners’ long-term wellbeing and quality of life, the Government of Yukon is publicly funding a shingles vaccine for Yukoners between the ages of 65 and 70, the age at which the vaccine is most effective. Shingles is a viral infection that causes a painful rash, caused by the same virus as chickenpox. After someone has had chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue. Years later, the virus may reactivate as shingles. The shingles vaccine, Shingrix, will be publicly funded in Yukon beginning January 1, 2021.              Shingles can be very painful and disproportionately affects older adults. Vaccines are an important preventative tool that can help keep people healthy and reduce the need for primary, acute or urgent care. Funding this effective vaccine will help Yukoners age well and live healthy lives, and will have a positive impact on our territory’s health system.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Funding the shingles vaccine is in line with a recommendation in the Putting People First report, as well as feedback received as part of the Aging in Place public engagement.  There is an increased risk of shingles for older adults. While it is not a life-threatening condition, shingles can be very painful.  Vaccines can help reduce the risk of shingles. Shingrix is a two-dose, non-live vaccine that has been shown to be 90 per cent effective in preventing shingles.  Starting January 1, 2021, the shingles vaccine will be available free of charge at local pharmacies and by appointment at Community Health Centres. It is currently available at your pharmacy, for a fee, with a prescription from your physician.

409,2020-09-28,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/hiring-preference-initiative-starting-october-1,Government Website,Hiring preference initiative starting on October 1,"           Published 28/09/2020         An 18-month hiring preference pilot project for all Government of Yukon competitions will start on October 1. Competitions will continue to be open to all candidates. Hiring preference will be given to qualified candidates who self-identify as Yukon First Nation or Canadian Aboriginal ancestry. The pilot project is an initiative under Breaking Trail Together, a Government of Yukon plan to increase representation of First Nation employees in the public service. The plan was developed in collaboration with Yukon First Nations governments and addresses the Government of Yukon’s legal obligation under the Final Agreements to develop and implement a Representative Public Service Plan. The hiring preference is a two-tiered system. It gives qualified candidates:  first priority if they are of Yukon First Nation ancestry; and second priority if they are of Canadian Aboriginal ancestry.  The hiring preference is applied at the end of the competition. This occurs once all assessments are complete. Regardless of ancestry, successful candidates must posses all essential qualifications, knowledge, skills and suitability required to perform the job.            Our public service should reflect the population that we serve. This ensures the programs and services that we deliver are inclusive and meet the needs of all Yukoners. The preferential hiring pilot project allows us to test this approach to increasing representation of Aboriginal people within the Government of Yukon and advance reconciliation efforts with Yukon First Nations.      Minister of Public Service Commission Richard Mostyn            Ensuring Yukon First Nations are proportionally represented in the public service – Yukon’s largest employer – is an obligation of the Final Agreements. This pilot project supports preferential hiring and the increase of Yukon First Nations in the Yukon government workforce.      Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston            Quick facts       Yukon’s Aboriginal population is 23 per cent based on 2016 federal census data.  Government of Yukon employees who self-identify as Aboriginal is 15 per cent while Aboriginal people of working age, 20 to 64 years old, in Yukon is 22 per cent.  Preference hiring will help the Government of Yukon meet its employment equity objectives as well as Final Agreement obligations.  The goal is to increase the representation of Aboriginal people within the public service across a broad spectrum of occupations and pay levels.  The Government of Yukon remains the single largest employer in Yukon with more than 5,000 employees as of March 31, 2018.

The Government of Yukon is contributing $1.89 million and the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations is investing $500,000. The extension of water and sewer services from the Village of Haines Junction into the subdivision will provide services for 38 or more future homes for CAFN citizens and also improve services for some citizens already living in the area. A lift station will also be added to meet future needs. The subdivision expansion project is expected to be complete in fall 2021. Together with Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Dän nätthe äda Kaaxnox (Chief Steve Smith), Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna, Yukon Highways and Public Works Minister Richard Mostyn and Village of Haines Junction Mayor Thomas Eckervogt, met to mark the project with a ceremonial ground breaking on Johnson Street in the new subdivision expansion.   Initial grubbing and clearing of the area around Johnson Street has been completed by the First Nations and the construction of underground water and sewer lines has begun. The Government of Yukon’s Land Development Branch managed the initial stages of the project with a custom-built Design Collaboration Agreement with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. 	The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations is completing the project through a Transfer Payment Agreement with the Government of Yukon. As well, the CAFN and the Village of Haines Junction have updated the water and sewer agreement to include service for the new lots and lift station in the Marshall Creek subdivision expansion. This will bring the regional system together while the new agreement provides an equal fee structure for equal service between the municipality and CAFN lots.            The Government of Canada will continue working to ensure a safe and sustainable economic recovery, while focusing on the health and well-being of all Yukoners. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this infrastructure project in Haines Junction and Champagne and Aishihik First Nations is essential. It not only helps to ensure the speedy recovery of our economy and provide needed jobs, it also helps to protect the well-being of our communities, and our environment, now and into the future.

This area is important to Carcross/Tagish First Nation people, local residents, recreational users and visitors of the Tagish River. This draft recommended management plan aims to protect the Tagish River for future generations and to provide a path forward for sustainable use of this culturally and ecologically important area. Finalizing the Tagish River Habitat Protection Area recommended management plan will meet an important milestone in implementation of the Carcross/Tagish First Nation Final Agreement, and balance important ecological conservation, valued recreational use, and protection of cultural vales.  Public meetings will be held in October 2020.            It is exciting to see this management plan moving towards completion. I encourage all users of the Tagish River area to come to the public meetings to learn about the recommended management plan and provide feedback on how to protect this culturally and ecologically significant area.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Carcross/Tagish First Nation is encouraged that through this recommended management plan people will be able to re-establish their relationship and connection to the land and water that makes up the Tagish River Habitat Protection Area.

This award recognizes the contributions of the Liard First Nation Language Department to literacy in the territory, and to the body of literature and language materials for Yukon First Nations languages in general and for the Kaska language in particular. Premier Sandy Silver presented the award to the Language Department today in Watson Lake. Elder Leda Jules and the late Richard Charlie recorded and transcribed countless interviews with Kaska Elders. Their work spans four decades, generating a large repository of Kaska Traditional Knowledge materials that contribute to present-day learning, research and language preservation. Mrs. Jules has also published several academic books as wells as Kaska children’s books. The Language Department has contributed significantly to the University of British Columbia’s Kaska Language website and the online Kaska Talking Dictionary. Its recent work to digitize language resources has enabled the voices of the Elders and other materials to be shared widely. The Language Department continues to develop new materials and support Kaska language learners in the community and beyond. Along with Mrs. Jules, Director Martina Volfová and her staff, Jocelyn Wolftail, Paul Caesar, Emeral Poppe and Josephine Caesar, are determined to continue their work to protect and preserve the Kaska language, which is inseparable from its people, culture, traditional knowledge, land and heritage.            It is my honour to recognize the Liard First Nation Language Department for its contributions to literacy and Kaska language revitalization. For decades, this group has found innovative ways to share the Kaska language with modern learners and keep this language alive into the future. Their work demonstrates the importance of inter-generational learning and the critical relationship of languages to culture, heritage, traditional knowledge, and relationship with the land.      Premier Sandy Silver            Congratulations to the Liard First Nation Language Department for receiving this prestigious award. The Language Department’s countless collaborations with researchers and academic institutions over the years have contributed immensely to the study of the Kaska language and Dene languages.

427,2020-09-17,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/expanded-rebates-renewable-home-heating-now-available,Government Website,Expanded rebates for renewable home heating now available,"           Published 17/09/2020        Good Energy rebates for heat pumps, an efficient renewable heating system for homes, are now available. Heat pumps extract heat from the outside air or ground and push it into a building. This process allows a heat pump to significantly reduce energy use for heating. Cold climate heat pumps are able to extract heat from even very cold air and are proven to be more efficient than traditional heating systems down to -25°C. Homeowners can receive rebates covering 40 per cent of project costs, up to a maximum of $8,000 for a new air or ground source heat pump. In addition to the expanded rebate, the Government of Yukon is seeking participants for a heat pump pilot project. In partnership with Yukon’s electrical utilities, the project will support the installation of 25 heat pumps for both commercial and residential buildings that already have certain heating systems installed. The pilot project seeks to understand how this technology and existing heating systems interact to optimize performance for homes and electrical grid. The Government of Yukon will cover installation costs of up to 40 per cent up to a maximum of $10,000. The expanded rebate program and new pilot project are commitments under Our Clean Future: A Yukon strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy.            Heating is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Yukon. As part of our government’s actions to address climate change, guided by the Our Clean Future strategy, we are excited to provide additional incentives to encourage Yukoners to adopt a highly efficient and cost effective heating technology. Heat pump technology will not only reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but also save homeowners and businesses money.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       Heat pumps are powered by electricity and use significantly less energy to heat the same space as electric baseboard heaters.  Heat pumps are a proven technology that work in Yukon’s cold climate.  Heat pumps are often paired with electric or conventional back-up heating systems that provide supplemental heating on the coldest days.  Home or business owners who wish to participate in the pilot project can contact the Energy Branch to find out if their home or business is the right fit for the project.  Monitoring from the pilot project will provide additional information and options for the electrical utilities to more efficiently manage peak demand and help address the growing demand and impacts from electric heating in homes.

The extension will provide more time and opportunities to safely connect and gather perspectives on these programs and services. Engagement opportunities with families, educators, school communities, partners and Yukon First Nations originally planned for April and May 2020 are being rescheduled for this fall. The extended engagement opportunities include: An online tool to gather perspectives and experiences from students, families, partners, school communities, staff and the public. Focus groups led by the review consultant with: 		Educators, including Learning Assistance Teachers, School Counsellors, Educational Assistants, etc.; Yukon First Nations; School Councils; and The Advisory Committee for Yukon Education and other professionals who work with children and youth with diverse needs.  An interim update on the review is now available, with the information gathered to date by the consultant about Yukon’s current service model for these programs, along with questions and resources to consider as the review moves forward. The consultant’s final report for this review and a summary of what was heard through the engagement activities will be shared by the end of March 2021. Along with the recommendations from the 2019 audit report, this report will be used to frame collaboration with Yukon First Nations and education partners to respond to the feedback and findings from this review and together develop next steps and actions to improve and modernize these programs to more effectively support student learning needs and outcomes.            The Government of Yukon remains committed to working with families and communities to ensure all students have the learning supports they need. We look forward to hearing the perspectives and experiences of students, families, partners, school communities, Yukon First Nations and staff so that we can improve inclusive and special education in our territory.      Minister of Education, Tracy-Anne McPhee             I appreciate how open people have been in sharing their thoughts about inclusive and special education. Even at these early stages, I can see that there are some incredible strengths here in the Yukon that can serve as a springboard to address the challenges that have been identified. It’s unfortunate the work had to be put on hold due to the pandemic, but it has provided a good opportunity to reflect on the process and on the discussions that have happened so far. I hope this interim update can inspire people to start thinking about their own stories with inclusive and special education, and the kinds of changes they’d like to see. I look forward to connecting with people to hear those stories and ideas once the review starts back up again.      Nikki Yee, independent review consultant             Quick facts       This review responds to Recommendation 70 in the Auditor General of Canada’s 2019 report, Kindergarten Through Grade 12 Education in Yukon.   The purpose of this review is to identify barriers and opportunities in the current service model and questions and resources to consider, by hearing from families, educators, and communities about their experiences with current programming and by learning about what other jurisdictions are doing.  The review began in February 2020, starting with the Department of Education’s current practices, procedures and legislated responsibilities, and initial meetings with central staff and school administrators.  The interim update from the consultant includes information and research gathered so far. This update will be referenced in the online tool and focus groups sessions that are being rescheduled.            Contact   Janine Workman 	Cabinet Communications 	867-332-0480janine.workman@gov.yk.ca Kyle Nightingale 	Communications, Education 	867-336-0653kyle.nightingale@gov.yk.ca   Nikki Yee 	Independent review consultant  	778-846-5049     News release #:   20-259    Related information:   Review of Inclusive and Special Education Interim Update Auditor General of Canada report  Learn about the Advisory Committee for Yukon Education        "

COVID-19 cases and recoveries 	As of today, September 16, at 2 p.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 3,020 people. Respiratory Assessment Centre 	From Wednesday, September 9, to Tuesday, September 16, we tested 129 people at the Respiratory Assessment Centre in Whitehorse. Symptom criteria for staying home from schools and daycares  	We have developed guidance based on three colour zones to help parents and guardians know when to keep children home from school or daycare. “Green” means the child is well, has no symptoms and can attend school. This green zone includes situations where they have symptoms consistent with a previously diagnosed health condition and which are not unusual for that child. “Yellow” means the child has symptoms such as a runny nose, a headache or fatigue. The yellow zone means the child should stay at home for 24 hours and see whether the symptoms progress or resolve.   If a child has a runny nose or nasal congestion that persists beyond 24 hours but it’s mild and doesn’t progress and the child is otherwise well, then the child may go back to school or daycare. Yellow symptoms are: Headache Runny nose or congestion Sore throat Fatigue or just unwell, or unable to participate in usual activities Major or intense fatigue Generalized muscle pain (not related to physical exertion) Significant loss of appetite Vomiting or diarrhea If a child only has vomiting or diarrhea, they can return to school when they have no further symptoms for at least 24 hours. “Red” means the child has a new cough, fever or difficulty breathing. In these situations, we recommend that they’re tested for COVID-19 and are assessed by a health care provider as needed. We especially recommend testing if a child has more than one of the following “red” symptoms: Cough Fever Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Loss of taste or smell If a child isn’t tested, they must remain in self-isolation until their symptoms resolve and for at least 10 days from when they started having symptoms. Six new charges under the Civil Emergency Measures Act 	Six new charges were laid under the Civil Emergency Measures Act on September 11 and September 15. Two charges were laid on September 11: failure to self-isolate; and failure to transit through Yukon. Four charges were laid on Sept 15: two failures to self-isolate; and two failures to behave in a manner consistent with the declaration. We will not provide information that may identify anyone, such as their name or where they received the charge. Reminder about isolation requirements 	Travellers who are required to self-isolate must complete their entire 14-day isolation when they arrive back in Yukon. This includes people who spent time in BC, the NWT or Nunavut after they travelled from other regions of Canada or internationally. The entire 14-day isolation must happen after people arrive in Yukon. People must also be reachable at the phone number and address they’ve provided on their declaration form throughout their period of self-isolation. They may receive a spot check call from the Government of Yukon. These spot check calls are separate from the Public Health Agency of Canada checks that are for people who have been outside the country. Enforcement statistics 	The Government of Yukon has received 795 complaints: Failure to self-isolate: 441 Social gatherings over 10 inside or 50 outside: 23 Failure to transit through Yukon in 24 hours or stay on the designated route: 308 Businesses failing to comply with Orders: 8 Failure to abide by a declaration form or not permitted entry into Yukon: 13 Other: 2 There have been 12 charges in total laid under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA).

Glucose monitors can help individuals living with type 1 diabetes to better monitor their glucose levels. Yukon is the first jurisdiction in Canada to provide coverage for continuous glucose monitors to individuals 18 years of age and younger, and joins Ontario and Quebec in providing coverage for flash glucose monitors. If adults prefer to use a continuous glucose monitor, they can apply their flash glucose monitor coverage to the cost of a continuous glucose monitor. Adults with additional medical needs, for example dementia, can apply for full coverage of a continuous glucose monitor device. Adult Yukoners are encouraged to work with their health care professional to determine the most appropriate support to manage their diabetes.            We recognize the challenges Yukoners and families who live with type 1 diabetes face on a daily basis and we are committed to supporting them to live happy, healthy lives. This coverage will help adults living with type 1 diabetes in Yukon manage their condition and improve their quality of life.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Diabetes Canada commends the Yukon government for adding coverage of flash glucose monitoring for adults with type 1 diabetes to its existing coverage of continuous glucose monitors for children with type 1. These devices are health-protecting and potentially life-saving for many people with diabetes. It is critically important that people with diabetes, in consultation with their health care providers, be able to access the glucose monitoring system that best meets their needs. Diabetes Canada acknowledges the dedication of community volunteers who have been advocating for this important policy and encourages other provinces and territories to follow suit and cover these life-changing devices.      President and CEO of Diabetes Canada Laura Syron            Quick facts       Physicians will apply for coverage on behalf of their patients.  It is estimated that up to approximately 250 people in Yukon have type 1 diabetes.  To be eligible for the benefit, Yukoners with type 1 diabetes who meet the benefit criteria must register with the Chronic Disease and Disability Benefit program at 867-667-5092. People aged 65 or older can contact the Pharmacare program at 867-667-5403.  A flash glucose monitors does not require a finger prick to monitor glucose levels, rather, a small sensor is inserted just under the skin of the upper arm, and when scanned every eight hours, it provides a current glucose reading and a continuous trend graph to a reader’s device.

432,2020-09-14,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/climate-change-energy-and-green-economy-strategy-yukon-announced,Government Website,"Climate change, energy and green economy strategy for Yukon announced ","           Published 14/09/2020         Today the Government of Yukon released Our Clean Future: A Yukon strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy. The strategy includes 131 actions the Government of Yukon will take to address the impacts of climate change while building a green economy and ensuring Yukoners can access reliable, affordable and renewable energy over the next decade. The final strategy incorporates new details developed since the release of the 2019 draft strategy, including additional information about reporting, increased renewable energy targets, a new 2050 greenhouse gas reduction target, and completion dates for the 131 actions. The territory-wide strategy aims to reduce Yukon’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent and ensure Yukon is resilient to the impacts of climate change by 2030. Over the next decade, the Government of Yukon, in partnership with the Government of Canada, will invest more than $500 million to implement this strategy and create new jobs in our green economy. To help Yukoners take part in Our Clean Future the Government of Yukon has launched a new suite of clean transportation rebates. These clean transportation incentives will help make zero-emission and electric vehicles more affordable while creating local business opportunities that boost Yukon’s economy.            Yukoners are passionate about climate change and want to make sure we do our part to make a difference. This strategy marks an important turning point for Yukon as we collectively take steps towards a sustainable future that benefits Yukoners. Our Clean Future meets the challenges we face today and sets a clear direction for a strong, resilient and clean future.      Premier Sandy Silver            Our Clean Future is an ambitious, Yukon-wide strategy to address our changing climate in a sustainable way. The strategy outlines tangible actions we will take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts over the next decade. All Yukoners have a stake in this strategy and together we can ensure our territory takes action to preserve our environment for future generations.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            While addressing climate change is challenging, it also presents new opportunities for innovation and economic growth. Investing in building retrofits, encouraging Yukoners to purchase clean technologies like zero emission vehicles and supporting the renewable energy projects needed to power our future will support meaningful jobs in a forward-looking, green economy. Our Clean Future lays out how we can be part of the solution when it comes to climate change while building a bright future for Yukoners.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and Economic Development Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       The Government of Yukon collaborated with Yukon First Nations, transboundary Indigenous groups and Yukon municipalities to establish Our Clean Future’s priorities. The final strategy reflects input from Yukoners, non-governmental and community organizations, industry and private businesses, First Nations and municipal governments gathered during two rounds of public engagement in 2018 and 2019.  Actions from eight Indigenous and municipal partners are showcased in Our Clean Future, highlighting continued community leadership on climate change.

433,2020-09-10,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/coming-together-caribou,Government Website,Coming together for caribou,"           Published 10/09/2020        Partners to the Canadian Porcupine Caribou Management Agreement gathered on September 3, 2020, to respond to the Record of Decision on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and reaffirm our commitment to conserving the Porcupine caribou herd and its habitat. Together, the parties released this statement: “We do not believe the selected alternative in the Record of Decision is sustainable for Porcupine caribou. We remain committed to co-operatively managing the herd and its habitat within Canada to ensure the conservation of the herd, in particular for providing for ongoing cultural and subsistence needs.”            The Government of Yukon and our partners have consistently identified and demonstrated that development in the refuge has high risks of significant negative impacts to wildlife populations, particularly the Porcupine caribou herd. The Government of Yukon will continue to stand in solidarity with the Gwich’in People, advocating for the protection of the Porcupine caribou herd’s sacred and sensitive calving grounds on the Alaskan coastal plain.      Government of Yukon Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            The Gwich’in have lived in balance with the Porcupine Caribou herd since before any mark of modern history and, as expected, officials in the U.S. administration tasked with advancing destruction of the herd’s nursery recognized that it was in their best interest to discard that. The Record of Decision validates our experience of the erosion of integrity in assessments, process and respect: our Traditional Knowledge disrespected, our requests for consultation ignored, and our concerns disregarded. In finalizing the Oil and Gas leasing alternative, the U.S. administration violated our inherent and human rights, and the rights of all of the Indigenous users of the herd in Canada. But our rights cannot be discarded nor our voices silenced.      Chief Dana Tizya-Tramm​, Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation            Porcupine Caribou are invaluable to the culture and subsistence of Indigenous Peoples and northerners. Maintaining the long-term success of the herd is critical to maintaining Indigenous people’s culture and right to traditional harvest. Our partnership approach to conserving Porcupine Caribou is our key strength for addressing our shared concerns with proposed development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I will continue to support our partners in their efforts while working with my cabinet colleagues on this important issue.      Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada Jonathan Wilkinson            The Porcupine caribou herd has sustained Gwich'in and Inuvialuit people for thousands of years. While many other communities in the Northwest Territories suffer the hardships of declining caribou, the Porcupine remains one of the last great healthy migratory herds in the world. While the Government of the Northwest Territories supports a balanced approach to caribou conservation and economic development, our government is deeply concerned about the recent decision of the U.S. administration to open up all Porcupine caribou calving and post-calving lands to oil and gas development. The GNWT remains committed to working with our co-management partners to support the wise management of the Porcupine herd.      Government of the Northwest Territories Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Shane Thompson            The Gwich’in Tribal Council remains committed to protecting the sacred grounds of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. We stand united with our allies against the irresponsible Record of Decision issued by the Trump Administration. The Porcupine Caribou are essential to the survival of both our people and our culture. We will not rest until the calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou on the sacred Coastal Plain is permanently protected for future generations.      Gwich’in Tribal Council Grand Chief Ken Smith            The Inuvialuit have depended on the Porcupine Caribou for hundreds of years for food, cultural and social well-being. The important role of this caribou herd is reflected in the protections and conservation measures provided under the Inuvialuit Final Agreement. These include provisions for the implementation of the Porcupine Caribou Management Agreement (PCMA), the establishment of Ivvavik National Park and the conservation measures for the Yukon North Slope as means to cooperatively manage the herd and protect the Porcupine Caribou calving grounds and habitat that lay within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region.  The Inuvialuit Game Council is not against development but feels there needs to be a balance struck between economic gain and indigenous cultural and social well-being. The Council is troubled by regulatory decisions that do not take into account the potentially negative impacts that opening ANWR to oil and gas development may have on this herd, the habitat it relies on and the many indigenous groups that depend on it for their traditional practices. The Inuvialuit Game Council continues to work with the other Parties to ensure the persistence of this herd for future generations.      A/Chair for the Inuvialuit Game Council Jim Elias            The Porcupine caribou herd is an important part of the northern way of life and a valuable traditional food source for so many. It is through the respectful harvest of this herd that we express our First Nations culture and our subsistence rights. We stand with our partners in protecting ANWR against any activity that erodes the viability of the Porcupine caribou herd. Protecting ANWR, protecting the herd, and protecting our culture are one in the same.       ​Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Chief Roberta Joseph           Contact   Government of Yukon Janine Workman 	Cabinet Communications 	867-332-0480Janine.workman@gov.yk.ca Vuntut Gwitchin Government Elizabeth Staples 	Caribou Coordinator 	778-668-0811estaples@vgfn.net Government of Canada Moira Kelly 	Press Secretary 	Office of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change 	819-271-6218moira.kelly@canada.ca Media Relations 	Environment and Climate Change Canada 	819-938-3338 or 1-844-836-7799 (toll-free)ec.media.ec@canada.ca Government of the Northwest Territories  Joslyn Oosenbrug 	Public Affairs and Communications 	Department of Environment and Natural ResourcesENR_Communications@gov.nt.ca Gwich’in Tribal Council  Amber Keegan 	Policy, Negotiations, and Communications Specialist 	867-777-7923Amber.Keegan@gwichintribal.ca Joint Secretariat on behalf of the Inuvialuit Game Council  Jennifer Lam 	Committee Program Managercpmanager@jointsec.nt.ca Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Government Elaine Corden 	Communications Coordinator 	(867) 993-7100 ext. 136elaine.corden@trondek.ca     News release #:   20-254    Related information:   Porcupine Caribou Management Board        "

435,2020-09-09,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukon-extending-state-emergency-maintain-response-covid-19,Government Website,Yukon extending state of emergency to maintain response to COVID-19,"           Published 09/09/2020        Please note that the formatting of the list of repealed Ministerial Orders has been corrected. The Government of Yukon is extending the state of emergency under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA). The extension will allow the Ministerial Orders issued under CEMA to remain in place to continue to support and protect Yukoners, including the Health Protection Order. Ministerial Orders issued under CEMA include a range of measures, such as health protections setting requirements for entry to Yukon, and mandatory self-isolation when applicable, along with other orders that extend benefits and protections related to economic impacts, such as landlord and tenant protections. The state of emergency and accompanying orders enable the government to adapt and respond rapidly to the pandemic and to keep pace with developments across Canada, with the aim to minimize risk and help Yukoners to manage through uncertainty. The Government of Yukon regularly evaluates the need for the state of emergency and Ministerial Orders issued under CEMA and may repeal any that are no longer necessary to the current pandemic situation. As of September 9, the following Ministerial Orders have been repealed: Self-Isolation Exception for Traditional Activities; Property Tax Relief; Remote Cannabis Sales; Virtual Commissioning, Signing and Witnessing; and the Amendment of Government Contract Provisions. The Driver Medical Order, which temporarily exempted drivers who are 70 years of age or from having to submit a medical examination certificate, if required, will expire in 90 days. All Yukoners can continue do their part in ensuring the health and safety of their family members, neighbours and communities by practising the Safe 6.            We know that Yukoners are concerned about the continued possibility of importing COVID-19 to the territory. As a territory we have done well because we have worked together to protect the Yukon and guard against this pandemic. Nothing is more important than protecting the health and wellbeing of all Yukoners. Extending the state of emergency does not mean there is an increased risk to Yukoners at this time. The purpose of the extension is to ensure our government can continue to react quickly and to respond to the needs of Yukoners during COVID-19.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       A full list of the orders and legislative changes made under the Civil Emergency Measures Act can be found on Yukon.ca/changes-legislation-covid-19.  Violations of the orders under the Civil Emergency Measures Act are an offence and are punishable by a fine or imprisonment.  While we wait for an effective treatment or vaccine, public health measures will remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.  The six steps to staying safe are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10 people indoors, or 50 outdoors, and keeping two metres apart; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required.  From Wednesday, September 2, to Tuesday, September 8, 163 people were tested for COVID-19 at the Respiratory Assessment Centre in Whitehorse.  The Government of Yukon has received 760 complaints: Failure to self-isolate: 423 Gathers over 10 inside or 50 outside: 22 Failure to transit through Yukon in 24 hours or stay on their designated route: 291 Businesses failing to comply with Orders: 8 Failure to abide by declaration form or were not permitted entry into Yukon: 11 Other: 5 There have been six charges laid under the Civil Emergency Measures Act.

Born in Old Crow and raised mostly in the Bluefish River area, Mr. Frost lived a full and meaningful life. His strong beliefs that the land and animals must be protected for future generations will have a profound and long lasting impact in the community and across the north. His outgoing nature and love for storytelling will be missed deeply.  Mr. Frost’s dedication to his work at the community health centre, maintaining the local airstrip and his passion in the fight against climate change, are only some examples of his endless commitment to ensuring the health and safety of the Gwitchin people, land and wildlife. He generously shared his knowledge with so many. His contributions to his family, community this territory and the Gwitchin people will continue to be felt for many generations. We have lost a legend and our thoughts are with Elder Frost’s family and his entire community.

The regulation will help to foster a positive culture in the workplace as well as physical and psychological safety for Yukon workers. The Violence and Harassment Prevention Regulation will come into effect on September 4, 2021, giving employers a full year for implementation. During that time the Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board will be offering support, particularly to employers with small businesses, with a how-to guide, ready-to-use tools and training resources. In addition to the introduction of the new regulation, the Government of Yukon has made enhancements to the existing regulations about hazard assessment to make them clearer and easier to understand.            Everyone benefits in workplaces where the culture is positive and collaborative, and where there is trust, respect, teamwork and openness. Violence and harassment are not acceptable in any workplace. By focusing on their prevention, these regulations will make a significant contribution to creating the positive and healthy workplaces we all deserve.      Minister responsible for the Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board Jeanie Dendys            Every workplace has hazards. Identifying them and managing the risks they pose is the foundation of workplace health and safety. The Violence and Harassment Prevention Regulation highlights these two hazards and identifies actions that will help to control and mitigate their occurrence.      President and CEO, Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board, Kurt Dieckmann            Quick facts       In a public engagement in 2017, almost 70 per cent of survey respondents said they support amendments to the Occupational Health and Safety Act to allow for the development of regulations aimed at preventing mental injuries at work.  In 2019, the Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board hosted a public engagement to ask Yukon employers, workers and stakeholders for their input. It included stakeholder and public meetings, an online survey and written submissions.  The public engagement was summarized in a What We Heard report. It noted that Yukon employers, workers and stakeholders support regulation as a way to help prevent workplace violence and harassment and for clarification about the requirements for workplace hazard assessments.

This change, effective immediately, will support quality and efficient care by aligning what Yukon optometrists practice with the training Canadian optometrists currently receive in glaucoma management. Under the change, optometrists must still refer glaucoma patients to ophthalmologists when necessary, for example, in the care of complex cases or if a case is worsening. Expanding the scope of practice of optometrists means that Yukoners now have streamlined access to the care they need, an important step towards reducing red tape for Yukoners. This is yet another example of how modernizing and updating legislation and regulations can enhance the service Yukoners receive.            Our government is committed to improving the healthcare Yukoners can receive in the territory. These changes will allow optometrists to practice in a way that better aligns with their training while allowing ophthalmologists to focus on their areas of expertise and increases services available to Yukoners while supporting local businesses.

Families can check the updated routes at yukon.ca/en/school-bus-schedules. Bus routes need to be updated to accommodate a high volume of eligible students who were registered for the bus closer to the start of the school year. These registrations have now been processed and eligible students are being assigned a seat on the school bus, which is impacting existing bus routes. Changes to bus routes beyond pick-up times are not anticipated. Parents or guardians will be contacted directly if there are any changes beyond the pick-up time for their child.  Notification of assigned seat  Parents or guardians of eligible students who have now been assigned a seat on the school bus will be notified directly by e-mail of the student’s bus number. Students are only assigned a seat if their parents or guardians receive a direct notification. School bus passes  For the week of September 8, new students to the bus do not need their school bus pass to ride the bus.

Students should use the bus stop closest to their home as shown in the updated school bus routes. Accommodating students beyond eligibility  Following this update, school buses are operating near capacity while following the health and safety guidelines and accommodating eligible students who have registered. Eligibility to ride the school bus is outlined in the Education Act and Student Transportation Regulations. Students are eligible to ride the school bus to their school and back home if: they live more than 3.2 kilometres from their school; and they are attending their attendance area school. As the school year continues, seats that become available to students beyond the eligibility requirements will be assigned based on the order of priority: Kindergarten to Grade 3 students; Grade 4 to 7 students who live within 3.2 kilometers of their attendance area school; students who attend school outside of their attendance area; and special requests, including busing to stops other than from home to school and back, such as daycare centres. Additional buses The Government of Yukon has requested an additional three school buses through its school bus provider. The Government of Yukon continues to work with the school bus provider on timing for adding these additional buses to the existing fleet and will provide updates when available.

But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than residents’ personal health, it is also having a profound impact on the economy. That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna, Minister of Community Services for the Government of Yukon John Streicker and Mayor of the City of Whitehorse Dan Curtis announced funding for a project that will help protect the city from the threat of wildfires. The Whitehorse South West Fire Risk Reduction project will create a six-kilometre fireguard along the southwest corner of the City of Whitehorse. All conifer plants will be removed within the identified 150-hectare area and support the Whitehorse West Landscape-level Fuel Management Plan. The removal of conifer plants also follows the standards for the reduction of fire hazards on Crown lands. The creation of a fireguard in this area is critical to protecting the City of Whitehorse and residential dwellings surrounding the city. This project will improve the safety for residents and create jobs. The Government of Canada is investing over $1.1 million in this project through the Investing in Canada plan through the Green Infrastructure Stream (GIS). The Government of Yukon is providing $487,500.            In Yukon, wildfires are a constant threat to communities and climate change may increase the potential for forest fires in the future. This important project will ensure that Whitehorse and surrounding residential areas are protected. This investment is helping to protect the health and safety of Yukoners.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna            A bold strategy for wildfire-resilient communities calls for visionary projects. I am excited to join my partners from the Government of Canada and the City of Whitehorse in announcing the start of this significant milestone. The forest fuels that are being removed during this project will offer a major opportunity to support Yukon’s emerging biomass sector, and the resulting fuel break will be an important natural capital asset that will reduce the risk of fire to the City of Whitehorse. Thanks to this and other pieces of our government’s new strategic vision for reducing wildfire hazards, we are making huge progress towards more wildfire resilient communities.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            The City of Whitehorse is committed to protecting its residents from the threat of wildfire. As part of this commitment, we performed extensive fuel abatement work along the Copper Haul Road this past winter. Fuel abatement is a key capital project for us and public safety is one of City Council’s Strategic Priorities. I would like to thank our partners for their continued support in keeping Whitehorse residents safe.      Mayor of the City of Whitehorse Dan Curtis            Quick facts       Through the Investing in Canada plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.

443,2020-09-01,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/fh-collins-track-and-field-complex-now-complete,Government Website,The F.H. Collins track and field complex is now complete,"           Published 01/09/2020        The new track and field complex at F.H. Collins Secondary School is now complete and opened to the public today. Minister of Community Services John Streicker, Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee, Member of Parliament Larry Bagnell, Whitehorse Mayor Dan Curtis and MLA Nils Clarke joined representatives from Athletics Yukon, the Yukon Soccer Association and F.H. Collins School to celebrate the opening of the facility.   The track and field complex is a public asset that offers a world-class recreation facility to schools and the broader athletic community and will create opportunities for residents, visitors and athletes for years to come. It provides recreation opportunities for all ages and groups, including seniors, children, and people with disabilities. Like all other school fields, the public can access the facility when it is not in use, or can make sport-specific bookings during the operational season by calling the Whitehorse Parks and Recreation Department at 867-633-8518. In order to keep the compound open and accessible to all, we are asking all users to take care of the track and artificial turf field by taking the following measures: Wear clean footwear without metal or screw-in cleats on the track and artificial turf field. Keep dogs and other animals off the facility, except service animals. Do not bring any food or beverages other than water into the facility. Non-motorized wheelchairs and strollers permitted only.            Our government is so proud to support this great new facility! I am incredibly honored to be here for the grand opening and welcome the community. Whether it’s Under 6 soccer, hosting meets, extending our seasons or training for games, this new track and field will serve Yukoners for years to come.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            I’m very pleased to see the new track and field complex open. This new facility enhances F.H. Collins Secondary school, and will expand and enhance sport opportunities for school and athletic communities across Whitehorse and Yukon, while supporting the health and wellness of Yukoners.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            Strategic investments in recreational infrastructure play a key role in making sure communities stay active and healthy. Not only do these facilities benefit the students and athletes of Whitehorse, but the completion of this track and this field come at a very welcome time, during COVID isolation, and will go a great distance in contributing to our community’s overall physical and mental health.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell            This new track and field complex is a much welcomed addition to our community and to F.H. Collins, which happens to be the school I graduated from many years ago. I am excited for this facility to be around for many generations to come and I commend the Government of Canada, as well as the Government of Yukon for making this happen.      Mayor of Whitehorse Dan Curtis            Yukon Soccer appreciates the community effort put forth to complete the track and turf at F.H. Collins Secondary School. We are honored to have access to the facility for soccer games. Let’s all do our part to help each other follow the rules and keep the track and turf clean. Thanks.      Yukon Soccer Association president Fabien Glyka            Athletics Yukon is thrilled to be a part of the first rubberized Track and Field facility North of 60, in Canada!      Athletics Yukon president Kristen Johnston            Quick facts       The budget for this project is $8.2 million. The Government of Canada contributed over $6 million through the Small Communities Fund from its Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Yukon has contributed $2 million.  Rubberizing the surface of the track provides a more comfortable surface and can enhance athletic performance. A rubberized track is less likely to generate stress fractures amongst athletes than concrete or asphalt pavement, and can also enhance speed. However, rubberized surfaces also require specific care and maintenance in order to last.  The facility has lights for night use, which will extend the track and field season in Yukon.  The track took two summers to build due to the weather conditions required to rubberize the surface. The rubberizing of the track was completed in August 2020.  Sporting activities on the new facility during COVID-19 should follow the sport and recreation guidelines.

To mark the release of the article, the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre along with the American Museum of Natural History will be hosting an online panel discussion with lead scientist and author Dr. Emil Karpinski, Yukon palaeontologist Dr. Grant Zazula and other collaborators. Entitled Mysteries of the Mastodon, the discussion will highlight Yukon’s role as a key site for the study of responses and adaptations to climate in prehistoric animal populations. Recognizable for their tusks and muscular trunks, the mastodon was one of the largest mammals on earth during the ice age. Roaming from present-day Yukon and Alaska to as far south as Mexico, the species went extinct approximately 11,000 years ago. By examining DNA preserved in fossilized teeth, tusks and bones from these ancient creatures, including specimens from the Old Crow and Dawson City areas, the international team of scientists found that ice age American mastodons migrated northward to the Arctic multiple times in the past in response to dramatic global warming events of the ice age. For more information and to participate in the event, visit the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre’s Facebook page.            This study is another great example of the significance of the Yukon Palaeontology Program’s research. With our outstanding fossil records and knowledgeable and dedicated team, Yukon continues to be a leader in Beringia and ice age research.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys            The pattern of ice age animals moving northward when climates warmed up is very similar to what we are observing with present-day wildlife. Yukon’s fossil record of American mastodons provides valuable perspective to climatically-driven movements of animals into the North.      Yukon palaeotonolgist Dr. Grant Zazula            Quick facts       This paper was a collaboration between scientists across Canada, Mexico, Australia, and the United States.  Previous research from Yukon's palaeontology program developed the original idea for this genetic study and provided several fossils of mastodons that are part of the Government of Yukon fossil collections.  This is the first large-scale genetic study of American mastodons, understanding the migration paths of mastodons and their response to climate change.  Today at 10 a.m., the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre (YBIC) will be hosting online a panel discussion with the contributing authors live on the YBIC Facebook page.

This funding is part of the $500 million in COVID-19 relief funding that the Government of Canada announced in May 2020 for cultural, heritage and sport organizations across the country. The Government of Yukon’s Sport and Recreation branch is administering the funds directly to eligible not-for-profit sport and recreation organizations. These Yukon organizations can use the funds to cover COVID-19 related expenses they may have previously incurred because of closures or may experience in the future, as they adapt and operate under new guidelines.            Our recreation and sport organizations play such a vital role in our lives as Yukoners. They help keep us physically active and mentally healthy. They provide training and skill development. They give us opportunities to connect with each other. Sport & recreation groups, like many other organizations in our territory, have been affected by COVID-19. Thanks to the federal government, we’re hopeful these relief funds will support sport organizations as we all adapt to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Recreation is important, as it helps build inclusive communities, where families and friends can have fun and spend time together. In times like these where isolation is part of our day-to-day lives, it is especially important that we stay active and healthy for our overall physical and mental health. These funds will help keep us connected, as we navigate our ‘new normal’.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell              Quick facts       To ensure eligible organizations receive this funding as soon as possible, the Sport and Recreation branch is first distributing $1,259,660, or roughly 75 per cent of the funds allocated to Yukon, to its existing clients, using a standard formula.  Sport and recreation organizations that are not clients of the branch and have sport or active recreation as a primary mandate can contact Sport Yukon on how to potentially access funding.    In the fall, after feedback and evaluation, the Government of Yukon will distribute the remaining $427, 331.  Examples of eligible expenses include costs typically covered by other revenues lost due to COVID-19 restrictions, hiring extra staff, materials or equipment required to mitigate impacts of COVID-19 or funding strategic planning in anticipation of future COVID-19 impacts.

Designed to assist the territory’s elite artists with projects and personal development, a special intake of the Advanced Artist Award saw $150,000 in funding conferred to 22 Yukon artists in the mediums of film, music, poetry, painting, textiles and more. Through the On Yukon Time program, 22 recipients ranging from musicians, carvers, writers, theatre troupes and community organizations have been awarded a total of just under $85,000. This intake of the On Yukon Time program was adapted for COVID-19 to include responses to the pandemic, and performances designed to work within the realities of physical distancing and other health restrictions. Details for the projects and beneficiaries are listed in the related information links below.            Yukon artists and community arts organizations continue to adapt and persevere in a time of crisis and uncertainty, offering both interpretation and outlet for Yukoners. The Government of Yukon congratulates each and every recipient and we are proud to lend added support through the evolving circumstances of our new normal.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys            Quick facts       The Arts Fund was increased to $625,000 total with an additional April intake for $125,000.  The Advanced Artist Award was increased by $75,000. This one-time increase made $150,000 available during this intake to support artists to enhance their artistic professional development.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, August 26, at 3 p.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 2,459 people. Respiratory Assessment Centre From Wednesday, August 19, to Tuesday, August 25, we tested 116 people at the Respiratory Assessment Centre in Whitehorse. Contact sports guidelines Guidelines for contact sports are now on Yukon.ca. By adapting the way we play contact sports to reduce the risk of COVID-19 we can get back on the ice, field and court. The new guidelines apply to children and adult leagues and supplement the Government of Yukon’s existing sport and recreation guidelines. Holding a gathering guidelines Guidelines for holding organized gatherings as well as social gatherings are now online. Organized gatherings are seated events in a rented venue, such as weddings, celebrations of life and cultural events. You can have up to 50 people at an organized event indoors and up to 100 people outdoors. All rental venues need to have an operational plan and guests and organizers need to follow the plan. Social gatherings are events in private homes or public spaces, such as birthday celebrations, retirement parties and backyard barbecues. You can have up to 10 people indoors or 50 people outdoors for these sorts of gatherings. When to stay home Yukoners are reminded not to go to work or school if they’re feeling sick. They should check the Iist of COVID-19 symptoms on Yukon.ca, complete the online assessment tool and get tested if that’s recommended. If someone in a family or household is unwell, the people they live with may go to work or school unless a health care provider has told them to stay home. This advice is the same if the person who’s unwell has been tested for COVID-19.  Testing and self-isolation Anyone who does not feel well should check the COVID-19 list of symptoms on Yukon.ca, complete the online assessment tool and get tested if it’s recommended. Anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 should self-isolate and use the online self-assessment tool at Yukon.ca, call 811 or contact their health care provider. They’ll receive guidance from a health care provider according to their individual circumstances. There are many unique situations that require guidance from public health officials. People who are tested for COVID-19 should continue to self-isolate until they receive their test result or until a health care provider advises them they no longer need to. People returning to or travelling into Yukon from anywhere except British Columbia, the Northwest Territories or Nunavut must self-isolate for a full 14 days, regardless of testing. We’re grateful to everyone who takes getting tested and self-isolation seriously and helps to reduce the risk of infection in their community. Reporting possible Civil Emergency Measures Act offences  If anyone has concerns that someone is violating a Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) Order, they can now fill in a form on Yukon.ca. People can also call the enforcement line at 1-877-374-0425.

The federal government will provide the funding in two phases: 50 per cent now and 50 per cent in early 2021. The Government of Yukon will have the flexibility to spend the funding according to its educational needs and could use it in a range of ways to protect students and staff during the pandemic, including adapting learning spaces, providing more custodial staff, supplying additional buses and providing mental health supports, health and safety training and more support for students and school communities.            This funding is very much appreciated. In my conversations with the Prime Minister and our federal colleagues, they continue to be very responsive to the needs of this territory as we manage the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic. This support will offset the costs incurred as we make sure schools are safe and adaptable to the needs of Yukon students.      Premier Sandy Silver            Yukon school communities have gone to great lengths to safely reopen schools and we are very proud of all of the work that has been done. There are costs to the adaptations that schools have made and this support will help offset these costs. We appreciate support from our federal government and look forward using these funds to the benefit of Yukon students and schools.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            Quick facts       The federal government has committed to provide provinces and territories with $2 billion in new federal funding to support the adaptation of the education sector to ensure a safe return to class in the fall.  Funding will be allocated on an equal per capita basis across the country to support students ages four to 18, with a $2 million base amount provided to each jurisdiction.  This funding is in addition to the $13.5 million allocated to the Government of Yukon through the Safe Restart Agreement completed earlier this month with the Government of Canada.

The safety and well-being of Northerners are top priorities of the governments of Canada and Yukon. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than residents’ personal health, it is also having a profound impact on the economy. That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna; and Minister of Community Services for the Government of Yukon John Streicker announced funding for three projects that will build or improve infrastructure in three communities across Yukon. One project is the construction of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Youth Centre in Dawson to enable youth to pursue traditional hobbies and activities such as music and fine arts. In Carcross, residents will benefit from clean water with upgrades and expansion to the sewage lagoon and the construction of a new lift station. In Watson Lake, retrofit upgrades to the administrative building will improve energy efficiency, lowering costs and improving comfort for employees and visitors. These projects will improve the quality of life of Yukon residents, and create immediate and long-term jobs. The Government of Canada is investing over $6.5 million in these projects through the Investing in Canada plan, including the Green Infrastructure Stream (GIS), Community Culture and Recreation Infrastructure Stream (CCRIS), Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS), and the New Building Canada Fund – Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component – Small Communities Fund (SCF). The Government of Yukon is providing over $2.4 million, while the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation is contributing $50,000.            Protecting the health and safety of Canadians is our first priority. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, investing in infrastructure in Yukon is essential to ensure the speedy recovery of our economy, provide needed jobs, and protect the well-being of our communities. This is a great example of how we are working with our partners to build stronger, more resilient infrastructure that will serve Yukoners now and in the future.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna            Community infrastructure is so important and these much-needed projects all help to improve the lives of Yukoners in different ways. A new youth centre for Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in youth will provide a valuable cultural space for young people in Dawson, while Carcross is getting much-needed upgrades to its sewage system. I am also pleased to see green energy retrofits to the public administration building in Watson Lake, which is another step to building resilience to climate change in our communities.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Tr'ondëk Hwëch’in is very pleased to be moving ahead with construction of a new Youth Centre. After several years of housing this vital program in temporary facilities that lack the space to offer adequate programming, we are looking forward to completion of a first-class centre designed specifically for our youth. We could not be more proud of the TH youth who worked to make their dream of a new Youth Centre a reality, raising funds, lobbying government leaders, and playing an active role in the design of the new facility. The Youth Centre has long played an important role in keeping our young people healthy and engaged, and we are excited for a facility that finally reflects its central role in the life of our community.      Chief of Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation Roberta Joseph            The Town of Watson Lake is grateful for the funding which is allowing us to upgrade our public administration building. These energy retrofits will make our building more comfortable for staff and for the public. It will help the town save money and reduce greenhouse gasses.

The Government of Yukon has replaced the current Tender Management System (TMS) with a new, more efficient platform called bids&tenders. The online system has features that will streamline procurement, including: electronic bidding that includes supplier registration, tender notifications and electronic submissions for suppliers; contract management that meets the standards of our financial systems; spend analytics for reporting and planning, leading to more strategic procurement and greater transparency; and vendor performance review program management that includes evaluation and tracking of contract performance. An online submission system will reduce the need for paper bids, flag compliance errors for bidders and improve spending analysis across government. Businesses interested in bidding on contracts with the Government of Yukon are encouraged to sign up for an account on bids&tenders. Online training is available to assist with creating an account or submitting a bid in the new system.            We are excited to launch this new eProcurement system to provide a faster and more accessible, reliable and transparent tendering system for businesses. Moving to online bids will save businesses time and money while maximizing the economic benefit for Yukoners. This is part of our enduring commitment to support the economy and drive competition and innovation in the Yukon.      Minister of Highway and Public Works Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       Businesses can learn how to use the new system through online training sessions found here.  To bid on upcoming contracts, individuals and businesses will be required to create an account on bids&tenders even if they send in a paper based submission.  As the new eProcurement system is phased in, paper-based procurement will be phased out. After January 1, 2021, paper based submissions will no longer be accepted and hard copies of tender documents will no longer be distributed for tenders posted.

Ice-rich permafrost under this section of the Hamilton Boulevard extension has been monitored for a number of years. Repairs can be made now that the permafrost has thawed.   Cobalt Construction Inc. of Whitehorse was awarded the contract for the work, which includes reconstruction of the subsurface and surface of the road, as well as installation of new guardrails and replacement of light standards. During that time, drivers can expect detours, traffic control and possible delays while the work is done.            We are pleased that we can now make repairs to this section of Hamilton Boulevard to provide a safer and smoother ride for road users. We thank residents for their patience over the past few years. This is one of several projects underway in Whitehorse and throughout the territory to improve road safety. As this work proceeds, travellers are reminded to drive carefully, pay attention to signs and flagging crews, slow down around construction zones, and give heavy duty equipment adequate space.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            For a number of years, this high-traffic area has been an issue for motorists. I would like to acknowledge the efforts made by Minister Richard Mostyn for these much-needed improvements over the years. We are thankful for these repairs and for the Government of Yukon’s respectful engagement during this lengthy process. Thank you for your patience while the contractor undertakes this work.      Mayor of City of Whitehorse Dan Curtis            Quick facts       South Hamilton Boulevard in Whitehorse is the alternate connector road that connects Copper Ridge, Ingram and Lobird Trailer Park to the south Alaska Highway.  The condition of permafrost along the Hamilton Boulevard stretch has been monitored since 2013. A geotechnical study of the road recommended that the affected area be surfaced with gravel only to allow the ice to melt completely. An assessment of annual surveys of road elevations showed that in 2019, the settlement of the road had slowed considerably. It indicated that permafrost had thawed from beneath the road embankment to the point where reconstruction is now possible.            Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136matthew.cameron@gov.yk.ca Bonnie Venton Ross 	Communications, Community Services 	867-332-5513bonnie.ventonross@gov.yk.ca Myles Dolphin 	Manager, Strategic Communications 	City of Whitehorse 	867-689-0515myles.dolphin@whitehorse.ca     News release #:   20-230    Related information:   City of Whitehorse construction notice         "

The Government of Yukon will also consider requests from students beyond the usual eligibility requirements for bus travel, based on available space on buses in the following order of priority: Kindergarten to Grade 3 students; Grade 4 to 7 students who live within 3.2 kilometres of their attendance area school; students who attend school outside of their attendance area; and special requests, including busing to stops other than from home to school and back. Families are being directly notified if they can be accommodated on the school bus at the start of the school year. As the school year starts, we will be monitoring our bus services and identifying where we can make adjustments to ensure we continue to accommodate as many students as possible and families will be updated as spacing becomes available. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and the Department of Education continue to encourage families to transport students between home and school this year if possible by arranging for students to walk, cycle, drive or carpool. This will allow more space on the bus for students who do not have another way of getting to school. High school students are encouraged to register for a City of Whitehorse transit pass and ride City transit instead of the school bus if possible, to help accommodate students who cannot take city transit on the school bus. City transit passes also provide flexibility for students who will have different schedules than normal this school year. The Department of Education will continue to provide city bus passes to students who request them. Families that have alternative transportation to school are asked to de-register for the school bus by contacting the Student Transportation Officer at student.transportation@gov.yk.ca.             We are excited to welcome students and staff safely back into the classroom, where students are face-to-face with their teachers and learning alongside their friends. Everyone will have new health and safety routines to learn in the first few weeks and we will continue to adapt to meet the needs of students over the course of the school year. Thank you to principals, educators, staff, public health officers, school councils, Yukon First Nations and our education partners for all their efforts and work over the summer to bring students safely back to school.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            In COVID times more than ever, it takes a community to raise and to educate a child. My thanks go to all who have devoted hundreds of hours into the researching and writing of health and safety guidelines, the busing plans and the operational plans to enable kids to be back into schools. We all know how important for our children return to school, and for teachers and staff to feel informed, safe and supported. That would not be possible without the people behind the scenes.      Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley             Quick facts       August 20 is the first day of school for Whitehorse students. Rural schools start on different dates between August 19 and September 1.  Rural school students in Kindergarten to Grade 12 and Whitehorse students in Kindergarten to Grade 9 will return to full time face-to-face classes five days a week. Whitehorse students in Grades 10 to 12 will attend face-to-face classes for half the school day five days a week and learn away from school for the other half of the school day.  School operations over the course of the pandemic are guided by the health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings. Student learning over the course of the pandemic is being guided by the Yukon Learning Continuity Requirements, including building skills through blended learning.  The COVID-19 student learning survey results were published on August 7 and are guiding staff as they continue to plan and adapt learning and ongoing instruction for students into the 2020–21 school year.  To support assigned seating, students will be provided a school bus pass on the first day of school that will include their school bus number. Students will be required to show their school bus pass when they get on the school bus.  Requests to ride the school bus to a location other than home or school are considered based on the Student Transportation Ridership Guidelines, including if there is enough space on the school bus and if there are available bus routes. These requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The priority for busing is students travelling between home and school.

The Government of Yukon is working with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority to install a new system that will make it safer and faster to manage and screen baggage. Construction on the new system will begin this week and a temporary baggage screening system will be in place by September. The temporary system will require passengers to carry their baggage through the terminal a short distance to a separate baggage drop after check-in. Additional support will be available for any individuals requiring assistance. While the new system is being installed, passengers are advised to arrive at the airport earlier than normal before a flight to accommodate for changes in baggage screening processes. The new baggage handling system and associated equipment is expected to be installed by March 2021.            Our government continues to invest in modernizing Yukon’s aviation infrastructure. These upgrades to the Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport will improve experiences for visitors and travellers.

Addditional measures introduced to support Yukon licencees during the pandemic include a 50 per cent refund of this year’s licence fee and the deferral of updates to the wholesale price list until October 1, 2020. The Yukon Liquor Corporation has also worked with the Liquor Board to support off-premise licensees, and extend hours and provide additional flexibility in the space and footprint requirements of restaurants.

471,2020-08-05,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/territory-wide-community-wellbeing-survey-launched-week,Government Website,Territory-wide Community Wellbeing Survey launched this week,"           Published 05/08/2020        The Government of Yukon has partnered with the Canadian Index of Wellbeing and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to undertake a comprehensive study of wellbeing in Yukon. As Yukon begins transitioning into Phase 3 of the pandemic response, all Yukoners are being called on to complete the Yukon Community Wellbeing survey to measure territorial wellbeing and better understand the local impacts of COVID-19. The survey opened on Monday and responses will be collected throughout the next four weeks, closing in early September. The results of the Community Wellbeing Survey will provide a territory-wide snapshot of Yukoners’ wellbeing. The survey will generate the needed data to support informed decision making to best meet the unique and changing needs of Yukoners with programs, services and supports tailored to the local context. The COVID-specific questions at the start of the survey will be used to inform next steps in the pandemic response. Ensuring the voices of all Yukoners are reflected through this survey is essential. As a thank you for completing the survey, all respondents will be entered into a draw to receive one of three $500 prepaid Visa gift cards.            While Yukon communities are incredibly resilient, we know that responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on our overall wellbeing. This survey will help us identify some of the unintended consequences of the pandemic and the overall health response so far. This is a chance to hear directly from Yukoners about how things are going during these challenging times, and what we as government can do to improve wellbeing across the territory. I encourage all Yukoners to take the time to complete this important survey, as it will inform how we continue to manage the pandemic in a way that minimizes the impacts on individuals and communities.      Premier Sandy Silver             Through our collective efforts, we have effectively contained the spread of COVID-19 in Yukon, but we know that our success has come with many unintended consequences to our wellbeing, both negative and in some instances positive. This survey and your participation in it is incredibly important. It represents one part of the approach we are taking to monitor the short and long terms impacts of the public health response and the many COVID closures that have been imposed since March. Your voice and your perceptions matter, so please take the time to complete this survey. The feedback we get will be used to inform our next steps in the pandemic response as we continue to keep COVID-19 contained with a minimum of harms to our social and economic wellbeing.      Dr. Brendan Hanley, Chief Medical Officer of Health             We are extremely excited about our partnership with the Government of Yukon as we explore the wellbeing of the residents of Yukon, especially during this challenging time. We know from our work across the country that Canadians place quality of life at the top of their list of priorities for themselves, their families, and their communities. Beyond the economy, Canadians’ wellbeing is a function of many aspects of their lives, such as their connections with others, their sense of belonging, the benefits they derive from their leisure, and the quality of their environment. The results of the survey will provide insights into where inequities of wellbeing exist in the lives of Yukoners so that steps can be taken to ensure that everyone can thrive.       Canadian Index of Wellbeing, University of Waterloo, Director Dr. Bryan Smale             Quick facts       The Canadian Index of Wellbeing model and the Community Wellbeing Survey helps Canadians plan for a better and more sustainable future by offering a rigorous and academically-grounded framework that measures social progress and wellbeing using a collection of indicators that are tracked across the country.  Results of the survey will be shared later this fall and a final Profile of Wellbeing in Yukon report will released in early 2021.  The data from the Community Wellbeing Survey can be used by many different organizations for a variety of purposes, including evidence-informed planning, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for residents, in measurable terms.

COVID-19 case count As of today, August 5, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count is 14. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,769 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. Additional information stations set up in Beaver Creek and Watson Lake To support the government’s COVID-19 response, the visitor information centre in Watson Lake and the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre will be closing on August 6. The visitor information centre in Beaver Creek will be closing on August 9. Staff from these three facilities have been reassigned to work out of information stations at Yukon’s land and air borders where they will provide visitors with COVID-19 resources and information about how and where to travel safely, respectfully and responsibly in and through Yukon. Information stations are located at the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) border station outside of Watson Lake, the Canada Border Services Agency station in Beaver Creek, the top of Robert Service Way and at the airport in Whitehorse. The Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre will be continuing online programming throughout the summer and fall. Details and information are available on Facebook and at Beringia.com. Changes to guidelines for bars, pubs and lounges Updated guidelines for bars, pubs, lounges and nightclubs mean that music, including singing and wind instruments, is now permitted if requirements are met. These include a physical distance between musicians and patrons. Karaoke is also permitted for solo performers and musicians and performers must be screened for illness prior to performing. Dancing is still not permitted. Other changes include no self-serve bar service to people. Food and drinks must be delivered to the patron’s designated table. See bars, pubs, lounges and nightclubs reopening guidelines on Yukon.ca. Child care guidelines updated Guidelines for child care services have been provided to all child care and day home operators in Yukon. Parents are no longer required to fill in an assessment tool daily but are reminded to assess their child before delivering them to daycare. See child care centres and family day homes on Yukon.ca. Public notifications Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) is very experienced in contact tracing and determining the need for public notification. When YCDC can identify people who have been exposed, they will contact them directly. This preferred approach protects an individual’s confidentiality while obtaining the needed information. If this is not possible then there are three other approaches. When they have clear detail on locations and time, but not exact information on who may have been present and whether there may have been public mixing, a public notification will be issued. With reliable information that spacing and sanitation protocols are being followed (e.g., at hotels, restaurants or campgrounds) so there is no opportunity for public exposure, these places are not identified as contact locations. With little detail on when and where someone was, but a location, a broader notification is required, which is the least preferred option and only done as a last resort. Visitor decals now available in nine communities People in Yukon with out-of-territory plates can pick up a set of visitor decals at designated pickup points in Whitehorse and nine communities. They must first have completed their 14-day self-isolation period, if it was required. Eligibility requirements are listed on Yukon.ca. In Carmacks, Dawson, Faro, Haines Junction, Mayo, Old Crow, Ross River, Teslin and Watson Lake, decals can be picked up during business hours from the Department of Environment or Compliance Monitoring and Inspections offices. In Whitehorse, decals can be picked up at the Emergency Measures Office, Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. A visitor decal indicates that the occupants are not required to self-isolate and the vehicle is authorized to travel in and around Yukon. One decal will be placed on the driver’s side of the windshield and the other will be displayed at the back of the vehicle. Enforcement statistics Since April 29, 32,104 travellers have entered or passed through Yukon. Of those, 6,067 were Yukoners, 4,115 were from BC and 14,100 were non-residents transiting through the territory. So far, Yukon has issued 123 visitor decals for non-residents. The Government of Yukon Emergency Coordination Centre received 526 complaints since April 29. So far, six people have been fined for violating the Civil Emergency Measures Act.

A previously scheduled Professional Development day on October 1 for the Yukon Teachers’ Association Fall Conference is being moved to August 19 for Whitehorse schools. This will complement a Professional Development day already scheduled for August 18. These Professional Development days will ensure teachers and school staff have appropriate time to review the health and safety guidelines for schools and any adapted school routines at their schools. Rural schools are also being provided a Professional Development day for health and safety training. Any updates to the school calendar for rural schools will be shared directly with school communities by August 12.

476,2020-07-31,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/opioid-death-toll-rises,Government Website,Opioid death toll rises,"           Published 31/07/2020        Concern continues to rise around the number of opioid related deaths in Yukon. Since January 2020, 13 individuals have died as a result of drug overdoses, 11 of which can be directly linked to opioids. The numbers were jointly released today by Yukon’s Chief Coroner Heather Jones, Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley and Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost. The announcement comes with a caution to all drug users to be extremely cautious in what they are using and who they are buying from. In May this year, the coroner and Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health issued a first warning, advising individuals not to use alone and to ensure they have a naloxone kit readily available.   There are currently plans under way to expand drug testing and explore the possibility of a supervised consumption site in Yukon.            These deaths are heartbreaking. With each death, our community loses a son or a daughter, a neighbour or a colleague. People need to be aware about the dangers of illicit drug use and know that opioid use does not discriminate. This is a complex problem that we need to address as a community. This includes working to reduce the stigma around people who use drugs, which remains a significant barrier that prevents individuals, families and communities from getting help.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Given the number of deaths in only seven months and the continued efforts we have undertaken to caution people, we have reached another level of crisis. We have to think differently about how we meet the needs of this segment of our population to keep them safe and to keep those at risk alive.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            This recent spike in opioid related deaths is seen as a tragedy by Yukon Coroner’s Service. Each death represents deeply rooted networks within our communities and the impact has been massive. We must move forward with renewed compassion and face this as the crisis it has become.      Yukon Chief Coroner Heather Jones            The foremost objective of Yukon RCMP is to keep Yukoners safe, particularly our most vulnerable population. While enforcement is a key component in keeping our community safe from drug traffickers, it can only go so far. This is a bigger issue beyond simple law enforcement that requires a community approach that also includes prevention, education and harm reduction.      Yukon RCMP Commanding Officer, Chief Superintendent Scott Sheppard             Quick facts       Opioid Treatment Services at the Referred Care Clinic located on 210 Elliot Street, does not require a referral; anyone can access these services, which include strong social supports.

Permit Hunt Authorization (PHA) lottery The final list of permit holders is now available online. Forty-four permits were returned. The Government of Yukon completed five rounds of the reissuance process and is pleased to have issued all permits. In total, there were 6,079 applications for 270 PHA permits covering six species. Statistics for the 2020 PHA lottery are now online showing the distribution of years applied and the number of applications for each hunt code, for each species. Hunting during COVID-19 All hunters must follow the latest orders and recommendations from the Chief Medical Officer of Health when planning their hunt, including the guidelines on travel to Yukon communities. The most up-to-date information is available online at Yukon.ca/covid-19. Hunters are also encouraged to follow the travel advisories from First Nations governments and communities on the Council of Yukon First Nations website. Harvest reports and mandatory submissions For most species, hunters report their harvest no later than 15 days after the end of the month in which the animal was taken. Hunters are encouraged to report their harvest by calling Client Services at 867-667-5652 or toll free in Yukon 1-800-661-0408, ext. 5652 during regular business hours. When calling, hunters will receive further guidance on how to submit any mandatory biological submissions.

This online service is not monitored evenings, weekends or on statutory holidays. For dangerous wildlife encounters and other situations that need immediate assistance, call the TIPP line at 1-800-661-0525. Hunt respectfully We remind all hunters that conservation and cooperation should be a priority when out on the land. No matter where you hunt in Yukon, you are on a First Nation’s or Inuvialuit traditional territory. Respect the land, other hunters and the wildlife that is being harvested. Keep a clean camp, pack out what is brought into the backcountry, stay on established trails and don’t use cabins without permission. Get the new hunt wisely guide Hunters are encourages to get a copy of the Yukon hunting regulations summary booklet. New this year is the hunt wisely guidebook, which includes hunter ethics, essential gear, firearm safety, field dressing methods and more. Copies of both booklets are available online or at any Department of Environment office.            Hunting is different during COVID-19. Hunters need to take additional precautions to be sure they are travelling safely through Yukon communities and to follow the Safe 6. We recognize that being outdoors and connecting with the land is important for our mental and physical health, particularly during this pandemic. I wish all hunters a safe and successful hunting season.

Family violence, substance use and child maltreatment may have increased within families due to an array of factors such as the reduction in child care, social isolation and general anxiety due to the pandemic. To support families who may feel overwhelmed by the new demands, CYFN and the Government of Yukon are promoting their services in a joint advertising and social marketing campaign. One ad depicts members of a six-person household who are doing their best to cope while staying at home. It invites families to call CYFN’s Family Preservation Services or the Government of Yukon’s Family and Children’s Services to find out what supports are available. A second advertisement depicts two children huddled outside in the dark, while their parents can be seen consuming alcohol and arguing inside. In this case, the ad invites community members to call Yukon Family and Children’s Services if they are concerned for the safety or well-being of a child or youth. The ads are a result of ongoing collaboration between CYFN and the Government of Yukon’s Family and Children’s Services on child-welfare reform in Yukon.            The COVID-19 pandemic has created a number of new challenges for Yukon First Nations families and communities. The Council of Yukon First Nations recognizes these challenges and we want to ensure our most vulnerable people are supported.      Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston            These are difficult times for many Yukon families, but please remember that you are not alone and that supports are available to help you cope. And we also want to remind Yukoners that caring for children and youth is a collective responsibility, if you have concerns about a child in your community, please share them with us.

This will be the longest of the stages, lasting until a vaccine is developed, and will involve a gradual easing of restrictions for Yukoners. Starting on August 1, Yukoners can increase their household bubble from one additional family by adding three to five families depending on family size. The maximum number of individuals in a bubble should be 15 people. Members of this bubble can interact without having to physically distance.   Indoor social gatherings remain limited to 10 with social distancing, unless it is with people that are part of your social bubble. Outdoor gatherings remain at 50. However, Phase 3 allows for planned, seated events in rented spaces with a maximum of 50 people as long the rules of the rental venue are followed. Seated outdoor events with 100 people, such as weddings, will also be allowed. Yukon athletes will be able to return to play as part of Phase 3. Officials with the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s office will meet with sports organizations and officials to plan a safe return to sports activities this fall. More details will be shared as they become available. The transition to Phase 3 is enabled through meeting the indicators outlined in A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for safely lifting COVID-19 restrictions. The Government of Yukon, based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, will continue to evaluate the overall risk to Yukoners when determining when to further ease restrictions throughout Phase 3, including travel restrictions.            We are on track to enter Phase 3 of our Path Forward plan on August 1. This would not have been possible without the incredible effort from Yukoners who are doing their part to take precautions to protect themselves and their friends, families and neighbours. I strongly urge all Yukoners to continue to practice the six steps to staying safe. Our government will continue to take a measured approach to lifting restrictions in Yukon, based on advice from Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health.      Premier Sandy Silver            Our community actions have helped us get to where we are able to enter Phase 3 on August 1. This will be a long phase and we will continue to move slowly. With continued support from citizens and continued adherence to the Safe Six, we will be able to keep moving forward towards our new normal.

The new banking service contract with CIBC will ensure continued banking services in communities around Yukon that would otherwise not be served by commercial services. The Government of Yukon is working with both TD Bank and CIBC to ensure there will be minimal disruption of service in communities. The transition will occur throughout communities between September 28 and October 15. While community banking services will transition to a new provider, many community users will not need to change accounts or institutions as many services can be provided regardless of the institution. Business and government entities can expect the same level and type of service that currently exists.            Banking services are essential to community residents, First Nation and municipal governments, local businesses and tourists. Having reliable and convenient access to banking services ensures Yukoners in communities can take care of personal financial matters and be part of the economic growth of the territory.      Minister of Finance Sandy Silver            CIBC is pleased to be appointed to serve these Yukon communities. Since opening our first branch in Dawson City in 1898, we have been proud of our deep relationship with the people in Yukon. We look forward to providing banking services to First Nations governments and local governments, businesses, community organizations and citizens.​      CIBC Northern Canada Region Head Chris Giulekas            Quick facts       The communities affected and their expected date of transition to new provider will be:  Beaver Creek on September 29, 2020; Burwash Landing on September 28, 2020; Carmacks on October 1, 2020; Faro on October 7, 2020; Haines Junction on October 2, 2020; Mayo on October 6, 2020; Pelly Crossing on October 1, 2020; Ross River on October 8, 2020; Teslin on October 9, 2020; and Old Crow on October 15. 2020.  Minimizing disruption to communities and individuals is one of the main focal points for this transition. The look and feel of the services may be different, but the same services, location, days and hours open will remain the same.  The changes will be staggered across the communities and will be communicated in advance to affected communities.  CIBC currently operates full-service banking centres in Whitehorse, Dawson City and Watson Lake.

As part of this funding Air North will receive approximately $1.06 million over three months. This will help offset the costs of maintaining five weekly flights to Vancouver and three weekly flights on the northern routes to Dawson City and Old Crow. Alkan Air will receive approximately $140,000 in connection with the provision of medevac services from April to June. This funding will ensure that essential transport links to the South and North are maintained without disruption while the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to affect the aviation industry. Yukon aviation businesses will also continue to benefit from the waiving of commercial fees, including: land lease and licence fees; building lease and licence fees; air terminal building concession fees; aircraft fuel lease and licence fees; aircraft fuel concession fees; parking stall fees; and service recoveries like charges for electricity. These fees are waived from April 1 until December 31, 2020.             Airlines continue to be deeply impacted by health and travel restrictions brought about by COVID-19. Our government is committed to supporting Yukon’s airlines to keep our communities connected. This ensures air carriers can continue to provide services that Yukoners rely on, including essential goods and medical supplies, and the transport of medical personnel to and from Yukon.

484,2020-07-27,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/fortymile-caribou-herd-summer-hunting-opportunity-opened,Government Website,Fortymile caribou herd summer hunting opportunity opened,"           Published 27/07/2020        The Government of Yukon is opening a limited licensed harvest on the Fortymile caribou herd from August 1 to September 9, 2020 for Yukon resident hunters. This is the second hunting opportunity for licensed Yukon resident hunters after 25 years of Fortymile caribou herd recovery efforts between the Government of Yukon, Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board, Dawson Renewable Resources Council and Alaska. The herd has now recovered to a population that allows for a sustainable, managed harvest that is in line with long-term conservation efforts. Opening harvesting opportunities now, when the population is numerous, is vital for maintaining the herd’s health as well as the ecological health of the range it lives on. To be eligible for one of 160 permits, hunters must have a valid Yukon big game hunting licence and a caribou seal. Hunters who have already reached the bag limit of one caribou for woodland caribou this hunting season from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 are not eligible to obtain this permit. Permits will be available from Department of Environment offices starting on July 30. Additional rules and requirements for the hunt are available online.            Recovering the Fortymile caribou herd has been a long journey, with many ""firsts"" to celebrate along the way. We extend our best wishes to those Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in citizens and families participating in the first Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in community hunt. We are also pleased to be able to offer harvest opportunities for licensed hunters this summer. During COVID-19, hunters must take extra precautions and follow the latest public health recommendations to ensure a safe and responsible hunting season.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       During the 2020 winter hunt of Fortymile caribou, 66 permits were issued to licensed Yukon hunters and resulted in a harvest of 14 caribou.  Similar to the winter hunt, permits will be valid for five days and will be issued at intervals. For example, August 1 to 5, August 6 to 10 and so on. Twenty permits will be available for each interval.  Hunters must report the results of their hunt whether or not they are successful. If successful, they must also submit the caribou’s incisor bar within 72 hours of the permit end date.

The guidelines will help schools plan for the return of students to classes for the 2020–21 school year. Department of Education central administration staff are working with school principals and school staff to finalize school operational plans and adapt their school routines based on these health and safety guidelines. School principals will share finalized school operational plans with school communities by August 12 before the start of the 2020–21 school year. Health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings  School operations are being adapted based on the health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings, including ensuring:  safe spacing in classrooms and common areas; proper cleaning and disinfecting of the school and high-touch areas and equipment; students and staff know when and how they should clean or sanitize their hands; safe handling of food and use of water fountains; processes are in place if a students or staff gets sick or show symptoms; and students and staff know to stay home if they are sick or show symptoms. Health and safety guidelines for school bus operations School bus services are being adapted based on the health and safety guidelines for school bus operations, including: maintaining physical distance of two metres when waiting for the bus; loading students on the bus from back to front, and offloading students from front to back to support physical distancing; seating students at a two-metre distance from school bus drivers; limiting students to two per seat, unless they are from the same household and using assigned seats; ensuring students and bus drivers are washing or sanitizing their hands before and after boarding the school bus; and cleaning and disinfecting buses, including high-touch areas after each trip. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and the Department of Education encourage families to arrange for students to walk, cycle, drive or carpool to transport students to and from school this year, if possible to allow for more room on buses for students without other means of transport.            Our schools and department are working tirelessly to have students return to school. These guidelines will inform ongoing planning to ensure face-to-face learning opportunities to protect the health and safety of students and staff. I want to thank all our education partners who have worked hard to adapt plans to make sure our students are safe and supported.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee             Careful thought and planning have gone into these health and safety guidelines to enable students to return to in-classroom learning. It is critical that we support our kids’ ability to learn and thrive in a face to face educational environment. The work we have undertaken with Education allows this to happen in the safest manner possible for students and their teachers.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       On July 9, 2020, the Government of Yukon announced preliminary operational and learning planning for Yukon schools for the 2020–21 school year based on the initial health and safety guidance for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings and efforts to support safe spacing in schools:  Rural schools have the flexibility to safely return all Kindergarten to Grade 12 students for full-day, in-class instruction five days per week. Whitehorse schools can safely return all Kindergarten to Grade 9 students for full-day, in-class instruction five days per week. Whitehorse Grade 10 to 12 students will return to half-day in-class instruction and half-day learning away from school five days per week using blended learning with additional support through virtual or in-person study halls with teachers. The Grade 8 students from F.H. Collins Secondary School will move to the Wood Street Centre for the 2020–21 school year and experiential programs will be moved to F.H. Collins and Porter Creek Secondary School.  School preliminary plans have been shared with Yukon First Nations governments and school councils. Yukon First Nations, school councils and education partners will continue to be engaged and their feedback incorporated as planning continues for the 2020–21 school year.  Students will be prioritized for busing in the 2020–21 school year if they are eligible for school busing as described in the Education Act and Student Transportation Regulations and are residing outside of a 3.2 kilometer radius of their school and are enrolled in their attendance area school.

COVID-19 case count As of today, July 22, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count is 13. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,450 people have been tested. Update on the start of Phase 3 Phase 3 is expected to begin on August 1, 2020. The public is reminded that Phase 3 will be a long one, anticipated to take Yukon through until a COVID-19 vaccine is available.  	Initially, changes under Phase 3 will be internal to the territory only. Changes being considered are expansion of family bubbles, gatherings and a return to sport play. Additional changes and relaxation of other restrictions will be considered as appropriate, based on public health principles and level of risk. Expanded testing statistics Testing criteria was expanded on July 15 to include a broader range of symptoms for individuals who have not travelled. This was done in response to and in anticipation of the opening of the border with British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and flu season. Since July 15, 75 tests have been conducted. Testing is happening at Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC), the respiratory assessment centre (RAC) and, in some cases, Whitehorse General Hospital. There have been 170 tests conducted since July 1. Contact tracing emails If someone is named as a contact of a person who has COVID 19, they will be contacted by Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC). Yukoners are encouraged to be on alert for scams related to contact tracing. Any other contact tracing outreach being conducted by anyone aside from YCDC is not valid. Stories are circulating about emails being sent to individuals identifying them as having been somewhere where someone has been diagnosed as positive. The email encourages the recipient to open a document for instructions, which they should not do as these emails are fraudulent. All contact tracing is done directly by YCDC. Visitor decals available for eligible vehicles with out-of-territory licence plates As of July 20, 2020, some vehicles with out-of-territory licence plates will be provided with a visitor decal when they enter Yukon at a border check station staffed by Government of Yukon enforcement officers.

The green visitor decal placed on the driver’s side of the windshield indicates that the occupants are not required to self-isolate and the vehicle is authorized to travel in and around Yukon. People in Yukon with out-of-territory plates can pick up a visitor decal at the Emergency Measures Office located at 60 Norseman Road in Whitehorse. People living in Yukon communities can contact covid19enforcement@gov.yk.ca to request a visitor decal. Eligible visitors must first have completed their 14-day self-isolation period, if it was required. Visitors as well as residents are reminded to be kind, respectful and be safe.

The opening of The Farm Gate, a licensed and inspected poultry operation owned by Cain and Michelle Vangel, marks the first opportunity for Yukon retailers to offer Yukon-raised poultry products in store. The new licensed, privately-owned white meat abattoir facility means producers now have a place where their birds can be processed, retailers now have the ability to purchase inspected poultry to add to their shelves in their store or on their menu and Yukoners can now access Yukon raised poultry products through many different sale points. The first inspected, locally-raised chickens went into the freezers at Bigway Foods in Whitehorse in late June.            The availability of locally-raised and inspected poultry is an important step in developing the capacity of Yukon’s agriculture industry and will increase food security for Yukoners. Congratulations to the Vangel family and The Farm Gate and thanks to Sam Jurovich of Bigway Foods, the Agriculture Branch, and the Animal Health Unit for working hard to bring this to fruition.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            I am happy to be able to provide locally-raised poultry to Yukoners and I‘d like to thank Sam, Nathan and Ash at Bigway Foods for stepping up to carry more locally-raised products in their grocery store. I anticipate this is just the first step in an expansion of choice of locally-raised inspected poultry that will be available to Yukoners in the near future.      The Farm Gate owner Cain Vangel            Our customers enjoy the ability to buy locally grown and raised foods and we are happy to support Yukon farms and processing facilities to deliver the goods that customers are requesting.      Copper Ridge Bigway Foods owner Sam Jurovich            Quick facts       Yukon has a growing red and white meat industry. Since 2016 there has been a 200 per cent increase in the number of inspected animals reaching the retail market. During the challenging times presented by COVID-19, Yukoners have shown their desire to buy local and meat inspection in 2020 is projected to double last year’s numbers.   Both red and white meat inspection requires an inspector to view the live animals, ensuring their pre-slaughter health, and to visually inspect each animal during and after processing. Inspections of abattoir facilities are carried out by qualified Government of Yukon meat inspectors.

Yukon Communicable Disease Control is working closely with the provincial health authority to ensure they are receiving the appropriate care and to coordinate on contact tracing.  All provinces and territories have an agreement to report on the case count based on permanent residency. The most up-to-date information can be found at yukon.ca/covid-19-information.            We were anticipating that we would have cases among Yukoners and these two cases do not change the risk for Yukon. These persons were not infectious while in Yukon. This situation demonstrates that our public health system is working and our partnerships and communication channels with other provincial health authorities are working. These two cases are a reminder that we continue to live with COVID-19. If we maintain the safe six, including proper hand hygiene, physical distancing, small gatherings, staying home when sick and being respectful when travelling, we can keep our families and communities safe.

COVID-19 case count As of today, July 15, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count remains at 11 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,365 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. Border control statistics Our border measures have given us the time to prepare for COVID-19, including enhancing our testing, tracking and tracing capacity. Since the start of Phase 2 on July 1, 1,587 British Columbia residents and 1,130 Yukoners have entered Yukon. In that time, 1,627 people have transited through the territory. The Government of Yukon Emergency Coordination Centre received 119 complaints from the public since July 1.

Government of Yukon working arrangement update During Phase 2 and as we transition into Phase 3, many employees will gradually be returning to the workplace though some will continue to work from home depending on operational requirements and employee circumstances. At the height of employees working remotely, approximately 50 per cent of the government’s workforce was working from home. Currently the percentage of employees working from home is approximately 34 per cent. A gradual return to the workplace will ensure the ongoing health and safety of employees. Health measures adopted during Phase 2 will be instrumental in helping the organization adapt to existing and emerging challenges. Employees who will be returning can expect to have a conversation with their supervisor about the details of coming back into the workplace. Some measures in place include directional tape and signage on the floor and walls, adhering to the six steps to staying safe, including physical distancing, and having less or different access to communal spaces such as kitchens. Whitehorse Public Library to reopen to public The Whitehorse Public Library will reopen its doors to the public on July 21, 2020.

Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley, working with Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC), has released expanded testing criteria. With the reopening of the territory to other provinces and territory, interactions with those from outside Yukon will increase. The expansion of the symptoms list will allow for increased testing which in turn will assist with early detection and contact tracing of COVID-19. The expanded list of symptoms includes fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, sore throat, loss of sense of taste or smell, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and muscle aches.            Increased testing will allow early detection and contact tracing which is a critical part of the public health strategy that will help us maintain our goal of case detection and containment.  We now face the challenge of living and managing COVID while recognizing the need to address health and public health in a more holistic way. We will strive to identify cases early by testing the right people in a timely manner and when cases are identified, YCDC and my office will work to manage those persons and their contacts.      Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       Testing of asymptomatic persons is not recommended at this time.  Anyone experiencing symptoms should contact 811 or complete the self-assessment test online.  The testing criteria is now the same for both individuals who have travelled and those who haven’t.

Cultivating Our Future: 2020 Yukon Agriculture Policy is the result of three years of work with Yukon’s agricultural producers, public and First Nations. The vision for the 2020 Yukon Agriculture Policy is to create the right conditions to increase Yukon’s self-sufficiency in food production, produce high-quality products that feed Yukon’s vibrant communities, contribute to the local economy and to leave positive cultural and environmental legacies for future generations. The policy supports the ongoing development of Yukon’s agriculture industry in areas including: accessing arable land for farming; encouraging best management practices on farms; improving land use for agricultural purposes; prioritizing agriculture-related infrastructure development; reducing operating costs and offering agriculture extension services to support farmers and communities; and increasing farm opportunities, including agriculture business development and marketing.            The updated agriculture policy will work hand-in-hand with Yukon’s Local Food Strategy to encourage self-sufficiency in food production, promote the availability of local food to all Yukoners and consider First Nations priorities for land use and developing local food production capacity. The updated policy supports all communities and aspects of the agriculture and local food sectors, including food for people, feed for livestock and food distribution and environmental impacts.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Yukon’s agriculture industry representatives have been working closely with the Government of Yukon for over two years to update and refine a new agriculture policy for Yukon. We are excited about the future of local food production in Yukon and Cultivating our Future: 2020 Yukon Agriculture Policy will be a guiding document in the development of Yukon’s agriculture industry in to the next decade.      President of Yukon Agricultural Association Sonny Gray            Quick facts       Cultivating Our Future: 2020 Yukon Agriculture Policy is Yukon’s fourth formal agriculture policy. The first policy was adopted in 1982 and updates were made in 1991 and 2006. The 2006 Yukon Agriculture Policy was adopted to encourage an agriculture industry that is economically viable, environmentally sustainable and produces high quality and safe food.  There are 142 farms reported in Yukon. Hay production has been the largest portion of Yukon’s agriculture industry in terms of the number of farms, acreage and revenue. Yukon farms also produce vegetables, field crops, berries, meats and a variety of value-added products including preserves and cheese.

The agreement signed between Yukon Energy and Solvest Inc. commits the utility to purchase the renewable electricity generated by the company’s proposed solar project on the North Klondike Highway for the next 25 years. Solvest’s 1 megawatt project is the first large-scale solar project in the Whitehorse area and the second independent power producer to sign an electricity purchase agreement in Yukon. Once constructed, Solvest’s solar array will be the largest solar array operating in the territory. It will generate approximately 1.84 gigawatt hours of renewable electricity each year, about the same amount of electricity used by 153 Yukon homes in a year. Construction is slated to begin in August and completed in November 2020.            As demand for electricity grows, it is important that we increase the amount generated from renewable sources. This local renewable energy project creates jobs and opportunities for Yukon businesses, supports energy self-sufficiency, makes us less vulnerable to changing fuel prices and helps us transition to a clean energy economy. Signing this agreement brings certainty to Solvest as a green economy investor and to Yukon Energy and its customers on the price paid for power over the next 25 years.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Yukon Energy is committed to renewables. By 2030, our goal is to have more than 97 per cent of the electricity generated on the Yukon grid, on average, to come from renewable sources. In addition to the renewable projects we are building on our own, entering into these types of agreements with Independent Power Producers and purchasing locally-owned and generated renewable electricity helps us reach our renewable electricity target and build a sustainable energy future in Yukon.      Yukon Energy Corporation President and CEO Andrew Hall            Solvest is pleased to take a leading role in renewable energy development in Yukon. This project will provide an economically viable example of solar in the North and help encourage further development of renewable energy here and across northern Canada. As a local company, we look forward to working with Yukon government, Yukon Energy and ATCO Electric Yukon to bring this project online and begin supplying Yukoners with renewable energy for decades to come.      Solvest Vice-President Ben Power            Quick facts       There are three approaches to developing an Independent Power Production project: the Standing Offer Program for smaller projects that go through an application process, the Call for Power where utilities seek out larger projects and Unsolicited Proposals where projects are submitted to utilities. This is the first Electricity Purchase Agreement signed under the Standing Offer Program.  Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation owns the 480 kilowatt solar array installed in Old Crow. The renewable energy system will displace the use of diesel to generate electricity in the off-grid community. Once the system is operational, ATCO Electric Yukon will purchase the electricity for the next 25 years.

Tenants living in private non-subsidized market rental housing in Yukon who have lost 30 per cent or more of their income due to COVID-19 are eligible for a grant to help cover rent in July, August and September 2020. Eligible households can receive 50 per cent of median market rent based on unit size: $415 per month for a bachelor, or room in a house; $500 per month for a 1 bedroom; $600 per month for a 2 bedroom; and $800 per month for a 3 bedroom or larger. The grant will be paid directly to landlords on behalf of tenants. This will ensure that landlords, who may also be experiencing lower income as a result of the pandemic, continue receiving partial income from their rental properties and tenants who have had to defer paying rent will have less owing. In June, the Government of Yukon passed a ministerial order that protects tenants from eviction for non-payment of rent if they are under a health protection measure and allowed tenants who deferred rent payments due to income lost due to COVID-19 will have until December 31, 2020 to repay the outstanding amount to their landlord. For new clients who are interested in the program, the COVID-19 Rent Assist program applications for July to September will be available in late July at https://service.yukon.ca/forms/en/rent-assistance-covid19. Existing clients of the COVID-19 Rent Assist program for April, May or June should contact the Yukon Housing Corporation at rentassist@gov.yk.ca or by phone at 867-667-5759 or toll-free at 1-800-661-0408 extension 5759 to find out how to renew their application.            It is important that we continue to support Yukoners who are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This will help tenants who have experienced a loss of income due to the COVID-19 situation and landlords who may not be receiving their rental income. The Government of Yukon will continue to support Yukoners during these uncertain times as we work to keep our territory safe and healthy.      Minister Responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost            Quick facts       The COVID-19 Rent Assist program was originally announced in May 2020 to help landlords and tenants who had lost income due to the COVID-19 situation pay rent during April, May and June.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, July 8 at 2 p.m., the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,306 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20 and our last case recovered on May 1. We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread has occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Weekday updates We update information about COVID-19 cases and tests every weekday on Yukon.ca, except public holidays. The information we publish includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Respiratory Assessment Centre reopens In anticipation of the demand for increased testing as a result of opening Yukon’s borders and in preparation for influenza season, the stand alone respiratory assessment centre reopened on Monday, July 6. The new location is 49A Waterfront Place in Whitehorse and the hours are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. People will still require a referral from 811 Yukon Healthline, a family physician, community health nurse or Whitehorse General Hospital and can arrange a time for testing by calling 867-393-3083. Hospital changes visiting policy Effective July 6, Whitehorse General Hospital changed its visiting policy. All admitted patients are now allowed one designated, and consistent, visitor. All maternity, Emergency Room (ER) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients will continue to be permitted one designated visitor or support person. Patients and clients checking in for blood work, imaging exams, physio or occupational therapy and specialists appointments will not be permitted a support person except in limited circumstances. Screeners will remain in place at all public entrances and will ask about travel history and heath symptoms. Questions about hospital policies or services during the COVID-19 pandemic can be directed to to 867-393-9040. This number is not for medical advice or support. Visitor Information Centres open Five of Yukon’s visitor information centres are now open. The visitor information centres in Whitehorse, Carcross, Dawson City and Beaver Creek opened on July 1 and the Watson Lake centre opened on July 5. Visitors are being provided with the most up to date information from Yukon.ca as well as Council for Yukon First Nations' communities site. Visitor information centre staff are advising travellers to check to make sure that communities are receptive to visitors and providing reminders for people to visit respectfully. The advice applies to visitors from outside Yukon and Yukon residents who may be taking a “staycation” this year. Visit Travel to Yukon communities guidelines: COVID-19 for more information. Six steps to staying safe   The six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

503,2020-07-02,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/tower-bay-dezadeash-lake-closed-all-fishing,Government Website,Tower Bay on Dezadeash Lake closed to all fishing ,"           Published 02/07/2020        Joint release with Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. The Government of Yukon and Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (CAFN) have put regulations in place to close Tower Bay (Gokhtaheen), located on Dezadeash Lake, to angling and subsistence fishing each year from July 1 to August 15. The regulation is the first of its kind in Yukon. It aligns a subsistence regulation under CAFN’s fish and wildlife legislation with the territory’s fishery regulations. The regulation will apply to licensed anglers, CAFN Citizens and Yukon First Nations with consent from CAFN to fish for subsistence on Dezadeash Lake. The closure will protect lake trout that gather in Tower Bay to seek refuge from warm lake temperatures.            The Government of Yukon is proud to work in partnership with Champagne and Aishihik First Nations to put this important regulation in place. Closing Tower Bay for fishing for a period each year will protect lake trout, ensuring the population remains sustainable now and for future generations.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            It is dän k’e – our way – to look after the fish and the lake. We are glad to partner with the Government of Yukon on these regulations.  It is worth sacrificing our subsistence fishing rights at Gokhtaheen today in order to look after the fish for generations to come.       Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Kaaxnox, Dän nätthe äda (Chief Steve Smith)            Quick facts       The Government of Yukon and Champagne and Aishihik First Nations will review this measure in five years to evaluate effectiveness and compliance.  This regulation change was proposed by Champagne and Aishihik First Nations in 2015 during the Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board’s regulation change process. It went through public review in fall 2015 and was recommended to the Minister by the Board in spring 2016.  Champagne and Aishihik First Nations passed its regulation closing the bay in June 2020 based on Citizens’ input through the General Assembly.  Lake trout are a cold water species who thrive in water temperatures between 8°C and 12°C.  Dezadeash Lake is shallow and experiences a high temperature increase in the summer. Due to this, lake trout congregate at Tower Bay because it has cool water inflow. This makes them vulnerable to over-fishing and can push them into warmer waters, which limits their ability to regulate their temperature.

504,2020-06-30,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/community-safety-plan-developed-whitehorse-emergency-shelter,Government Website,Community safety plan developed for Whitehorse Emergency Shelter,"           Published 30/06/2020        A new Community Safety Plan for the Whitehorse Emergency Shelter and surrounding community has been developed with help from Public Safety Canada. In partnership with key local stakeholders, the Government of Yukon worked with Public Safety Canada and its community safety planning process to develop the plan in the context of the shelter. This process advocates a community-based approach to identify ways to address safety concerns, while remaining focused on serving Yukon’s vulnerable community members. The Community Safety Plan identifies four key priorities that will enhance the shelter’s commitment to providing a safe place for those experiencing homelessness, while also being responsive to the concerns of local residents and businesses. These priorities are: Ensuring the safety of shelter clients, drop-in guests and staff; Enhancing the shelter's strategic and operational governance; Creating a safe and harmonious neighbourhood for shelter clients, and neighbouring residents and businesses; and Ensuring that clients can access culturally-based programs, services and other supports that identify and remove barriers to wellness, healing, education, employability, self-sufficiency, and cultural and community inclusion. The safety plan includes 14 high-level goals and 26 specific actions that are meant to achieve the goal of an emergency shelter that is safe, responsive to the needs of vulnerable citizens, and respectful of those who reside or work in the immediate vicinity. The Government of Yukon is currently reviewing the safety plan and its recommendations. Some of these actions have already been implemented and several more are in development. A committee will be established to oversee the ongoing implementation of the plan, which will continue to apply harm reduction principles and practices to the delivery of services at the shelter.            Our government looks forward to working with all of our valued community stakeholders, local businesses and neighbours in using the Community Safety Plan as guide to help us address collective neighbourhood concerns. We are committed to working with our partners to create a community that helps all members thrive. The actions in this plan will help us provide the best supports possible to clients while addressing concerns of the downtown Whitehorse community. Working together, with open minds and a spirit of partnership that focuses on how best to support those most in need, we believe that we can better address the complex health and social needs in our community.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost           Backgrounder   Addressing safety concerns Exterior renovations to the shelter are underway that will help to immediately address some of the ongoing safety concerns. A six-foot fence has recently been installed along the west side of the shelter, which will deter guests from accessing the back of the facility. Seven specially designed benches and planter boxes are being installed along the Alexander Street side of the shelter. These benches will provide more useable space for shelter guests and a safer place to congregate. The benches are movable, so they can be removed if necessary. Enhanced and integrated health services The Department of Community Services has stationed an EMS Paramedic at the facility, 10 hours a day seven days a week. Since January 2020 more than 1200 interactions with shelter clients have been attended to by these paramedics. The Whitehorse Emergency Shelter has partnered with Mental Wellness and Substance Services to provide psychiatric nursing and mental wellness counselling and social supports to guests, as well as enhanced integration with the Referred Care Clinic (RCC) through a shared outreach nurse to ensure access to a suite of integrated supports and improved access to primary care. Increased programming and support services In 2019 Health and Social Services added two new positions: a social worker and an outreach worker, to support facility guests and connect them to available resources. On-the-land and recreational programming with a First Nations focus has been offered since 2019. A major emphasis has been on guest-led programming and activities. The department of Health and Social Services will continue to work with its government and NGO stakeholders to look at developing further programs and activities. Increased client involvement A Guest Advisory Committee was created in summer 2019 to provide Health and Social Services with advice and recommendations about programming and services. This work is currently being reinvigorated, with a focus on developing peer-based employment opportunities, along with establishing the overall framework for how best to engage guests and peers. Information sharing The shelter has launched a newsletter that highlights activities and programming happening at the facility, and provides some general information to the community on operations. COVID-19 response Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic staff at the Whitehorse Emergency Shelter have been working diligently on measures designed to prevent the potential spread of the virus within the facility and among its guests. This time last year, there were an average of 55 to 65 overnight guests per day. The overnight shelter numbers for May 2020 ran from 18 to 39 guests per day. Key measures include: Screening overnight shelter guests for COVID-19 symptoms at intake. A detailed set of operational guidelines for this screening process has been developed. Ten housing units on the facility’s third floor are being held as future isolation units for guests or shelter users diagnosed with COVID-19. Since late March, guests who require minimal supports have been moved into temporary off-site accommodation, to reduce the number of people staying overnight. On-site dining for dinner has been restricted to overnight shelter guests only. A to-go meal option is being provided to all shelter guests at the Whitehorse Food Bank. We have taken measures to reduce the number of people in the shelter at one time, while ensuring that vulnerable people have a place of respite and a place to connect to health and social supports, if needed. Increased on-site cleaning staff are providing 16 hours a day of continuous cleaning services, which meets or exceeds Canadian disinfection guidelines. Shelter beds and mattresses are disinfected daily.

Individuals entering the building or the airport terminal will be required to wear a non-medical mask or face covering. This is in addition to the measures announced by Transport Canada on April 20, 2020. As travel restrictions begin to lift, an increase in airport traffic is anticipated throughout the summer months. These additional protective measures will help slow the spread of COVID-19 and ensure passengers and airport staff are able to maintain the same level of safety obtained from physical distancing, particularly at crowded sections such as security checkpoints and check-in lines. It is advised that people only enter the airport if it is absolutely essential. Yukoners are encouraged to use the free parking or the cell-phone waiting lot when picking passengers up.      Quick facts       Wearing a mask alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19. All Yukoners must strictly adhere to good hygiene and public health measures such as frequent hand washing and physical distancing.    Non-medical face masks or face coverings should: allow for easy breathing; fit securely to the head with ties or ear loops; maintain their shape after washing and drying; be changed as soon as possible if damp or dirty; be comfortable and not require frequent adjustment; be made of at least two layers of tightly woven material fabric (such as cotton or linen; and be large enough to completely and comfortably cover the nose and mouth without gaping.

Phase 2 will begin July 1 and includes significant changes to border control measures. Beginning tomorrow, residents of Yukon, British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut can enter Yukon without having to self-isolate. To do so, they must provide valid identification proving they are a resident of one of those four jurisdictions and declare they have not travelled outside of those locations in the previous 14 days. Yukon’s borders will also open to the rest of Canada starting tomorrow, but with strict public health measures in place, including the need to self-isolate for 14-days. Some Canadian residents may be exempt from the self-isolation requirement, such as critical workers and individuals transiting through Yukon. Enforcement officers will continue to be stationed at Yukon border checkpoints to advise travellers of their obligation to self-isolate, and provide information on how to safely transit through Yukon. The transition to Phase 2 is made possible by the continued downward trend in COVID-19 cases nationally and enhanced health care capacity locally. The start of Phase 2 is also supported by new and revised sector-specific guidelines for businesses and restaurants, vulnerable populations and many more. A complete listing of all published guidelines and recommendations related to staying safe or operating a business in the territory during COVID-19 can be found by visiting Yukon.ca.            Thanks to the precautions taken by Yukoners over the course of the pandemic so far, we are in a position to enter Phase II of our Path Forward plan and continue to lift restrictions. Our goal as a government remains to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Yukon and to protect the health and safety of Yukoners. We have published dozens of guidelines and recommendations so businesses, organizations, and all Yukoners know how to operate safely during the pandemic. We are confident in the measures we have in place to protect our most vulnerable citizens and also know Yukoners will continue to do their part by practising the Safe Six.      Premier Sandy Silver            Tomorrow brings a new challenge for all of us; to adapt to a world where, COVID-19 is a fact of daily life. Since the gates shut in March we have been able to fend off outbreaks and kept the numbers of cases to a minimum. We have kept our seniors and our vulnerable populations safe. We were able to take the time to learn about COVID-19, learn from others and prepare our defences. I am confident we are prepared to meet this new challenge of living with COVID-19 while progressively restoring our overall health.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       As of July 1, residents of Yukon, British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut can enter Yukon without having to self-isolate if they can provide ID proving their residency, and confirm they have not been outside those four jurisdictions in the past 14 days.  These jurisdictions have implemented public health measures that have shown good results in stemming the spread of COVID-19. The self-isolation exemption list can change based on COVID-19 case counts, outbreaks, and risk mitigation measures.  As of July 1, all remaining residents of Canada may enter Yukon as long as they self-isolate for 14 days upon entry. Some may be exempt from the self-isolation requirement, such as critical workers and individuals transiting through Yukon.  There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Yukon since April 20, 2020. In total, Yukon has seen 11 cases of COVID-19, all of which have recovered.  Until there is a vaccine or effective and accessible treatments are identified, measures will need to remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.  The Safe Six are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10 indoors and 50 outdoors; limiting travel to rural communities and being respectful when you’re there; and self-isolating if you’ve just returned to Yukon from anywhere other than British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut.

Also from July 1, residents of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut will be allowed to enter Yukon without needing to self-isolate for 14 days, as long as they travel directly to Yukon from one of the territories or through BC. The decision to ease border restrictions was made based on careful risk assessments and confidence in the territory’s health care capacity and ability to contact trace if new cases arrive in Yukon. Resources for vulnerable populations To help Yukoners at risk during this pandemic, vulnerable populations can now access mental health and social supports online. This includes homeless people, those experiencing or at risk of gender-based violence, people with disabilities, seniors and those with underlying medical conditions. Pools to reopen Effective July 1, public pools will be able to operate with an approved operational plan. Swimming and other water-related activities are excellent ways to get the physical activity needed for a healthy life. The use of public pools is considered a low-risk activity as long as pools are operated safely and are properly maintained. All requirements in the Public Pool Regulations, under the Public Health and Safety Act, must be adhered to. An operational plan must be submitted to COVID19info@gov.yk.ca and there must be a pre-opening public pool inspection. Pool operators throughout the territory have been advised of this information. Farmers market  Beginning July 1, Yukon farmers' markets can welcome non-food vendors (such as artisans and soap and flower sellers). Information booths will continue to be excluded. In addition, market organizers have been advised they now have the ability to offer seating and an outdoor dining experience to the public as long as physical distancing is maintained. Buskers are also allowed to return to the market beginning July 1.

First Nations truly are the heart and soul of many Yukon communities. This day gives us the chance to recognize their diversity of achievements and ongoing contributions to the vibrant cultural fabric of our territory. In Yukon, each First Nation plays a crucial role in strengthening our systems of governance, economy, culture and education. In 1973, as part of Together Today for our Children Tomorrow, Yukon First Nation leaders called for a university in Yukon. In 2020, the launch of Yukon University, Canada’s first university north of 60, honours that call and breathes life into that vision. Yukon First Nations continue to map the way forward for our territory in a way that benefits all Yukoners. Our government is proud to celebrate Yukon First Nations and Indigenous groups from coast to coast to coast. I encourage all Yukoners to learn more about Indigenous culture, arts, and achievements, and to celebrate this important day with friends and family.

Collins track and field underway,"           Published 19/06/2020        The new running track at F.H. Collins will be closed starting June 23, 2020 while the surface is rubberized. This is the final phase of the F.H. Collins track and field project. Work is expected to be complete so that the track is ready for the 2020–21 school year. Closing the track at this time of year will result in the shortest possible closure. The rubber requires that overnight temperatures stay above 10 degrees Celsius in order for the track to set. The public is asked to stay away from the track during this time to allow for proper installation. Athletics Yukon plans to register the new track to World Athletics standards so that the track may be used for national track and field meets in the future. The facility will be used to host the Yukon elementary and high school track and field championships. In addition to the regulation running track, the new track and field complex will also have steeple chase, long jump, high jump and shotput facilities. The budget for this project is $8.2 million. The Government of Canada contributed over $6 million through the Small Communities Fund from its Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Yukon has contributed $2 million.            Physical activity is key to a healthy, active lifestyle. We’re so excited to see the final phase of the F.H. Collins track underway. This will bring world-class running facilities to our community for the first time and I look forward to athletes of all ages and abilities using it.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            This modernized facility will expand physical education and sport opportunities and enhance the Riverdale Educational Reserve. It will also provide a great venue for community recreation that supports the health and wellness of students, families and all Yukoners.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne Macphee            The athletics facility, with its new rubberized track, is unique in Whitehorse and in Yukon. I am proud to know that our athletes and residents can train and keep fit and healthy at this excellent facility. The Government of Canada recognizes that strategic investments in public infrastructure, including sports and recreation projects such as this, will ensure that our communities remain among the best places to live, work, and raise a family.

The amendments provide a clearer and more comprehensive framework to govern the use of segregation and restrictive confinement. They also establish new independent external oversight and accountability measures for the use of segregation in Yukon’s corrections system. A review adjudicator will be appointed to review segregation placements prior to an inmate being held in non-disciplinary segregation for five consecutive days. Additionally, a review panel will be established to provide oversight in circumstances where an individual has been held in segregation for more than 40 aggregate days. These external review processes are designed to provide independence and ensure that placements are only done in accordance with the circumstances contained in the amended legislation.            These progressive amendments follow the United Nation’s Mandela Rules and align corrections in the Yukon with international best-practices for those in custody. Corrections reform and the safe, fair and compassionate treatment of inmates is our government’s priority.

There are no active cases in the territory and 1,245 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. Full dental services to resume in Yukon Dental professionals may again offer full dental services in the territory beginning on July 1. All dental care except emergency and urgent procedures had previously been suspended due to the pandemic on March 27. The Chief Medical Officer of Health has recommended the resumption of full dental services as part of the territory’s COVID-19 reopening plan, which enters Phase 2 on July 1. Dental professionals will be able to offer non-urgent services, including but not limited to: initial or periodic oral examinations or recall visits; routine dental cleaning and preventative therapies; routine radiographs; extraction of asymptomatic teeth; aesthetic dental procedures; dental implants; restorative dentistry; and non-painful chronic periapical lesions.

As of July 1, all tenants must pay their rent in full as set in their tenancy agreements, unless they are prevented from doing so because they are subject to a health protection measure. Tenants who owe unpaid rent from March 26 to July 1 because of COVID-19 loss of income or after 	June 25, because they were under a health protection measure, have until December 31 to repay the outstanding amount. For people who are subject to a health protection measure such as self-isolation in accordance with the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s instructions, rental protection measures put in place on March 26, 2020 continue. The order also prevents landlords from entering the rental unit of a tenant subject to a health protection measure unless it is an emergency. Additionally, tenants who are not able to pay their rent because of COVID-19 loss of income will still be able to end their tenancy with 30 days’ notice to their landlord. This frees up the rental unit to tenants who are able to cover rent. Tenants and landlords are encouraged to contact the Residential Tenancies Offices for more information by phone at 867-667-5944 or toll-free in Yukon at 1-800-661-0408 extension 5944, or by email at rto@gov.yk.ca A variety of territorial and federal programs are currently in place to support individuals who are experiencing financial impacts as a result of COVID-19. Information about available supports can be found at Yukon.ca/covid-19.            We continue to provide safeguards for tenants who may have to self-isolate and follow health protection orders while the emergency order is in effect. As restrictions lift, we know that it will take time for some businesses to reopen and rehire staff. We hope that with this deadline, affected tenants will have enough time to earn the income to pay any overdue rent.         Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       A health protection measure means any of the following as it relates to a tenant or a member of the tenant’s household and COVID-19: 	  A quarantine of the individual; A restriction on the movement of the person or class of people, to and from the rental unit. A health officer imposes it under the Public Health and Safety Act; A restriction of an individual's movement if it is recommended by or is under the authority of the Chief Medical Officer of Health or the Chief Public Health Officer. It does not include physical distancing; and Hospitalization of the individual.  An Order in Council passed on March 26 prevented landlords from serving their tenants with a notice to end tenancy for unpaid or late rent until the OIC is repealed on June 25.  A tenant who could not pay their rent on time before June 25 because of COVID-19 related job loss or reduced income will have until December 31 to pay the overdue amount.  If a tenant is under a health protection measure after June 25 that prevents them from leaving their home or hospital, they may accumulate additional rent arrears while subject to a health protection measure but must repay it by December 31.   A tenant who has lost their job or had their income reduced because of COVID-19 will be able to end the tenancy with 30 days’ notice.  A landlord will not be able to enter a rental unit if the residents are under a health protection measure, except for reasons of safety.  The Residential Tenancies Office encourages landlords and tenants to agree on how to repay owed rent. If this is not possible, the parties may work with the Residential Tenancies Office to mediate a repayment plan.   Landlords may apply to the COVID-19 Rent Assist program, which offers a grant of up to 50 per cent of the median rent for an equivalently sized rental unit. The program is in place from April to June 2020. A federal program is also available to help landlords pay their mortgages.           Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136matthew.cameron@gov.yk.ca Bonnie Venton Ross 	Communications, Community Services 	867-332-5513bonnie.ventonross@gov.yk.ca     News release #:   20-171    Related information:   Paying rent, loans or mortgage during COVID-19 COVID-19 information        "

COVID-19 case count As of today, June 12, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count remains at 11 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,235 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. State of emergency extended  On the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Government of Yukon is extending the state of emergency under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) for another 90 days, as of today. This will allow the government to continue to use every tool at its disposal to protect the health and safety of Yukoners during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic continues to evolve and there continues to be nationwide transmission of COVID-19, the Government of Yukon is continually evaluating the situation and will adjust measures as necessary. The state of emergency can be cancelled at any time, or can continue to be extended by 90 days so long as the pandemic continues to pose a risk to Yukoners. Violations of the orders under the CEMA are an offence and are punishable by a fine or imprisonment. A full list of the orders and legislative changes made under the Civil Emergency Measures Act can be found at yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19/legislation-changes-covid-19. Guidelines released for visitors at long-term care facilities Outdoor visits for long-term care residents are now permitted with the release of a staged plan for the reopening of long-term care facilities in Yukon to visitors. Currently residents can identify one visitor with whom they can visit in a pre-set outdoor location. The reintroduction of visitors is staged over four phases, similar to the Yukon government’s Path Forward plan. Phase 2 will permit two outdoor visitors at the same time. The territory’s five long-term care homes were closed to all visitors and volunteers on March 16 to avoid introduction of COVID-19 into long-term care homes. In Canada the highest number of deaths is attributed to COVID-19 in nursing and long-term care homes. Bars able to reopen shortly Guidelines for the reopening of bars within the territory have been shared with all proprietors, with the intent of giving them time to prepare for reopening on Friday, June 19. Bars may only open at 50 per cent capacity, the same as restaurants. This is intended to promote physical distancing and limit the size of groups. Groups planning to gather at a bar can be no larger than 10 sitting together. All bars must submit an operational plan to the Health Emergency Operations Centre for approval. Live music will not be permitted at this time and recreation areas such as dart boards, pool tables, dance floors and gaming (such as pinball and video games) are not permitted to open at this time. COVID-19 update As plans for reopening move forward and there is no presence of COVID-19 in Yukon, we are reducing the number of updates. The regular COVID-19 updates will move to once a week beginning Wednesday, June 17, at 2 p.m.      Contact   Aisha Montgomery 	Communications, Community Services 	867-456-6580 Aisha.montgomery@gov.yk.ca Pat Living 	Communications, Health and Social Services 	867-335-1531patricia.living@gov.yk.ca     News release #:   20-170        "

The Yukon Mineral Exploration Program is a funding program designed to support individuals and companies exploring for hard-rock and placer occurrences by shouldering a portion of the risk capital required to explore. The exploration projects funded by the Yukon Mineral Exploration Program are a fundamental step in the early-stage discovery of mineral deposits that can lead to advanced exploration projects and mine development. With this $2.5 million investment by the Government of Yukon the grant recipients will be able to invest more than $8 million in Yukon this season, which will support the economies of Yukon communities.            The Yukon Mineral Exploration Program is key to helping proponents leverage private investment in early stage exploration projects. Our increased investment marks the most funding that has ever been made available through this program in a year when we’ve seen a record number of applicants.  Our government is proud to support local businesses and create jobs for Yukoners at a time when the economy has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       It is the responsibility of applicants to ensure that required permitting is in place and work programs comply with the laws of general application, particularly those related to mining, water, notification, land use and environmental regulations.  All companies and individuals exploring in Yukon are also required to comply with COVID-19 related orders that are in place and to follow guidelines that have been established, including the guidelines for travel within Yukon.

524,2020-06-11,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/recycling-services-resume-across-yukon,Government Website,Recycling services resume across Yukon,"           Published 11/06/2020        Joint news release with Raven Recycling Most recycling services across the territory have now resumed after being suspended since March 30. Raven Recycling and many rural recycling and bottle depots are now open during their regular hours. People are encouraged to contact their local depot to confirm, as some rural depots are still working to reopen as quickly as possible. Free stores remain closed until further notice but textile recycling is available at all depots. Neither Raven Recycling nor any of the rural depots will accept Styrofoam, as there is no viable market for that product. Both Raven Recycling and the Government of Yukon are asking people to practise physical distancing at recycling depots and wash their hands before and after their visit to help ensure the depots stay safe. People with large loads of recycling are encouraged to call their local depot before dropping it off. At Raven, people with large loads or people wanting to donate their refundables to a non-profit of their choice should label their bags with their name, contact information and preferred non-profit for donation, if desired. Raven will call them to let them know when their refund is ready. All refundables left at the donation bin at Raven will be shared with Humane Society Yukon. Raven Recycling conducted a survey of 1,300 Whitehorse residents between April 24 and May 4 and found that 90 per cent of people have been storing their refundables, and 68 per cent of people have been storing their non-refundables. Approximately 30 per cent of respondents said they had thrown recycling in the garbage and two per cent said they had burned it. People who could not store all of their recyclables said they chose which materials to keep and which to throw in the garbage, found ways to reuse things like glass or cartons and tried to reduce.            Thank you to everyone who stored their recycling over the past two months in an effort to keep these materials out of the landfill and thank you to those who will start recycling again now that services are open. We encourage everyone to practise physical distancing and hand washing at the depots so we can keep them safe and open for everyone.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Our temporary closure highlighted the sheer volume of single-use packaging material consumers are forced to deal with. Please voice your support for improvements to how we manage materials, such as tipping fees and producer responsibility programs. Where you can, make the effort to avoid purchasing single-use items, reducing and reusing before you recycle. The satisfaction of reducing your waste is well worth the effort.      Executive Director of Raven Recycling Joy Snyder            Our municipalities appreciate everyone’s patience and cooperation over the past two months. The closure highlighted the value of this service, and our membership is glad to be back offering it to our communities. Please respect the safety of our public works staff and the public by practising social distancing and hand-washing when visiting our recycling centres.      President of the Association of Yukon Communities Gord Curran            Quick facts       All rural depots are open or are working to reopen as soon as possible. Contact your local depot to confirm that services are open before you plan your visit.  Through the month of May, Raven Recycling began re-opening their public drop-off and opened their bottle depot for refunds on May 19. Since June 1, when scrap metal sales opened, all services have resumed.  Tipping fees at Marsh Lake, Mount Lorne, Carcross, Tagish, and Deep Creek will be introduced on August 1, 2020. Find out about tipping fees in rural communities  If you have a large load to drop off, contact Raven Recycling ahead of time at 867-667-7269 or contact your local depot.

As part of A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions, initial health and safety guidance for Kindergarten to Grade 12 schools has been developed with Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health to start planning for changes to the operations of Yukon schools for the 2020–21 school year. Health and safety guidelines will be developed before the start of the 2020–21 school year. Each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet Yukon’s health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 schools while meeting the unique needs and context of school communities. School principals and staff will share this information before the start of the 2020–21 school year.            This has been a challenging time for students and families. We know that the longer we are out of regular routines the more mental health and wellness are affected. Planning is well underway to return our students to school in the fall, knowing that schools will be following new guidelines to protect the health and safety of students, school staff and communities.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            Returning students to classes in school is an important part of our return to Yukon’s new normal. Children need to see their teachers and to be with each other in a healthy learning environment. If carefully planned, schools can be safe places to learn even in the presence of COVID.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       Planning for the 2020–21 school year includes flexibility to reduce the number of students in schools if there is an increased risk of transmission or a second wave of the COVID-19 virus; and to supplement in-person classes with other learning opportunities if needed.  Detailed health and safety guidelines for schools will include requirements for hand washing and personal hygiene practices, cleaning and disinfecting, safe spacing through physical distancing and minimizing physical contact, riding the school bus, managing illness and absences and after school and community use.  Other jurisdictions where students have returned to classes in their schools will also be monitored to learn from and adapt to best practices.  Students will be able to ride the school bus to school with new health and safety guidelines that will be developed. Whitehorse parents/guardians should register their child by visiting yukon.ca/en/bus by June 19. Rural parents and guardians should contact their school directly to ask about busing.  The Government of Yukon released A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions on May 15, 2020 and is on track to enter Phase 2 of the plan on July 1.  On April 7, 2020, the Government of Yukon announced the suspension of face-to face classes in Yukon schools for the remainder of the 2019–20 school year.

COVID-19 case count As of today, June 5, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count remains at 11 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,201 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. Updated guidance for critical and essential service workers released The Government of Yukon’s guidance for critical and essential workers has been updated this week to provide greater clarity to workers delivering critical and essential services in the territory between now and July 1, 2020. After July 1, 2020, restrictions will be eased for critical and essential workers entering Yukon from BC. The updated guidance document clarifies that the restrictions of gatherings to 10 people does not apply to workplaces, that people who need to do urgent repairs or maintenance on infrastructure are considered critical workers, as are judges, witnesses and other individuals necessary to carry out the rule of law. The updated document also clarifies that all of Yukon’s communities – whether Whitehorse or rural – should be treated similarly by people who need to come to Yukon to work from outside the territory. The guidance document is in effect immediately and only applies to the current phase of our approach to the pandemic. Further changes to this document may arise once we enter Phase II of our plan to lift COVID-19 restrictions. Updates to A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions Following the announcement about the anticipated start of Phase II on July 1, Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions has been updated to include specific dates and new timelines. The latest version of the plan can be found online at https://yukon.ca/covid-19 and will be updated periodically as we progress through the phases of the plan. Faith-based services Beginning this Sunday, June 7, places of worship will be permitted to open. Service organizers and attendees are required to adopt steps to ensure physical distancing, even adapting the nature of their services where necessary. This means, for example, that the seating capacity of indoor venues will be limited to one third of the building capacity up to a maximum of 50 people including service leaders and organizers. Leaders and organizers must also increase the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting common, high-touch areas such as seating, railings, switched and ceremonial objects. Organizers are required to complete an operational plan that must be produced if requested. It does not need to be approved in advance. The guidance for faith-based services and activities is now online at Yukon.ca. Mental health resources Yukon has a wide range of mental health support. list of the resources is available on the Yukon.ca website at: https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/mental-wellness-support-during-covid-19 These resources are provided by the Yukon government, First Nations governments, the federal government and the non-governmental organization (NGO) community. The majority of these supports remain available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some services have been altered to comply with the orders and recommendations of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. This list is not comprehensive and the provision of services will change depending on which phase Yukon is at based on the plan for management of the COVID-19 pandemic level in Yukon, including plans to lift restrictions. These resources have been collected and organized by population to make it easier for health care providers, NGOs and anyone supporting the health and wellness of Yukoners, so identify the appropriate resources. Accessing Opioid Treatment Services during COVID-19 Opioid Treatment Services and support are available to anyone who feels a need to discuss or address their opioid use, especially considering the increased stressors many are under due to COVID-19. The medical community is expressing concerns over the lack of safe supply. This may encourage people to seek treatment over fears that the drugs they normally use may not be available or are unsafe to use and that some individuals may be using more at this time as a coping mechanism.  Opioid treatment includes access to prescription medications such as suboxone and methadone used to treat opioid use disorder. If people are unsure if treatment is right for them, they are encouraged to come in and have a conversation with a clinician about what options are available and what treatment might look like. Opioid Treatment Services operate out of the Referred Care Clinic at 210 Elliott Street in Whitehorse. Normally these are drop-in services but because of COVID-19, the public is being asked to call first and make an appointment.

530,2020-06-05,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/applications-special-guide-licence-lottery-open-june-5,Government Website,Applications for Special Guide Licence lottery to open June 5,"           Published 05/06/2020        Yukon resident hunters can apply for a Special Guide Licence (SGL) from June 5 to 18, 2020. A Yukon resident with a valid big game hunting licence who obtains an SGL may guide a non-resident Canadian hunter for moose, caribou or bison. They may also apply for weighting only, which will improve their chances in future SGL lotteries.  All hunters must follow the latest orders and recommendations from the Chief Medical Officer of Health when planning their hunt, including the Travel within Yukon guidelines. Non-residents who are not already in the territory are advised they will need to comply with border restrictions and self-isolation requirements. This year, successful applicants can decline having a licence issued if the non-resident is unable to enter Yukon due to travel restrictions. Successful applicants will be notified by email and must then request their SGL licence to be issued by contacting the Department of Environment. Once a licence is issued, it cannot be returned. Successful applicants should confirm that the non-resident hunter is eligible to enter Yukon in advance of requesting the issuance of licences. If the successful applicants do not request and obtain their licences, both applicants will be eligible to apply for the lottery next year and appropriate weighting will be applied to the resident’s licencing history. There are 125 special guide licences available and hunters can apply online.            Outdoor recreation is important for Yukoners’ mental and physical health and wellness at all times, including during this pandemic. This year’s Special Guide Licence lottery will provide non-residents who are staying with family in Yukon an opportunity to hunt and potentially provide high-quality food for their family. As always, hunters should take only what they need, be respectful of the land and other hunters, and use all that they take, but they should also take extra precautions and follow the latest public health recommendations to ensure a safe and responsible hunting season.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Non-residents who are not already in Yukon need to carefully consider border restrictions. Entry to Yukon is currently only permitted for residents, family members of residents, people delivering critical or essential services, travelers transiting through Yukon to a neighbouring jurisdiction, and people exercising an Aboriginal or treaty right. Non-residents may be denied entry to Yukon.  The SGL lottery application deadline is June 18 at 4 p.m.  Hunting season for moose and caribou opens August 1, 2020. Bison can be hunted in different areas at two times during the fall and winter: September 1 to October 31, 2020, and November 1 to March 31, 2021.

531,2020-06-04,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/support-restaurants-announced,Government Website,Support for restaurants announced,"           Published 04/06/2020        Restaurants and other businesses with a liquor licence are receiving support from the Government of Yukon. Liquor licensees will now receive a discount of 25 per cent off the retail price for liquor. This discount will be applied for the duration of restrictions requiring restaurants to open at half their usual capacity, which began on May 29. Licensees will also receive a 50 per cent refund of this year’s licence fee because of the closure requirements for restaurants and bars. These measures to support Yukon licencees are based on recommendations from the Business Advisory Council. Additional measures to support Yukon licencees include deferring updates to the wholesale price list until October 1, 2020 and temporarily waiving the re-stocking fee for all liquor licensees when returning unsold liquor to the Corporation. The Yukon Liquor Corporation has also worked with the Liquor Board to support off-premise licensees, and extend hours and provide additional flexibility in the space and footprint requirements of restaurants.            Yukon’s restaurants are facing multiple challenges in reopening their businesses. Most have suffered from significant loss of revenue during the last two months. These new measures will help reduce the costs of reopening and support the local economy in these difficult times. I would like to thank the Business Advisory Council for providing constructive suggestions to support Yukon restaurants and their dedicated staff.

This summer, a signalized intersection will be built at the Hillcrest intersection to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists. The contract also includes a new paved multi-use trail along the highway which will connect to the City of Whitehorse’s growing trail network. Additional through lanes and dedicated turn lanes will also be added to improve the flow of traffic and reduce the likelihood of collisions. The Government of Yukon will continue to monitor how these upgrades enhance safety for all road users. Construction is expected to begin in June.            The Alaska Highway is a critical for all of Yukon’s road users and these improvements will substantially improve safety. This contract also provides another example of a local company playing a role in keeping Yukon’s economy on track while improving the lives of Yukoners.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       The Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board has recommended that the Alaska Highway Safety Improvement project be allowed to proceed as proposed.  The project will be completed in three phases. This contract is broken down into two phases.  Phase 1 between Lodestar Lane and Hillcrest Drive will start this June and end in fall 2020. Phase 2 is from Hillcrest Drive to Burns Road and will start in summer 2021 and end in fall 2021.  Phase 3 will take place the following summer as a new tender/contract. The full project (three phases) will be completed in fall 2022.   Uncontrolled road accesses along the highway will also be closed in an effort to improve safety and reduce motor vehicle collisions.

The new acquisitions are the work of Yukon artists Justin Apperley, Audrey and Karrie Brown, Kimberly Edgar, Vashti Etzel, Violet Gatensby, Hannah Jickling and Valerie Salez, Daphne Mennell, Roland Peters, Monika Käte Steputh and Eugene Alfred. The selected works showcase an array of stylistic approaches and themes and represent a wide range of media including carving, photography, painting, beadwork, knife making and even snow shovelling. The pieces were selected through the annual call for submissions process held by the Yukon government and the Friends of Yukon Permanent Art Collection (FOYPAC). Selections were made from 129 submissions by 58 artists. A public exhibition to officially unveil the new artwork will be held this fall.            Each of these 11 new additions to the Yukon Permanent Art Collection represents an important verse in the rich story of visual art in our territory. We are thankful for the gifts of hope and beauty these works bring us in our challenging new reality. Congratulations to the artists on this achievement, and our thanks for adding their voice and considerable talents to this invaluable collection.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys            The annual call for submissions is always an exciting process. The response this year was impressive, and the selected works reflect the diverse skills and unique vision of both emerging and established Yukon artists. This year’s acquisitions are also notable because for the first time since we began the annual call for submissions in 2008, all of the selected artists are from communities outside of Whitehorse. We're excited to welcome these exceptional pieces from throughout our territory into the collection.          Friends of Yukon Permanent Art Collection President Katie Newman            I am thankful that my grandma took the time to pass down her beading skills so that I could create what is now considered an art piece, and am honoured to join both her and my father in Yukon's permanent collection.      Artist Karrie Brown            Quick facts       The new acquisitions were selected by the Friends of Yukon Permanent Art Collection (FOYPAC) through an arms-length adjudication process. FOYPAC is a non-profit society made up of artists, art professionals and community members dedicated to the continued growth of the collection.  Works from the collection are displayed in public areas of government buildings in Whitehorse, Dawson, Faro, Haines Junction and Mayo. They are also periodically displayed in special curated exhibitions produced by Tourism and Culture’s Arts Section or through loans to other institutions.  There are currently more than 450 art works by more than 240 artists in the collection.  The deadline and parameters for the 2021 call for submissions will be announced later this year.

534,2020-06-03,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukon-recognizes-one-year-anniversary-release-national-inquirys-final-report,Government Website,Yukon recognizes the one-year anniversary of release of National Inquiry’s Final Report,"           Published 03/06/2020        Today, June 3, marks the one-year anniversary of the formal release of the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirited individuals (MMIWG2S+): “Reclaiming Power and Place”. The Final Report comprises the truths of more than 2,380 family members, survivors of violence, experts and Knowledge Keepers gathered from two years of public hearings and evidence gathering. It delivers 231 individual Calls for Justice directed at governments, institutions, social service providers, industries and all Canadians. Last year, the Yukon Advisory Committee (YAC) on MMIWG developed a first draft of the Yukon Strategy on MMIWG2S+ based on the National Inquiry’s Calls for Justice, a review of other national and territorial reports, and recommendations from past gatherings of MMIWG2S+ family members. This long-term strategy will represent a whole of Yukon approach, outlining specific action plans and roles for all stakeholders and all Yukoners to play. Minister Jeanie Dendys, as a co-chair of the committee, has engaged with 12 First Nations and five municipal governments to discuss their feedback and participation in the strategy. Unfortunately, the realities of COVID-19 delayed meeting with the remaining First Nations and municipal governments in person, so those meetings will take place virtually. In recognition of the valuable expertise and experience of family members of MMIWG2S+, the strategy will keep the voices of families at the centre. Although a large gathering of family members scheduled for March 21 to 22 had to be cancelled, input into the strategy will still be coordinated through small and virtual gatherings in the coming months.  The final document will then be shared with all stakeholders for signing. The Yukon Advisory Committee had hoped to have finalized Yukon’s MMIWG2S+ Strategy before reaching the milestone of the first anniversary of the release of the National Inquiry’s final report. COVID-19 delayed progress in meeting that goal, but Yukoners should rest assured that the committee is still moving forward with this important work and will create a whole of Yukon strategy that will change the story for Indigenous women, girls and LGBTQ2S+ Yukoners.            It has been an honour to co-chair the Yukon Advisory Committee on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirited individuals, to lead this work and be in a position of leadership in the last few years. I look forward to working with all stakeholders to finalize this strategy and begin the work ahead to create an inclusive and safe community for all Yukoners.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate, Jeanie Dendys            I am excited to be working in partnership with all Yukoners to take a decolonized approach to addressing MMIWG2S+ that puts their families and survivors at the forefront, and highlights the Yukon's greatest strength: working together.        Ann Maje Raider, Liard Aboriginal Women’s Society            There is a need for collaboration in this work. The Yukon Strategy on MMIWG2S+ must be based in our relationships, and strengthened by our ability to rely on each other to identify the problems and solutions together.      Chief Doris Bill, Kwanlin Dun First Nation            Quick facts       The Yukon Advisory Committee originally came together four years ago to support the National Inquiry and the families’ participation, promote information sharing, and plan collaborative action.

Graduation is such an important milestone for every student, their families and their school communities. It is a time to celebrate dedication and achievement in learning. It marks the transition into next the stage of life, continuing to the next level at school, starting postsecondary studies or embarking on a career. As you all know, formal graduation ceremonies have been postponed and Yukon schools are determining when they can safely hold formal cap and gown celebrations. Until then, students, parents, families, principals, teachers, graduation committees, Yukon First Nations and Yukon University have found alternative ways to honour and celebrate the accomplishments of all Yukon graduating students. Thank you all for the community spirit you have shown. Your creativity, ability to adapt and imaginations are a positive example and let our graduates know how much you care.    Yukon Graduate Day is an opportunity for Yukoners to celebrate the accomplishments and success of Yukon graduating students. It allows us to come together to celebrate, support and recognize the incredible resiliency, perseverance and optimism that Yukon students and graduates have shown during their learning journeys. The Government of Yukon is pleased to recognize the many accomplishments of this year’s graduates on Yukon Graduate Day.

Eligible families will receive an additional $250 to $400 per month to help pay for supports, as there has been a significant reduction of services available in the community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Community supports and services that are typically available include schools, day programs and recreation facilities. These facilities are currently unavailable or more difficult to access. Funding can help pay for services such as respite care, child care or housekeeping, or for specialized equipment or supplies. This additional funding will be provided from June to August 2020.            This funding will reduce stress and financial burdens for families supporting children, youth or an adult with a disability who are being disproportionally impacted by the reduction of community support during the COVID-19 crisis. Many of the typical supports families rely on have not been available. This temporary funding will help them through this challenging time.

Premier Silver and Dr. Hanley confirmed that if conditions continue trending positively Yukon is on track to begin Phase II on July 1. Since the transition to Phase I of A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions on May 15, Yukoners have seen a gradual shift in COVID-19 related restrictions. This includes the reopening of personal services, dine-in restaurants opening at 50 per cent capacity and day cares, day camps and recreational centres approved to operate. New guidelines are in place effective today that describe how to travel responsibly within Yukon and respect the wishes of communities and First Nations. Next week, territorial parks and campgrounds will open for the summer. Once the transition to Phase II begins, additional restrictions will be lifted throughout July. This includes lifting travel restrictions between Yukon and British Columbia, which will allow for the free movement of Yukon and BC residents back and forth, with no requirement for 14-day self-isolation. Decisions about how and when to move forwards or backwards through each phase of the plan continue to be guided by careful risk assessments and the six “criteria for transitioning between phases” including community engagement and public health capacity such as the capacity to contact trace and maintain fast testing turn around time. Monitoring the status of the virus in neighbouring jurisdictions will continue to determine if it is safe to further lift restrictions. British Columbia has seen a significant decrease in cases of COVID-19 and continued progress containing the virus and flattening the curve, paving the way for the gradual lifting of some border restrictions. Visit Yukon.ca for regular updates. If you have additional questions, you can email covid19info@gov.yk.ca or call the COVID-19 information line at 877-374-0425 between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. seven days a week.            We recognize the impact that COVID-19 restrictions are having on our physical, emotional and economic wellbeing and are striving to reach the proper balance between public safety and Yukoners’ desire to resume their lives. We are confident in our health care capacity, our ability to test and our ability to track and contain this virus. It is that confidence, and all the skills we have gained in the past two months, that allow us to begin moving into Phase II of this plan.      Premier Sandy Silver             British Columbia has shown great success in managing COVID-19 within the province and based on their epidemiology, and ours, I am confident that this is a safe way for us to progress as we transition out of our cocoon. Looking at our overall health, I believe this is the right choice for the territory.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       All employers are now required to complete a COVID-19 Operational Plan to identify hazards and mitigate risks for staff and the public.  Any organization wishing to have the plans of their event or activity reviewed by public health professionals can submit the details using an online form.  Restaurants can now offer dine-in services with an approved COVID-19 Operational Plan.  Territorial campgrounds will open on June 4.  Yukoners may responsibly travel within Yukon communities as long as they take precautions and respect the wishes of municipal and First Nations governments. You may shop in local stores and buy food in restaurants if they are open for your business.  There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Yukon since April 20, 2020. In total, Yukon has seen 11 cases of COVID-19, all of which have recovered.  If restrictions had not been put in place, Yukon could have experienced upwards of 2,500 cases of COVID-19 according to modelling developed by the Health Emergency Operations Centre.  Until there is a vaccine or effective and accessible treatments identified, measures will need to remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.  The six steps to staying safe are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required.  With no new cases since April 20, Yukon remains one of the least restricted parts of the country. A Path Forward is a gradual and phased approach to easing current restrictions in the territory.

The RAC was established to respond to the need for respiratory illness assessment, high rates of influenza and COVID-19 testing outside of the acute care system and at Yukon Communicable Disease. The centre was open to individuals who had travelled and were experiencing symptoms, and also to members of the general public who were experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness. With physicians’ offices closed to most in-person visits, the RAC was designated as the location for testing.            The RAC currently sees an average of five patients daily, influenza season has peaked and the COVID-19 risk in Yukon is currently low. Therefore, these small volumes of patients can be easily absorbed by the emergency department, with persons with a travel history or contacts still being screened at Yukon Communicable Disease Control. The RAC has effectively supported Yukon’s efforts to assess and test for COVID-19 and limit the spread of infection in the territory.      Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley            Thank you to everyone who worked together to get the Respiratory Assessment Centre up and running so quickly and a big thank you to the front line workers who screened and tested the hundreds of Yukoners who used the RAC. We are lucky in the territory that our public health measures are working. If the RAC is needed again, we are poised to have it set up within one day.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost             Quick facts       The Respiratory Assessment Centre operated out of the Yukon Convention Centre on Fourth Avenue in Whitehorse.  During the 70 days of operation, it assessed more than 400 individuals; more than 225 of those were tested for COVID-19.  Currently we have a total 13 staff, two nurse practitioners and 13 physicians on contract working at the RAC. Daily we have between five to six staff, one nurse practitioner and one physician working.  Individuals who are returning from travel outside Yukon and experience symptoms should contact 811.

All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,159 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread has occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Weekday updates We update information about COVID-19 cases and tests every weekday on Yukon.ca, except public holidays. The information we publish includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Today’s update focusses on the modelling work being done within the CMOH office. Copies of this technical briefing presentation are available here. Single site survey  To address the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission from the movement of staff, volunteers and contractors between certain facilities, such as long term care facilities, and other volunteer and employment settings, the Chief Medical Officer of Health will collect information to identify where there is cross over. As Yukon prepares to shift into a new phase of the pandemic response it, may be necessary to restrict movement of certain employees between facilities and other employment types in order to lessen the risk of COVID-19 transmission in these facilities. The goal of this project is to ensure the continuity of services and to protect the health of residents and employees in facilities, while mitigating impacts on operations and on affected staff. All information is being collected through a secure on-line portal and in accordance with applicable Yukon privacy legislation.

542,2020-05-25,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/statement-minister-tourism-and-culture-jeanie-dendys-national-tourism-week,Government Website,Statement from Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys on National Tourism Week,"           Published 25/05/2020        Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys has issued the following statement to mark the kick-off of the 2020 National Tourism Week. As we mark this year’s National Tourism Week, the tourism industry finds itself facing a new and very challenging global landscape. The past several years of banner growth and development, ground-breaking partnerships and the focused vision of the Yukon Tourism Development Strategy have been an exciting and optimistic time. This has all been interrupted by the global pandemic, but I am so impressed with how the tourism sector has responded to lend a hand. Airlines have safely transported family members home to care for loved ones. Our hotels have housed those who needed a safe place to self-isolate. Restaurants have adapted delivery and pickup services to provide quality meals within the new social distancing policies. This spirit of ingenuity and hospitality is as much a part of what draws visitors from across the world as our incredible wilderness, vibrant culture and fascinating history. This Tourism Week, I ask Yukoners to reflect on the fact that Tourism is Community. Tourism has reliably been Yukon’s largest private sector employer and second-largest economic driver. It fosters cultural appreciation, supports diversity and contributes to rural economic sustainability. It is powered by Yukoners proud of their home and the stories and experiences that live here. However, there is no way around it: for the time being, Yukon is not receiving visitors. We are instead telling travellers both here in the Yukon and from outside the territory to Wait for Someday, and to Explore Yukon Later. But welcoming visitors is intrinsic to who we are as a people. Yukoners always roll out the welcome mat. As our government gradually eases health and travel restrictions and as the tourism sector plans for its recovery, this work will be done in the same spirit of collaboration and engagement that led us to the Yukon Tourism Development Strategy. This values-based plan was built with the following at its core:  Love our Yukon → Encourage a thriving tourism sector → Preserve and enjoy our natural environment → Honour our heritage → Celebrate our cultures → Build healthy communities → Develop partnerships → Foster innovation   As we chart our path forward and navigate the new normal, please join me in celebrating our community and the tourism sector’s significant contribution to our lives here in the Yukon. These are difficult times for tourism, no question, but I know we will rebound stronger than ever, thanks to the talents, skills and pride of our community partners in Yukon’s tourism sector.

It also allows the Government of Yukon to respond quickly and close services if we see a spike in COVID-19 cases or community spread of the virus in the territory. Child care services Licensed child care operators can now provide child care for the children of all Yukon families, rather than only for vulnerable families and the families of critical and essential workers. Child care operators can also return to their pre-COVID-19 enrolment numbers and are now following the new guidelines for operating child care centres during COVID-19. Inspectors are working with child care operators to determine when they can return to their normal licensing capacity. Restaurants From May 29, restaurants can again provide dine-in services, as long as they have developed a COVID-19 operational plan to keep staff and customers safe and the government has approved the plan. Restaurants have been able to continue providing take-out services throughout the pandemic. Personal services Personal services businesses can reopen on May 27 as long as they have developed a COVID-19 operational plan and it has been approved by the government. Personal services businesses include hair salons, barber shops, tattoo parlours, nail salons and non-registered massage therapists. We ask Yukoners to be patient and give businesses the time they need to get ready to provide services again after their complete closure. COVID-19 operational plan template All businesses, service providers and employers need to have a COVID-19 operational plan in place even if they were not mandated to close under the Civil Emergency Measures Act. They don’t need to have the plan approved in order to operate but need to have it available for inspection by the government. The template for COVID-19 operational plans is on Yukon.ca. As and when the government lifts restrictions on types of businesses currently mandated to close under the Civil Emergency Measures Act those businesses must complete a COVID-19 operational plan and have it approved by the government before they can reopen. Recreational programming COVID-19 review form Event planners and recreational programmers should develop a COVID-19 plan and get it approved by public health officials. The online form is on the “Request a review of business, service or event operations during COVID-19 page” of Yukon.ca. Six steps to staying safe   The six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

550,2020-05-19,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/may-19-2020-covid-19-update,Government Website,"May 19, 2020: COVID-19 update","           Published 19/05/2020        Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, May 19, at 2 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,134 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread has occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Weekday updates We update information about COVID-19 cases and tests every weekday on Yukon.ca, except public holidays. The information we publish includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Combined households As from May 15, 2020, the territory is now in Phase 1 of the Government of Yukon’s reopening plan, A Path Forward. This means we can all now choose one other household to join up with and not have to practise physical distancing with people in that household. Once we’ve chosen a household to pair with we cannot change to another pairing. It's acceptable if the number of people in the two households is more than 10 but we must continue to avoid gathering in social groups of more than 10 other than that. We must also continue to keep a physical distance of two metres (six feet) from anyone not in our two households. There’s more information in the combined household guidelines on Yukon.ca. Reopening businesses and services Being in Phase 1 of the reopening plan means that businesses and service providers that weren’t ordered to close may operate as long as they have a COVID-19 operational plan and have put safety precautions in place. Recreational programming such as sporting events and day camps are possible but organizers need to have an approved plan in place. Businesses such as personal services and restaurants that were ordered to close will be able to open up again once they’ve prepared operational plans based on the guidelines we’re developing and had them approved. Restaurants can meanwhile continue to provide take-out and delivery services but must submit an operational plan to the government by May 29. Guidelines for those restaurants planning to restore table service will be available in coming days. All  other employers are also required to complete COVID-19 operational plans and have them available for inspection but these don’t need to be submitted for approval. Businesses, employers and event organizers can find more information about the steps they need to take and where to send their plans for review or approval on the “Operating businesses, services and events safely during COVID-19” page of Yukon.ca. As soon as we complete guidelines we publish them on the “Guidelines and recommendations” page of Yukon.ca. A change to the six steps to staying safe   Now that we’re in Phase 1, we’ve changed our guidance that said avoid travel to communities to instead asking people to limit travel to communities. Communities are particularly vulnerable during the pandemic and we ask Yukoners to travel within the territory as respectfully and safely as possible.  The updated six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required. Moving through reopening phases We’ll make decisions about moving to the next phase of the reopening plan in a gradual, cautious and objective way with at least two to four weeks between each phase. This means we’ll have time to detect changes in the pandemic situation and evaluate the risks of the steps we’ve taken so far and how safe it is to move to the next stage. This is why we’re not committing to fixed dates. We’ll keep Yukoners informed at every step of the way. The six criteria we’re basing our decisions on are: community engagement, preventative measures, public health capacity, importation risk, health system capacity, and virus spread and containment. The Government of Yukon will make decisions in consultation with Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. The phases of the plan are: Phase 1 – restart; Phase 2 – recover; and Phase 3 – new normal. We also have Phase 0: response, which is the phase we were in until May 15 and, to be prepared in case the situation in Yukon backtracks and we need to impose restrictions again, we also have a Phase minus 1 – worsened state. The full plan is published on Yukon.ca. Victim Services We recognize that staying home during the pandemic is not safe for everyone. Support is available for anyone who’s not safe at home because of partner violence, family violence or sexualized violence. Victim Services can work with people to explore options based on their circumstances, help them make a safety plan and access safe shelter if they need it. To contact Victim Services, call toll free 1-800-661-0408, extension 8500. Staff at the Women’s Transition home in Whitehorse, the Dawson Women’s Shelter or Help and Hope for families in Watson Lake can also help. If anyone needs immediate help they should call 9-1-1.

552,2020-05-15,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/plan-ease-covid-19-restrictions-released-start-phase-i,Government Website,Plan to ease COVID-19 restrictions released with start of Phase I,"           Published 15/05/2020        The Government of Yukon and the Chief Medical Officer of Health have released A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions. A Path Forward presents a gradual and phased approach to lifting COVID-19 restrictions, with a focus on protecting communities and vulnerable residents, and on preventing the re-introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Yukon. The plan lays out the principles that will guide decisions on easing restrictions. They are based on public health advice and best practices across Canada adapted to fit Yukon’s local context. Phase I: Restart of A Path Forward begins today, following the easing of certain restrictions already announced during the previous “response phase” of the plan. The easing of restrictions is spread out over a number of phases. Moving to subsequent phases depends on meeting a set of clear criteria and conditions, including community engagement; keeping the ”6 steps to staying safe” preventative measures in place; controlling importation risk through border restrictions; maintaining health system and public health capacity; and continuing close monitoring of the current spread of the virus in and outside Yukon. Decisions around the timing for moving between phases in the plan will depend on risk assessment and the ongoing evaluation of success in maintaining stability and security at each phase. Continued border controls are a key part of the plan. With no active cases in the territory, importation of COVID-19 remains Yukon’s greatest risk. By mitigating that risk and helping to ensure that COVID-19 does not enter the territory, it will be easier to relax restrictions for residents inside the territory. The Government of Yukon will continue to meet with First Nations governments and municipal governments to discuss the public health details and collaborate on the other aspects of the plan and ongoing response to COVID-19. Regular updates will continue to be posted on Yukon.ca. Information is also available by calling the COVID-19 InfoLine at 877-374-0425 (7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m, seven days a week) or emailing covid19info@gov.yk.ca.            As we look to ease restrictions in Yukon, it is paramount that we do so in a way that keeps our communities safe and healthy. A Path Forward outlines our plan to get Yukoners moving again as quickly and safely as possible while protecting our communities and our most vulnerable residents. We will continue to support Yukon families and businesses through each phase of this plan as we work towards revitalizing our territory.      Premier Sandy Silver             We are in a much better place than so many of our fellow Canadians and the fact that we are able to move towards reopening is because of our successes. We were able to close our borders, self-isolate returning Yukoners and our citizens have embraced the safe six. We need to continue to do this so we can stay safe from the pandemic.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       With no new cases since April 20, Yukon remains one of the least restricted parts of the country. A Path Forward is a gradual and phased approach to easing current restrictions in the territory.  All employers are now required to complete a COVID-19 Operational Plan to identify hazards and mitigate risks for staff and the public.  Any organization wishing to have the plans of their event or activity reviewed by public health professionals can submit the details using an online form.  Restaurants will continue to be restricted to take-out only pending additional public health assessment and the development of an approved COVID-19 Operational Plan by restaurant operators.  Territorial campgrounds are on track to open on June 4 but remain closed at this time.  There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Yukon since April 20, 2020. In total, Yukon has seen 11 cases of COVID-19, all of which have recovered.  If restrictions had not been put in place, Yukon could have experienced upwards of 2,500 cases of COVID-19 according to modelling developed by the Health Emergency Operations Centre.  Until there is a vaccine or effective and accessible treatments identified, measures will need to remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.  The ”6 steps to staying safe” are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

The full name of the school and community centre will be Le Centre scolaire secondaire communautaire Paul-Émile Mercier in French or The Paul-Émile Mercier Secondary School Community Centre in English; CSSC Mercier for short. The name was proposed by Vincent Bélanger as part of a competition launched by the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon (CSFY) with the Yukon Francophone community and students from École Émilie-Tremblay and Académie Parhélie. The name was selected as part of the competition and Vincent will receive an award of $100.00 for submitting the name Paul-Émile Mercier.             I am honoured to join the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon in announcing the name for the new French First Language Secondary School. Paul-Émile Mercier’s legacy as an engineer and professor will inspire generations of Yukon students on their learning journey. Congratulations to Vincent Bélanger for making a great suggestion.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            The CSFY and the Yukon francophone community are proud to be able to associate the name of Paul-Émile Mercier with the new secondary school community centre. This is a wonderful way to pay tribute to this Francophone who left his mark on the Yukon and who contributed to the creation of our cultural heritage. Through his contribution to the economic and social vitality of the territory, Paul-Émile Mercier is a model of involvement for our community. In addition, his career as a university professor reflects his interest in sharing knowledge, which makes him an inspiring choice for a school and for the education of our students.      President of the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon Jean-Sébastien Blais            Our family is sincerely honoured that the new secondary school community centre in Whitehorse is named after our ancestor Paul-Émile Mercier. Marie-Louise Taché and Paul-Émile Mercier were married in Yukon and we are extremely proud of these roots. We offer our warmest greetings to the entire Yukon Francophone community and look forward to soon revisiting your beautiful part of the country.      The Honourable Thomas Mulcair, great-grandson of Mr. Mercier            Quick facts       The CSFY has taken the necessary steps to obtain the right to use the name in collaboration with the Government of Yukon and the descendants of Mr. Paul-Émile Mercier.          Backgrounder   About Paul-Émile Mercier Paul-Émile Mercier was born in 1877. Son of Virginie Saint-Denis and Honoré Mercier, former Premier of Quebec, Paul-Émile left his mark in Yukon as an engineer. He helped develop Yukon's transportation system in the early 20th century.  In 1901, he married Marie-Louise Taché in Whitehorse. In 1903, Mercier became director of the Department of Public Works in Whitehorse. His work led him to move around the territory. Among other things, he directed work at the Five Finger Rapids to make them less dangerous for navigators.  Returning east with his wife, he held a position as chief engineer for the city of Montréal from 1914 to 1919. Mercier's name is associated with several important functions: major in the army, land surveyor, professor at the École Polytechnique de Montréal, not to mention his participation as a member of numerous societies and associations. Paul-Émile Mercier died on August 24, 1926, at the age of 49. Paul-Émile Mercier is the great-grandfather of the Honourable Thomas Mulcair, who served as the leader of the New Democratic Party in Canada from 2012 to 2017. Construction project of the CSSC Mercier In April 2019, Ketza Construction began construction on the Riverdale Education Reserve. The new school, which will accommodate up to 150 students, will offer programming for French First Language students in Grades 7 to 12. It will provide a rich and stimulating environment that will inspire students to develop their full potential for years to come.  The initial deadline for completion was summer 2020, followed by a final phase to fit-up and commission the building. Due to COVID-19, the date of entry of students is still to be determined and will be shared once available. Funding for the project includes $7.5 million from the Government of Canada and its Official Languages Support Program. These funds finance community spaces, which will be shared with the community and other students on the campus. It includes spaces for a multi-purpose room, a community radio station, a community kitchen and an atrium to host a variety of activities and events. The CSFY provides monthly updates on the progress of construction on its website and on social networks. The Government of Yukon also updates an online page to keep the community informed.

This year’s priorities focus on collaboration to: increase public trust and foster meaningful relationships; strengthen support for vulnerable persons and victims of crime; support enforcement efforts to combat serious drug-related and violent crime; and allow for innovation that supports access to restorative justice processes. These policing priorities reflect recommendations made by the Yukon Police Council and priorities of the Department of Justice. The Yukon Police Council receives valuable input from Yukon agencies, organizations and citizens on what they would like to see in the policing priorities.            I would like to thank all Yukoners who provided the Yukon Police Council with their input on policing priorities for 2020–21. This year’s policing priorities are responsive to the needs of Yukoners and work towards reducing violence, supporting victims and building stronger and safer communities. Our government is grateful to the RCMP for their ongoing dedication to enforcing the law and serving our territory.

CEMA enforcement officers are now in place in Carmacks, Mayo, Dawson, Ross River, Faro, Haines Junction, Old Crow, Teslin and Watson Lake.  RCMP remain available to support enforcement in all communities, and may issue fines or make arrests of those found violating the CEMA orders. The Government of Yukon is ensuring that adequate enforcement measures and capacity are in place in all Yukon communities to help protect Yukon from the risks of importing COVID-19.            We know that Yukoners are concerned about the possibility of importing COVID-19 to the territory. Strong measures at our borders reduce the risk within the Yukon.  Our efforts to provide information and education about the CEMA Orders have been very successful in achieving compliance and understanding, ensuring that both Yukoners and people entering the territory follow the guidance that COVID-19 has made necessary. We will continue to work with our community partners to keep our territory safe and healthy.       Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       A new information station will be set up at the Alaska Highway junction with Robert Service Way south of Whitehorse. This station will help ensure that non-resident travellers stay on their designated route and do not travel into Whitehorse.  Orders that are enforceable under CEMA include: Entry to Yukon is restricted to Yukon residents, family of Yukon residents, critical and essential workers, people transiting through the territory within 24 hours, and people exercising Aboriginal or treaty rights. Gatherings are limited to 10 people or less People must self-isolate for 14 days when they enter Yukon Bars and restaurants must close or be open for takeout only  RCMP are empowered to make arrests under CEMA as of May 13.  They are also tasked with enforcing the federal government’s Quarantine Act.  The information station in Whitehorse is only for those non-Yukon-resident travellers en-route through the territory to Alaska or other destinations, and will not attempt stop local traffic.  Yukon’s enforcement of CEMA orders is a complaint-based process.

The meeting focused on how the governments can work together to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders discussed health and social supports, the economy, education, treaty rights, and Yukon’s comprehensive reopening strategy, which will be unveiled tomorrow.            Close communication between governments is absolutely critical as we navigate Yukon through this pandemic. The respectful relationships we have built with our First Nations partners through the Yukon Forum have put us in a very strong position to respond collaboratively to keep Yukoners safe. This was a timely meeting to discuss how we will work together to prevent the spread of this virus, support citizens and plan for economic recovery.      Premier Sandy Silver            Keeping our communities and citizens safe is the top concern among Yukon First Nations leaders.

The changes will also support effective and efficient health care during this time. Under these temporary changes, pharmacists will have new options for extending prescriptions and also a limited ability to initiate prescriptions. The temporary changes support Health Canada’s March 2020 exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to maintain Yukoners’ access to controlled substances for medical treatments. Minor changes to pharmacists’ licensing requirements ensure pharmacists are supported in their work and Yukoners have better access to pharmacy services. During the pandemic, the Government of Yukon believes that relying on pharmacists’ expertise and discretion will better serve Yukoners. These temporary changes are effective immediately.                  Quick facts       Yukon’s Pharmacists Regulation came into effect in 2019. The regulations, standards of practice, the Health Professions Act as well as federal regulations such as the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, dictate how pharmacists in the territory practice.  Canada issued a temporary exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in March 2020. This exemption was made in the public interest to support access to certain medications during the pandemic. Yukon is amending its regulations and standards of practice, in part, to facilitate this exemption in Yukon.  See backgrounder for a list of the key temporary changes.          Backgrounder   The Government of Yukon has introduced temporary changes to how pharmacists can practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include changes to both pharmacists’ standards of practice and the Pharmacists Regulation. These short-term changes will ensure Yukoners can continue to safely access needed prescriptions. These new rules include: changes to how pharmacists can extend and initiate prescriptions; changes to support Health Canada’s temporary exemption to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; and changes to some licensing requirements. Pharmacists will use their professional discretion in deciding when to use the new practice options available to them. In making their decisions they will be guided by the need to ensure both public and patient safety.Changes to how pharmacists can extend and initiate prescriptions Pharmacists are now permitted to use their discretion to: extend prescriptions following phone or video consult if in-person is not advisable; initiate prescriptions for certain medical conditions; and extend prescriptions up to 30 days more than once. Changes to support exemptions under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act Pharmacists are now permitted to use their discretion to: transfer prescriptions for controlled substances to other pharmacies; arrange for delivery of controlled substances under certain circumstances; accept verbal orders from physicians for controlled substances; and extend prescriptions for controlled substances. Changes to licensing requirements The Government of Yukon has made temporary changes to a few licensing requirements to ensure pharmacists can continue to practice in Yukon despite the fact that some exams and services have been cancelled. These changes include changes to what documentation we require as well as changes to requirements for pharmacist provisional or intern licences. Provisional licences are conditional licences in which licensees practice under supervision. These will now be temporarily available to new graduates who have not completed their qualifying examinations due to COVID-19 cancellations. Timeline Changes related to Health Canada’s exemptions will remain in effect until Health Canada advises, or until September 30, 2020. Other changes will be in place until 30-days after Yukon’s state of emergency is lifted or as otherwise directed by the Registrar.

Last week, Community Services extended the deadlines for AGMs as an interim measure. A Ministerial Order under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) issued today provides additional flexibility for groups wishing to hold annual general meetings (AGMs) right away. Depending upon organizations’ articles, bylaws and partnership agreements, the current COVID19 ban on gatherings of more than 10 people can impede businesses, societies and other organizations from holding AGMs as required by the current legislation governing them. This order broadens the options for organizations to hold AGMs, regardless of specific provisions in their bylaws or partnership agreements. This order is effective retroactively to March 17, 2020. It continues for 90 days past the end of the COVID-19 state of emergency for organizations governed by the Societies Act and Cooperative Associations Act. The order extends for 30 days after the end of the emergency for organizations governed by the Partnership and Business Names Act and the Business Corporations Act.             We continue to respond to the needs of Yukoners. The need for in-person meetings can be a significant barrier to businesses and societies during the COVID19 pandemic. They can now hold their regulated meetings, including annual general meetings, electronically or by teleconference. For instance, societies will be able to hold their mandatory annual general meetings and submit their approved year-end reports and financial statements to remain in compliance with the Societies Act and receive funding. We made the order retroactive to support any society or business, which has already held their AGM online in good faith.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker             Quick facts       Organizations and corporations can plan ahead to review and consider updating their bylaws to allow for the usage of technology during meetings, even after the expiration date of the interim order.  If organizations and corporations decide not to make these updates, they must follow the existing provisions set out by their respective statutes, regulations, articles, bylaws and partnership agreements.  The Minister of Community Services has issued a Ministerial Order (2020/24) under the Civil Emergency Measures Act. It empowers Deputy Ministers to adjust certain timelines for organizations affected by COVID-19 restrictions and orders. Under the authority of this Ministerial Order, the Deputy Minister of Community Services directed that, effective March 17, 2020, deadlines under the Cooperative Associations Act, Societies Act are extended for 90 days until after the end of the COVID-19 state of emergency. The deadline is extended for 30 days for the Partnership and Business Names Act and Business Corporations Act.

The report, Putting People First, presents a bold approach that would position Yukon as a national leader in the health and social care delivery. It would move Yukon toward a more holistic and person centred system. While there is still extensive analysis that must be done, I believe this is the right direction for our territory and I am very pleased to see such a progressive, modern approach to revitalizing health services in Yukon. This plan offers a holistic approach to providing health and social services. It aligns with our goal of ensuring that the individual receiving care is at the heart of the system and that all services are geared to support the individual in all aspects of their life. I would like to thank the independent expert panel for their diligent work completing this report. This panel was appointed in 2018 to review all programs and services delivered by the Department of Health and Social Services and the Yukon Hospital Corporation as well as those funded by the Department and delivered by non-governmental organizations. The panel was asked to look at how services are organized, managed and delivered. It was also asked to look for ways to better serve Yukoners. The panel undertook extensive engagement with Yukoners and service providers throughout the territory. I appreciate all those who provided input throughout this process. Health care services affect everyone and it is important to our government that Yukon voices are reflected in this report. I look forward to thoroughly reviewing the plan and working with Department of Health and Social Services staff to determine the feasibility of the suggested changes. Thank you again to all Yukoners who contributed to this report. It would not have been possible to fully review health and social programs and services without your input. Thank you again to the panel for your hard work, I appreciate your contribution to our territory’s healthy future.

The aim of the report, which is based on detailed data from a range of sources, is to provide direction that will help to reduce motor vehicle collision injuries in Yukon. The report includes seven key recommendations.            Motor vehicle collisions are one of the leading causes of avoidable death and injury in Yukon. It is my hope that this report will be the start of an important conversation about reducing the motor vehicle collision injuries in our territory.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       In 2016, Yukon ranked the second highest for motor vehicle injury and fatality rates per capita in the country.  Between 2011 and 2015, the RCMP reported 3,789 motor vehicle collisions in Yukon, of which 746 (19.7 per cent) were reported to have resulted in an injury.  Yukon has some of the highest reported alcohol and drug impaired driving rates in Canada.  Inattentive/distracted driving was the most commonly reported contributing factor to motor vehicle collisions in Yukon between 2011 and 2017, and also resulted in some of the most severe injuries.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, May 12, at 2 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,106 individuals have been tested. We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread has occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Weekday case updates While the number of cases of COVID-19 remains low, we’ll update information about COVID-19 cases and tests every weekday on Yukon.ca rather than daily as we have been doing lately. The information we publish includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Keeping COVID-19 out of Yukon With no new cases announced since April 20, we must work together to keep COVID-19 out of the territory. We can do this by continuing to control our borders and maintaining the requirement for people arriving in Yukon to self-isolate for 14 days. Keeping these measures in place will enable us to start easing other restrictions. Under the current Border Control Measures Order, people can only enter Yukon if they can provide evidence that they are: Yukon residents; non-resident family members of Yukon residents; delivering a critical or essential service; travelling through Yukon to a neighbouring jurisdiction, which they must do with 24 hours; or exercising an Aboriginal or treaty right. Information about how to safely self-isolate is on Yukon.ca. National Nursing Week During National Nursing Week, May 11 to 17, we’re celebrating the vital contributions that nurses make to our lives and are grateful for all they’re doing to help keep our families and friends safe and well in Yukon and all across the country. This year’s particularly apt theme is Nurses: A Voice to Lead – Nursing the World to Health. The World Health Organization has designated 2020 the Year of the Nurse. Six steps to staying safe The six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; avoiding unnecessary travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

Tenants living in private non-subsidized market rental housing in Yukon who have lost 30 per cent or more of their income due to COVID-19 are eligible for a grant to help cover rent from April to June 2020. Eligible households can receive 50% of median market rent based on unit size using the Whitehorse median market rent: $415 per month for a bachelor, or room in a house; $500 per month for a 1 bedroom; $600 per month for a 2 bedroom; and $800 per month for a 3 bedroom or larger. The grant will be paid directly to landlords on behalf of tenants. This will ensure that landlords, who may also be experiencing lower income as a result of the pandemic, continue receiving partial income from their rental properties, and tenants who have had to defer paying rent will have less owing. In March, the Government of Yukon passed new regulations to prevent evictions for 90 days for residential tenants impacted by COVID-19, and allowed tenants to defer rent payments. The COVID-19 Rent Assist program application process will be available online at Yukon.ca shortly. Individuals interested in the program can contact the Yukon Housing Corporation at ykhouse@gov.yk.ca, or by calling 867-667-5759 in Whitehorse, or toll-free at 1-800-661-0408, extension 5759.            Many Yukon tenants and landlords are facing financial challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.   The COVID-19 Rent Assist Program will help mitigate the financial impacts on those whose situation may compromise their ability to pay their mortgage or rent during this public emergency. The Government of Yukon will continue to support Yukoners during these uncertain times as we work to keep our territory safe and healthy.      Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost            Quick facts       To be eligible for the program tenants must have lost 30 per cent of more of their income due to COVID-19.

Yukoners are reminded to act responsible and remember that Recycling is a powerful attractant for bears. If you are storing it while the depots are closed, wash it thoroughly and keep it in a secure and enclosed space, ideally a garage. Bears that are attracted and rewarded with human-sourced food often become a threat to public safety. They no longer fear people, houses or vehicles and may become more aggressive in their search for food. Farmers and hobbyists with livestock should use electric fencing. It’s a safe and effective way to keep bears and other predators off your property. It can be used to prevent access to livestock pens, chicken coops, beehives, dog kennels, vegetable gardens, fruit trees, berry bushes, compost and garbage. Bears can show up at any time in Yukon. Be alert, travel in groups while adhering to physical distancing recommendations, keep children nearby, make noise and carry bear spray. Keep bear spray accessible and know how to use it. Yukoners can learn more about safety, awareness and bear ecology at the virtual bear fair event on the Conservation Officer Services Branch Facebook page @yukoncoservices, from May 11 to 15.            We share our wilderness home with a large and active bear population. As the weather draws more people outside to enjoy the land, it is a good time to remind all Yukoners of our role in reducing the potential for human-wildlife conflict. Let’s do our part to ensure the safety of the public and to keep our bears wild and alive by properly managing attractants.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            A coop full of chickens is an easy target for a hungry bear. WildWise Yukon is dedicated to reducing human conflict with wildlife. This summer we are helping food producers install electric fencing around these major attractants. Properly installed electric fencing is the best available tool for keeping livestock safe from bears and bears away from livestock.      Executive Director of WildWise Yukon Heather Ashthorn            Quick facts       The second annual Bear Fair has gone virtual in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Managing attractants, at home or while camping, is one of the most important things we can do to manage human-wildlife conflict. Keep attractants in secure waste containers, vehicles, hard-sided trailers, bear-proof canisters, locked buildings or behind electric fencing.

566,2020-05-08,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/may-8-2020-covid-19-update,Government Website,"May 8, 2020: COVID-19 update","           Published 08/05/2020        Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, May 8, at 2 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,075 individuals have been tested. We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread has occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Daily updates The Government of Yukon publishes information about COVID-19 tests daily on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Guidelines for health care professionals We are providing guidelines to help health care practitioners who aren’t doctors and nurses to reopen their businesses in ways that will keep their clients safe. These practitioners are called allied health professionals and they include: acupuncturists; chiropractors; naturopaths; occupational therapists; osteopaths; physiotherapists; and registered massage therapists. Under the new guidelines, practitioners will call patients 24 hours before their appointment to screen them for COVID-19 and should maintain physical distancing when they meet patients in person. Guidelines for optometrists We are also providing guidelines for optometrists to help them provide services safely to Yukoners during the pandemic. Health care workers We do not require health care workers to self-isolate and avoid social gatherings when they’re not at work. However, we do ask them to comply with all current recommendations and orders, including holding any social gatherings outdoors and in a well-spaced grouping of not more than 10 people.  Supporting fundraisers We encourage Yukoners to find new ways to support charities or take part in fundraising activities during the pandemic. This is as long as people have the money or time to participate and activities are carried out safely. Run for Mom, for example, which takes place on Mother’s Day, Sunday, May 10, is inviting Yukoners to run, walk or cycle any route they choose while practising safe spacing rather than take part in the usual annual run around the 4.2 kilometre Millennium Trail in Whitehorse. Run for Mom is an annual event to raise awareness of breast health and money for breast imaging equipment at Whitehorse General Hospital. Six steps to staying safe The six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; avoiding unnecessary travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

567,2020-05-08,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/drug-use-reminder-issued-times-pandemic,Government Website,Drug use reminder issued in times of pandemic,"           Published 08/05/2020        The Yukon's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley, and Yukon's Chief Coroner Heather Jones are cautioning Yukon residents around drug use after seven drug-related deaths since January 2020: three deaths in March and April are confirmed as fentanyl-related, while three deaths from January and February are still awaiting toxicology confirmation of drug content. The COVID-19 pandemic compounds the ongoing public health crisis related to high rates of illicit drug overdose and deaths, as well as acute harms from substance use. There are concerns that the street supply is becoming even more unpredictable as regular supply channels are disrupted, and supports for people who use drugs are difficult to access.            Each of these recent deaths mean another life extinguished too soon and another family left to grieve. These tragedies are a brutal reminder that fentanyl and other dangerous drugs remain within easy reach. We have no way of knowing if these deaths would have happened even without COVID 19 but it does offer us the opportunity to remind individuals to not use alone and to have a naloxone kit handy. It’s also an opportunity to remind Yukoners of the excellent Opioid Treatment Services available at the Referred Care Clinic. Anyone can access the OTS clinic, no referral is needed. Any drug death is a loss and at this time, when families cannot gather, it is doubly sad.      Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley            Yukon Coroner’s Service has seen a significant increase in accidental illicit drug-related deaths over the past few months. The numbers have more than doubled from those seen in the same 2019 period. This is cause for real concern, which is shared by the Chief Medical Officer of Health.  We join him in reminding Yukoners to access the many resources available. Every death of a Yukoner has impact and together we can work to prevent unnecessary heartbreak and pain in our communities.      Yukon’s Chief Coroner Heather Jones            Ongoing enforcement efforts by the Yukon RCMP's Crime Reduction Unit continues to indicate that a variety of 'hard' drugs, including fentanyl, are making their way into the illicit supply chain. The RCMP is fully supportive of Yukon Health's harm reduction program and remains committed to working with Health Authorities and NGO's in the timely sharing of information impacting those most vulnerable to the illicit drug trade.      Chief Superintendent Scott Sheppard, Commanding Officer of the Yukon RCMP            Quick facts       Blood Ties, located at 405 Ogilvie Street, offers harm reduction services including fentanyl testing in Whitehorse, Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. While fentanyl testing can only happen at the Ogilvie location, outreach services can deliver harm reduction supplies to clients’ homes.  Opioid Treatment Services at the Referred Care Clinic, located at 210 Elliot Street, does not require a referral; anyone can access these services which include strong social supports. The Opioid Overdose Prevention Coordinator also works out of the RCC.  Don’t use drugs alone, and make sure you have a naloxone kit on hand. Kits are available at locations across Yukon: http://www.hss.gov.yk.ca/fentanyl.php. The Opioid Overdose Prevention Coordinator is still available for training: 867-332-0722   You can still social distance while doing drugs.

The Department of Highways and Public Works received the project evaluation report from YESAB on May 1, 2020. YESAB is also requesting effects monitoring once the project is complete including speed monitoring; usage analysis by vehicles and vulnerable road users; an audit of the department’s comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach to collision prevention; and a report detailing changes in the new Motor Vehicles Act aimed at improving safety for vulnerable road users. The Department of Highways and Public Works is committing to undertaking the requested effects monitoring, which will contribute to ongoing work to better understand who, how, and when our roads are used. This data will inform future project designs for all Yukoners.            The Alaska Highway is a critical route for all Yukoners and we are pleased to be making upgrades that will slow traffic and increase safety for all users in the Whitehorse area. YESAB’s evaluation report is a testament to the strong work of our design team and we look forward to sharing the monitoring results with Yukoners.       Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       Safety improvements on the Alaska Highway include two new signalized intersections between Lodestar Lane and Range Road, which will reduce speeds and give vulnerable road users a safe opportunity to cross.  New paved multi-use trails will connect to the city’s growing trail network and the closure of unsafe accesses will reduce the risk of collisions.   Construction on Phase 1 will start this summer.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, May 5, at 2 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,041 individuals have been tested. We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory.

This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Yukon modelling Modelling shows that because Yukoners have followed the six steps to staying safe, we have successfully reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the territory. If we had not put restrictions in place when we did, our modelling shows we would have expected to have seen around 2,500 cases of COVID-19 by May 1. Instead we saw 11. We would also have expected approximately 150 people to be in a hospital by May 1. No one in Yukon infected by COVID-19 has had to go to a hospital and, on average, there are 28 unoccupied hospital beds every day. If we’d had 10 cases and no restrictions, we could have seen more than 7,000 cases, with close to 1,000 hospitalizations. We will provide a technical briefing about modelling in Yukon soon. Pandemic impact on Yukoners It’s vital that Yukoners continue to practise the six steps to staying safe. As a territory, we must take a long-term view of the pandemic and move gradually and in an evidence-based way that’s specific to Yukon circumstances towards easing restrictions so we can ensure we’re always prepared for any changes in our situation. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting everybody in different ways, depending on our circumstances and vulnerabilities. We cannot always anticipate how each of us will be affected. Yukoners can play a role in supporting others through this difficult experience as well as making sure we seek help for ourselves when we need it. We must also balance our personal responses to the pandemic with the risks to other Yukoners’ health. Each safe action we take helps others who are vulnerable. Spartan Cube machines On April 17, 2020, we said we expected to receive the Spartan Cube machines we had ordered from the federal government around the end of May for portable, rapid testing around the territory. However, because of problems with the Spartan Cube’s performance, Health Canada will no longer be supplying the machines. Six steps to staying safe The six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; avoiding travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

570,2020-05-04,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/new-support-available-yukons-aviation-industry,Government Website,New support available for Yukon’s aviation industry,"           Published 04/05/2020        Yukon’s aviation sector will receive $3.56 million in support to help compensate for lost revenues as a result of COVID-19.  The government will flow federal funding to aviation businesses to support critical and essential routes and the transportation of vital supplies. The $3.56 million in funding is Yukon’s portion of Government of Canada support announced on April 14. Of this funding, $1.1 million will be directed to Air North over three months to ensure the continued operation of critical routes to the North. These routes ensure scheduled delivery of medical samples, supplies and critical front line staff to Yukon.   Yukon aviation businesses will benefit from the waiving of commercial fees. When coupled with the previously announced waiver of aviation landing, parking and loading fees, these changes will save aviation businesses approximately $780,000. The new fee waivers include: * land lease and licence fees; 	* building lease and licence fees; 	* air terminal building concession fees; 	* aircraft fuel lease and licence fees; 	* aircraft fuel concession fees; 	* parking stall fees; and 	* service recoveries like charges for electricity. These fees are waived from April 1 until December 31, 2020.             Yukon’s airlines are critical to our northern lifestyle. They connect our communities, safely get us to medical services, transport much needed goods and support our economy. This funding will ensure critical medical cargo, including COVID-19 tests, continues to be sent to and from the territory. Airlines have been deeply impacted by this pandemic and we are glad to provide some support at this time.       Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            All Yukon businesses have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. With our year over year traffic down by 96% in April, we have had to reduce capacity drastically, while still maintaining a minimum level of essential service to the communities we serve. We have also had to slash our overhead costs in order to stem losses. We are very thankful for the help provided by both the Yukon Government and the Federal Government under the Commercial Fee Waiver Program, the Yukon Business Relief Program, the Northern Essential Air Services Relief Program, and the 75% Wage Subsidy Program. Together these programs will help see us through to better times.       Air North, Yukon’s Airline President Joseph Sparling            Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking at very low traffic this year which will have a dramatic impact on Yukon’s aviation industry. Our association represents aviation companies across the north and we are seeing firsthand the impact this pandemic is having on northern and remote aviation operators.  This government support will help businesses through this crisis so that we can continue to provide valuable transportation services in the future.       Northern Air Transportation Industry President Wendy Tayler            Quick facts       The aviation industry has been among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 public health crisis with passenger traffic dropping almost 90 per cent nationally.   Air North will be the primary beneficiary of this funding. This funding will support five weekly flights to Vancouver and three on their northern route that services Dawson and Old Crow.           Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136matthew.cameron@gov.yk.ca  Brittany Cross 	Communications, Highways and Public Works 	867-332-4601brittany.cross@gov.yk.ca      News release #:   20-122    Related information:   Support for aviation industry         "

The John Howard Society is now providing clients with continuous support and advocacy as they navigate potential obstacles in their reintegration, and assist them to establish positive community connections. The new program provides 24/7 community supervised services and supports for justice-involved clients who are on conditional sentences, mandatory supervision and temporary absences and do not require high security custodial care, including individuals who were previously receiving services at the Yukon Adult Resource Centre. The new program is operating in a distinct and independent facility at the Whitehorse Correctional Centre (WCC) building to maximize services and better support justice-involved clients. The facility has a total of 40 beds and its location will allow for more effective program delivery at the supervised residential facility and the Whitehorse Correctional Centre. Individuals will continue to access the programming through an application process that results from a referral from the courts, corrections or the Justice Wellness Centre. The provision of services by the John Howard Society represents an important step towards ensuring the well-being and successful community reintegration of justice-involved clients. The Government of Yukon is looking forward to working with the John Howard Society, and thanks the Salvation Army for their many years of service.            The Government of Yukon knows that providing services and support to justice-involved clients while they make the transition back into our communities is critical to their rehabilitation. We are pleased to welcome the John Howard Society to Yukon, and look forward to our ongoing work together.      Minister of Justice Tracy-Anne McPhee            We are honoured to be delivering the new Supervised Residential Housing program, and for the opportunity to work closely with the Government of Yukon and other community partners and stakeholders to support the safety of the Whitehorse community and deliver services which meet the needs of individuals transitioning in the territory. We look forward to working as part of the local community and bringing our extensive experience with reintegration services, community-based residential facilities, innovative and person-centered program design and delivery, outreach, and community services to this exciting new program.

This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. A personal message for Yukoners from the Chief Medical Officer of Health I recognize that people are getting tired of the restrictions that have been put in place. They see Yukon’s low number of cases of infection and wonder why we are keeping things locked down so tightly. They look to our neighbours to the south and the east and see that other parts of Canada are beginning to open up. Here in Yukon, while people feel we have taken drastic measures, we haven’t had to go as far as many of the provinces had to. When our neighbours to the south and east open up, their first phases will be catching up to where we are now in terms of restrictions. We want to take a calm and measured approach to reopening the territory. More details will be coming week by week. We want to take incremental steps and, if it’s fine and we don’t see more disease, then walk in a little deeper. The worst thing would be that if we open up, see a resurgence of the disease within the territory and have to shut down again, just after folks have tasted a little bit of freedom. Increasing non-urgent hospital services Yukon’s hospitals will on a limited basis increase some elective and non-urgent services that were temporarily suspended over the last month to help limit the spread of COVID-19. The services include elective surgeries and non-urgent bloodwork, x-rays, imaging tests, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and appointments with visiting specialists. Hospitals will provide all of these resumed services by appointment only so they can maintain physical distancing and ensure the safety of vulnerable populations and health care workers. The hospitals will contact people to let them know when their appointment is. They will continue screening all patients and visitors for risk of infection at all hospital entrances. Accessing mental health services Looking after our mental health is part of how we should respond to the pandemic whatever our situation or role, including people who have never accessed mental health services before. Feeling afraid, worried or stressed are normal in a crisis and with all the change that COVID-19 has brought to our lives, so is feeling we’re no longer in control and grieving for what we have lost. Reaching out for extra mental health support is a sign of strength. There are plenty of mental health professionals available to help and Yukoners are reminded they can call Mental Wellness and Substance Use Services at 867-456-3838 or toll free at 1-866-456-3838. People can also call the Canadian Mental Health Association for phone counselling appointments at 867-668-6429. The Child Development Centre at 867-456-8182 provides services for families with children under school age. Families with children or adults with disabilities can call Disability Services at 867-393-7464. We provide anyone coming into the territory with a list of resources and tools for self-care and mental wellness while they self-isolate. People can find free resources for supporting mental health at the Wellness Together Canada at ca.portal.gs.

The orders: Suspend limitation periods, under Yukon law, for civil and family actions that would have expired during the state of emergency or within the 30 days after the state of emergency ends. The limitation periods will now expire 90 days after the state of emergency ends. The same extension will apply to the initiation of prosecutions under Yukon law. Allow judges and other statutory decision-makers, operating under Yukon law, to waive, suspend or extend the time periods as they deem necessary; for up to 90 days after the state of emergency. Provide a 30-day extension on affidavits or statutory declarations required under Yukon law, where an affidavit or statutory declaration would have normally been due during or up to 10 days after the state of emergency ends. Deputy ministers will have authority to specify circumstances where the extension to affidavits or statutory declarations will not apply. Provide authority for deputy ministers to alter the terms of Government of Yukon contracts in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Provide deputy ministers with the authority to extend leases, licences, certificates, permits and other approvals issued under Yukon law for up to 90 days after the state of emergency ends. Enable deputy ministers to extend legislative timelines set out in Yukon laws for up to 90 days after the state of emergency ends. These orders are intended to reduce the burden on organizations, businesses, governments and individuals facing challenges meeting legislative timelines and contractual obligations as a result of COVID-19 related factors.            We recognize that individuals, businesses, governments and others may not be able to meet certain legislated timelines and contractual obligations in light of the current emergency for a variety of reasons such as illness, the requirement to self-isolate, employment or financial situations.

The First Ministers state that until there is a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19, strong measures must be in place for this new normal phase of living with COVID-19 to contain future waves or outbreaks and protect Canadians and economies across the country. A key objective shared by all First Ministers is to minimize the risk of another wave of COVID-19 that would lead governments to re-impose severe restrictions. The principles agreed to by the First Ministers to guide this process include: science and evidence-based decision making; continued coordination and collaboration across the country; accountability and transparency; and flexibility and proportionality. The criteria and measures agreed to by the First Ministers in order to restart the economy include: that COVID-19 transmission is controlled; sufficient public health capacity is in place to test, trace, and isolate all cases; expanded health care capacity exists for all patients; supports are in place for vulnerable groups/communities and key populations; workplace preventative measures are in place; measures are taken to avoid risk of importation; and governments will continue to engage and support.

The Ministerial Order specifies affected drivers will not be penalized or face licence suspensions if they cannot provide their medical examination certificate during the state of emergency. Commercial drivers can continue to provide their vital service to Yukon communities and drivers aged 70 years and older will not have restrictions placed on their mobility. The exemption period started on March 18 and will end 90 days after the end of the state of emergency declared by the government.             As we work to limit society’s exposure to COVID-19, we are uncovering real problems people face coping with this emergency. Commercial drivers need to provide their essential service and older Yukoners need to focus on their health as much as possible. This order accomplishes that.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       In mid-March, the Yukon Medical Association notified government that non-essential, in-person care would be postponed until further notice. Medical examinations for all classes of Yukon drivers were also postponed until after the COVID-19 public health crisis.  Affected drivers are still required to file their medical examination report with the Motor Vehicles office, but they will have until the end of the exemption period to provide it.  Any drivers who haven’t submitted their medical examination certificate by the end of the exemption period risk having their licences suspended or cancelled.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 28, at 2 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. Eight of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and all others are doing well at home. We can trace each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread to have occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Daily updates The Government of Yukon publishes information about COVID-19 tests daily on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Testing update We shared the new testing criteria we announced on Friday, April 24, with health care professionals over the weekend. They have now increased testing for people who have a broader range of symptoms and who have travelled outside Yukon. We’ve also opened up testing to people who have not travelled. This allows us to test people from vulnerable populations including residents in long-term care homes and marginalized citizens who struggle with housing and day-to-day living. As we move towards lightening the current restrictions we’re living under, we need to have the appropriate testing capacity in place to watch for community spread and to know where infection is and track where it’s been. National Immunization Awareness Week  April 25 to May 2 is National Immunization Awareness Week. We want Yukoners to keep routine immunizations for children up to date. Delaying or missing scheduled vaccines puts children at risk for common and serious childhood infections such as measles and whooping cough. Protecting babies and children through vaccinations and reducing the risk of an outbreak of a disease that’s preventable by a vaccine is a public health priority. We have strategies in place across all Yukon health care centres to continue to deliver these services safely. Don’t put your health on hold The government launched a new campaign this week to remind Yukon residents that if they’re ill, they can still call their doctor, visit the health centre or go to the Emergency Department. Numbers of physician, health centre and emergency visits have dropped in recent weeks and we’re concerned that people who may be really ill or have legitimate health concerns are putting off that call or visit because of COVID-19. Lifting of restrictions Work continues on developing a national, coordinated approach to how and when to gradually ease restrictions put in place in response to the pandemic. Recognizing the different situations in each jurisdiction, changes will be implemented locally based on local circumstances. Planning for Yukon’s opening up strategy is underway led by the Premier’s office and following a public health framework developed by the Chief Medical Officer of Health, in coordination with federal and jurisdictional counterparts. Some Yukon businesses have begun to reopen on their own initiative after changing their practices to comply with current public health advice. Retail operations may remain open as long as they have a plan in place to serve the public safely. Other establishments, such as bars, restaurants except for take out and delivery, recreation facilities and businesses offering personal services, remain closed under public health order. All closures and operating requirements will be reviewed as part of Yukon’s opening plan.   Businesses can view the cleaning guidelines that have been approved by the government’s environmental health services on Yukon.ca. Social gatherings The ban on gatherings of more than 10 people refers to social gatherings rather than work environments. People within a workplace must space themselves appropriately and take increased hygiene precautions. The maximum number of people in a work space depends on the size of the establishment and not the absolute number. Indoor gatherings should be limited to usual household members and close family members and should not exceed 10 people. Outdoor gatherings of 10 or fewer are allowed as long as people are appropriately spaced. Six steps to staying safe The six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; avoiding travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

This is a day to remember our friends, colleagues and family members who have died or been injured in the workplace. Everyday an individual goes to work to provide for themselves and their families, they should return home alive and in good health. No one should be faced with the prospect of going to work and never coming home. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. The Day of Mourning is a time to honour those who passed too early and those seriously injured while at work. It is also a reminder of our shared responsibility to make sure that each one of us gets home safe from work every day. We all have the spirit of safety within us, and we have the wisdom and experience to empower the next generation of workers to continue fostering that culture of safety. We owe it to those we have lost to continue to change workplace culture to ensure that safety comes first.

Currently, under Yukon’s Social Assistance Regulation the CERB would qualify as unearned income and result in a reduction in the total amount of Social Assistance benefits. Forthcoming changes under the Civil Emergency Measures Act will fully exempt CERB payments from April to June 2020. Additional support is also available for Yukoners receiving Social Assistance benefits who are waiting to receive their CERB payments. Individuals in need of emergency financial support are encouraged to contact Income Support Services at 867-667-5674 or by email at incomesupport@gov.yk.ca. Income Support workers are available to ensure the needs of individuals are met throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.            It is important that Yukoners are not placed in financial hardship as we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes, which align with recommendations from the Government of Canada, will make Yukon one of just two jurisdictions in Canada to fully exempt CERB payments from Social Assistance benefits.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       The Government of Canada recommends that the provinces and territories work to ensure that Canadians who are receiving CERB payments are not penalized by seeing a reduction in overall benefits.

580,2020-04-27,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukon-receives-ventilators-federal-emergency-response-services,Government Website,Yukon receives ventilators from federal emergency response services,"           Published 27/04/2020        Yukon has received six ventilators from the Public Health Agency of Canada’s emergency response services, significantly increasing the territory’s capacity to provide acute care in response to COVID-19. Yukon now has a total of 15 ventilators distributed between the Yukon Hospital Corporation and Emergency Medical Services. Five of the new ventilators have been assigned to Whitehorse General Hospital, one intensive care unit Puritan Bennett 840 model and four of the portable Newport HT-50 models. One additional portable ventilator has been assigned to Emergency Medical Services.            We are very fortunate that there are currently no patients in our hospitals with COVID-19. With expanded ventilator capacity and a dedicated team of healthcare professionals, Yukon is well prepared in the event that we see a surge of patients in serious condition. We will continue to work with our partners at the local, regional and national levels to ensure our healthcare system has the resources necessary to manage COVID-19 in our territory.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Yukon has been able to receive critical pieces of equipment that will increase the territory’s capacity to respond to COVID-19. It is important to acknowledge that we have not just the equipment itself, but we also have a team which is trained and ready to use the ventilators if and when the time comes.      Yukon Hospital Corporation Board Chairman Brian Gillen            Quick facts       The Puritan Bennett 840 (Intensive Care Unit ventilator) and Newport HT50s (portable ventilator) arrived in Yukon on April 17.  They will be returned to Public Health Agency of Canada’s emergency response services after the pandemic.  Previously there were six ventilators at Whitehorse General Hospital, and one portable unit at each of the community hospitals in Dawson City and Watson Lake. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) also has a ventilator as part of their equipment.  Whitehorse General Hospital has 30 hospital nurses trained to operate a ventilator, with support offered by a group of seven anesthesia physicians.  EMS has 28 critical care paramedics who can intubate patients and run ventilators. Community Health Centre primary care nurses are trained in an intermediate airway which is similar to intubation but less technical.

Eight of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and all others are doing well at home. No one has had to go to a hospital. Daily updates Information about COVID-19 tests is published daily on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Changes to testing criteria From Monday, April 27, the criteria for who is tested for COVID-19 in Yukon will be expanded. People will be tested if they have any one of the following symptoms and if they have travelled outside the territory in the last 14 days or have had close contact with anyone who has travelled outside the territory. The symptoms for recent travellers include fever, chills, cough, difficulty breathing, a sore throat or hoarse voice, headache, runny nose or nasal congestion, unexplained vomiting or diarrhea, fatigue or muscle aches, or loss of smell or taste. People with no travel history but who are experiencing fever, cough, or difficulty breathing can also be tested. Testing will also be broadened in long-term care facility residents and the Whitehorse Emergency Shelter clients. The reasons for broadening the testing criteria are that due to being well past the peak of flu season we are seeing fewer people come forward for testing. We wish to continue with high rates of testing to detect any COVID as early as possible. We also are working to continue to protect vulnerable populations and to increase our ability to detect signals of community transmission. Community transmission means it is no longer possible to trace how somebody became infected. The origin of all 11 cases in Yukon so far has been traced back to travel outside the territory. Health care providers continue to have the discretion to make decisions about who is tested or not based on their clinical expertise. The self-assessment tool on Yukon.ca and the 811 Health Line will be updated with the new criteria on April 27. Doctor’s offices and community health centres  Yukoners are reminded they can call their doctor for their regular health needs such as renewing medication, dealing with chronic health conditions or to discuss new concerns. Doctor’s offices and community health centres remain open. Health support for Yukon communities  Information about health services support for communities during the pandemic has been added to Yukon.ca, including health care access, mental health services and the testing process.  Latest information To keep up to date with the latest information, Yukoners should visit Yukon.ca/COVID-19.

The order allows Yukon municipalities to extend their respective 2020 property tax payment deadlines. It also applies to any Local Improvement Charges that property owners are repaying.            We recognize that COVID-19 is having a financial impact on many Yukoners. Extending the property tax payment deadline is one way we are providing relief during these challenging times. We encourage those who are able to pay their property taxes this summer, to do so. Municipalities are working hard to continue providing essential services to citizens.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            The COVID-19 situation has had a significant impact on both our local and territorial economies. I want to thank Minister Streicker and the Government of Yukon for facilitating this measure for our residents, and for hopefully giving them a bit of breathing room in regard to their finances.       City of Whitehorse Mayor Dan Curtis             Quick facts       Yukon joins many other Canadian jurisdictions in providing a 60-day extension on their property tax deadlines to help property owners during this crisis.   If a municipality has already issued its tax notices, this deadline extension will apply.

Living with COVID-19 longer term Work is underway across Canada to plan a national, coordinated approach to how and when to gradually ease restrictions put in place in response to the pandemic. The slow transition to living longer-term with COVID-19 will be tailored to different contexts and implemented by each jurisdiction based on local circumstances.  Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health is a member of the federal, provincial and territorial Special Advisory Committee set up to guide this work and advise deputy ministers of health across the country on matters related to the pandemic. The committee’s work is based on data and evidence and includes developing criteria to assess readiness for loosening or altering public health measures and preparing a framework for guiding decisions. Smoking and vaping People who smoke and vape should be aware they are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and of developing more severe health complications if they become ill. Smoking and vaping damage the lungs and weaken the immune system, making it harder to fight off COVID-19. This includes smoking cannabis as well as tobacco. Also, sharing cigarettes or vaping devices risks spreading COVID-19. Yukoners wanting to give up smoking can get help from the Quitpath program by calling 867-667-8393 in Whitehorse, 1-866-221-8393 toll free in communities or by visiting www.quitpath.ca.

Each person will be given direction according to their individual circumstances. Travellers returning to Yukon People returning to Yukon who are self-isolating for 14 days and who develop symptoms or whose symptoms worsen should call 811 or their family physician if they are in Whitehorse. People in communities who develop symptoms should call their local health centre. Mental health support Mental health should be a priority for Yukoners to help them manage their way through the pandemic. Reaching out for mental wellness support is proactive health care. Advice for mental health self-care includes being kind to yourself, getting outside for at least 15 to 20 minutes a day, appreciating nature, eating well and staying hydrated, monitoring your caffeine and alcohol intake, getting eight hours of sleep a night and taking medications as prescribed.

The new case is in Whitehorse and related to international travel. Contact tracing is underway. Seven of the nine people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and no one has had to go to a hospital. Each case in Yukon so far can be traced to its origin and there continues to be no known community transmission in the territory. Community transmission is assumed to have occurred when it is no longer possible to trace how somebody became infected. Information about COVID-19 tests is published on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Testing for COVID-19 Starting today, information about COVID-19 tests will be published daily on Yukon.ca. Yukon continues to have an aggressive strategy for testing for COVID-19 but as the incidence of influenza and other respiratory illnesses lessens in the territory, fewer individuals need to be tested. Also, with fewer people coming into Yukon than before due to border restrictions, the risk of imported COVID-19 has substantially decreased. The Chief Medical Officer of Health office is continually re-examining the testing strategy for Yukon to ensure there are mechanisms in place to protect the territory’s most vulnerable citizens as well as to look for signs of community transmission. Rapid test kits Within the next couple of weeks Yukon expects to have a GeneXpert rapid test kit set up and running.  This will be for testing within a  hospital setting rather than for general use and can provide results quickly on site. New Spartan Cube machines are also expected to arrive in Yukon around the end of May for portable, rapid testing in different health care settings around the territory. The Government of Yukon will also continue to send tests to the BC Centre for Disease Control by air transport. Communal living guidance The Government of Yukon has produced a new guide to help operators prevent and manage COVID-19 in communal settings such as homeless shelters, women’s shelters, youth shelters, transition homes, group homes and hostels. The guidance includes topics such as education, cleaning, personal protective equipment and monitoring and reporting. The document is called Guidance for the Prevention and Management of COVID-19 in Communal Living Settings and is now on Yukon.ca. Keeping COVID-19 at bay Yukoners have succeeded in creating an environment where COVID-19 has not spread and are strongly advised to keep it that way by following the six steps to staying safe.

Minister of Community Services John Streicker signed the Ministerial Order under the Civil Emergency Measures Act as a means to ensure that enforcement officers stationed at Yukon’s borders have the legal authority and tools needed to deny entry to non-essential travellers while still permitting essential and critical services and people to return home. The new orders specify whom and under what circumstances entry will be permitted and require travellers entering Yukon to produce appropriate identification, documentation and a detailed self-isolation plan. These orders will not impact the delivery of critical and essential services, or the ability of people to transit through Yukon to another destination within 24 hours. Access to Yukon will need to be justified, based on purpose of travel, and the ability to meet requirements set by Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health.      Quick facts       Entry into Yukon is permitted for individuals providing acceptable evidence to an enforcement officer that they are: Yukon residents Non-resident family members of Yukon residents Delivering a critical or essential service Transiting through Yukon to a neighbouring jurisdiction (24-hour limitation) Exercising an Aboriginal or treaty right (for the time needed to exercise the right)          Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136matthew.cameron@gov.yk.ca Aisha Montgomery 	Communications, Community Services 	867-333-1-24aisha.montgomery@gov.yk.ca     News release #:   20-105    Related information:   Information for people entering Yukon  Border enforcement during COVID-19         "

As a result, Yukoners whose occupations are not considered critical or essential are not permitted to use licensed child care spaces at this time. Licensed child care will continue to be available for children with parents or guardians that are employed as critical or essential service workers, and for vulnerable families. Yukon’s licensed child care centres and family day homes are receiving additional funding to provide care to children during the COVID-19 response and beyond it. Information about this funding can be found at Yukon.ca/child-care-centres-and-family-day-homes.            Child care is an essential service that enables workers to continue to do their jobs as we manage the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, we need to ensure that child care services are available to critical or essential workers who are performing the vital services that are needed by all Yukoners in a way that protects the health and safety of both staff and children.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       In Yukon, critical services are defined as those considered critical to preserving life, health and basic societal functioning. Essential services are those required to maintain the reliable operation of infrastructure essential for the health, safety and economic well-being of Yukon’s population.  Several child care operators have space available for the children of critical and essential workers. A current list of operators with available spaces is available at Yukon.ca/child-care-information.    Details about Government of Yukon financial support for child care operators is also available at Yukon.ca/child-care-centres-and-family-day-homes.  Yukon Communicable Disease Control and Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health have provided child care operators with a public health guidance document called Enhanced measures at Yukon child care facilities during the COVID-19 crisis. It details measures to assist our centres and day homes in remaining open, to help maintain a safe and healthy environment and to minimize the risk of COVID-19 in Yukon.

In Yukon, individuals can file advance directives. An advance directive allows an individual of any age to plan for an unexpected illness or accident that leaves them unable to communicate the kind of health care and support they want, or don’t want. An advance directive names a substitute decision maker who can speak on their behalf. It is a written statement of an individual's values and how they'd like to be cared for when acutely ill or near the end of their life.            On National Advance Care Planning Day, I encourage all Yukoners to make a plan for what they want to happen in the unfortunate event that they are unable to communicate their wishes. It is not a thought we want to entertain but it is important that we do so and plan appropriately. Today is also an important opportunity to highlight those who work in the area of palliative care for the quality care they provide.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Today gives us the opportunity to remind people of the importance of planning ahead. As physicians who work with palliative patients, we are most often there at the end. If a patient has a plan and their families are aware of that plan, it can be such a gentler end.  Family and caregivers should know what an individual’s wishes are.      Palliative care physician Dr. Danusia Kanachowski             Quick facts       The Care Consent Act deals with consent and substitute consent to health care and sets out the requirements for a valid advance directive.  Anyone over the age of 16 who is capable, can make a directive which appoints a proxy and sets out future health care wishes.

The Permit Hunt Authorization lottery application period will open on April 23. The deadline is May 21, 2020 at 4 p.m. Changes to the Permit Hunt Authorization include the following. Joint permit hunt authorization applications will now enter into the draw as the average of years applied for the two applicants. The number of Takhini elk permits available will increase from two to four. Successful applicants will be emailed before the end of June. Successful applicants now have the option to return their permit online, through their Department of Environment eServices account. Other hunting regulation changes in effect for the 2020–21 season include the following.  Youth under 12 years of age no longer require the Hunter Education and Ethics Development (HEED) course for small game licences. Subzones 7-13, 7-17, 7-20, 7-24 and 7-26 will be on permit for sheep hunting rather than having to select an individual subzone. Permits in the eastern portion of Game Management Zone 7 will be allocated by Sheep Management Units that reflect sheep populations and movements, which will provide sheep permit holders more flexibility. A portion of game management subzone 5-21 will be closed permanently to sheep hunting. This closure helps to protect the Kluane National Park sheep population. The Government of Yukon will reassess the feasibility of the Special Guide Licence in May. The application period is delayed due to travel restrictions in response to COVID-19. Hunters are encouraged to follow the advice from Yukon's Chief Medical Officer of Health regarding travel recommendations and restrictions as well as physical distancing practices when planning their hunts. The most up-to-date information is available online at Yukon.ca/hunting.            We are committed to continually improving the permit hunt authorization to ensure a transparent and modern process. I am pleased we were able to make the weighting change to joint applications, which Yukoners supported during a public review in 2019. In light of the ongoing response to COVID-19, I encourage all hunters to take extra time to plan their hunts with physical distancing and the wishes of our communities in mind. Have a successful and enjoyable season on the land.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       The Permit Hunt Authorization (PHA) underwent a comprehensive review in 2019, which included a public survey, stakeholder meetings, and a third-party technical review of the data and systems.  In 2019 the Department of Environment received more than 4,700 applications for 223 PHA permits covering six species.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 14, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon remains at eight with seven cases in Whitehorse and one in a community. Six of the eight people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and no one has had to go to a hospital. Each case in Yukon so far can be traced to its origin and there continues to be no known community transmission in the territory. Community transmission is presumed to occur when it is no longer possible to trace how somebody became infected. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Easter success Yukoners are thanked for following the pandemic orders and recommendations over the Easter weekend and staying close to home, staying safe and not putting unnecessary pressure on medical and emergency services. Six steps to staying safe Although community transmission is not known to have reached the territory yet, it is possible that it has already arrived. This is why the public should continue to act to limit potential infection. By following six steps to staying safe, Yukoners will help to stop the spread of COVID-19. Practise physical distancing – keep two metres or six feet away from everyone who’s not in your household. Wash your hands frequently. Stay home when you’re sick. Don’t gather in groups of 10 or more people. Don’t travel to communities unless it’s essential. Self-isolate when you’re required to – either because you’ve travelled into the territory or because you are a contact of someone diagnosed with or being investigated for COVID-19. Doctor appointments and immunizations People who would normally be visiting health centres for immunizations should carry on doing so despite the pandemic. Those with ailments or conditions not related to COVID-19 should call their doctors for appointments in the usual way. They will be able to talk to their doctor by phone and their doctor will determine whether they need a face to face appointment.

This Order represents the first implementation action of the approved Peel Watershed Regional Land Use Plan, developed and approved in partnership with the First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun, Vuntut Gwitchin Government, Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, and Gwich’in Tribal Council. As of April 1, 2020, mineral staking in areas identified as Special Management Areas were withdrawn permanently. Wilderness Areas and Wilderness Areas-Boreal Caribou have an interim withdrawal in place until January 1, 2030, at which point the status of these Areas will be jointly reviewed by the Parties to the Peel Plan. The mineral staking withdrawals for the Integrated Management Areas were lifted April 1, 2020. However, anyone considering a project in the Peel must be aware that standards for environmental and cultural stewardship are higher in this area than they are on other Crown lands in Yukon. All mineral exploration and development proposals, including Class 1 notifications, will be subject to conformity checks to ensure compliance with the Plan. Proposals and notifications that do not comply with the Plan will not proceed until they are brought into conformity. The Parties to the Peel Watershed Regional Land Use Plan are committed to honouring the commitments they have made to each other and the people of Yukon.            The tremendous work to finalize the Peel Regional Land Use Plan was a high point in Yukon’s history, and the hard work to implement the plan is following in this same path of positive collaboration. The plan provides clarity for conservation and resource activity in the region, and we will continue to work together to ensure that the special values of the Peel are maintained forever.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            The Peel Land Use Plan has been a long journey for all of us, and we are pleased to finally reach the first steps of implementation through a collaborative approach on activities for Integrated Management and Special Management Areas. Although the standards are robust, we need to ensure we leave a good legacy for future generations and the ability to use the Peel region in a way that we are able to use it today.      Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Chief Roberta Joseph            We are happy to be working with the Government of Yukon and our fellow First Nations to introduce new standards for industrial development in the Peel that respect the values of our ancestors. One hundred years from now our great-great-grandchildren will be proud of what we’ve done.      First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun Chief Simon Mervyn             The Peel Watershed Regional Land Use Plan is the result of years of hard work by our people in collaboration with our neighbouring First Nations and the Yukon Government. It ensures our current and future generations would enjoy the same rights as we do today. Implementation is the next important step. The Gwich’in Tribal Council looks forward to continued collaboration in ensuring the Peel Watershed is managed with the respect for Gwich’in values.      Gwich’in Tribal Council Grand Chief Bobbie Jo Greenland-Morgan            Public support from Yukoners for the protection of the Peel has been substantial and unwavering. We saw this for years as Yukoners defended the preservation of its beautiful landscape and we saw it during the public signing ceremony of the Peel Watershed Regional Land Use Plan. We’ve made great strides in implementing the Plan, but we’re not at the finish line yet, and we know we have the support of the public to ensure the spirit and intent of the plan are implemented, fully and truly.      Vuntut Gwitchin Chief Dana Tizya-Tramm            Quick facts       Prior to these changes, the Peel Watershed planning region was withdrawn from mineral staking to varying degrees since 2010.  New withdrawal orders also apply to oil and gas dispositions.   The Governments of Yukon, Nacho Nyak Dun, Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, Vuntut Gwitchin, and Gwich’in Tribal Council are committed to jointly implementing the recommendations in the Plan, and making land and resource decisions that are consistent with the goals and General Management Direction of the Plan. For example: 		Adequate baseline data, for example; heritage resource, fish, wildlife, waterbird, habitat, water quality, will be required prior to any development. New surface access will require sufficient bonding to achieve full reclamation. Public access on new roads will not be allowed. No development activities will be allowed in important subsistence harvesting and current community use areas, or in areas with important cultural and heritage resources. Any all-season infrastructure must be located a minimum of 100 meters from wetlands and lakes. Activities must not be carried out in sensitive over-wintering and spawning areas. Cumulative surface disturbance will be limited by predetermined thresholds. Activities will be monitored and limits to cumulative impacts established and enforced.

The Yukon Business Relief Program will help Yukon businesses that have experienced a 30 per cent reduction in revenue and require immediate relief. Eligible businesses can apply for a grant of up to $30,000 per month to cover fixed costs from March 23 to May 22, 2020. The program is in line with the recommendation from the recently established Business Advisory Council. The Government of Yukon is working with industry organizations and the local business community to support Yukon businesses and workers impacted by COVID-19. The Government of Yukon continues to work with the Government of Canada to assess economic impacts and support our economy. This program is the latest Government of Yukon initiative to support Yukon’s business sector and is anticipated to cost up to $10 million. This brings the government’s economic supports to as much as $21.7 million. Other supports include the Paid Sick Leave Program, the Temporary Support for Events Funding Program as well as changes to the Yukon Nominee Program previously announced.              Yukon businesses need support to manage through this difficult time. The measures necessary to protect the health and safety of Yukoners in response to COVID-19 are having a significant impact on Yukon’s businesses. This funding provides needed relief to businesses experiencing hardship and enhance their ability to rebound in the future.

Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 8, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon is eight. The eighth case is in a rural Yukon community. The patient is self-isolating and doing well at home. This case is linked to international travel. Four of the eight people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have now recovered and no one has had to go to a hospital. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Identifying rural communities where COVID-19 is present When a case is diagnosed in a rural community, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health will not publicly identify the community. This commitment is made for several reasons including the need to protect the personal health information and privacy of the individual and anyone affected. Individual cases that are contained do not increase the risk to the public. There is concern that if communities are identified, the community or people who are affected may be stigmatized. If there are specific places where contact may have occurred and contacts are unknown, those locations may need to be posted regardless of the community. Easter weekend  Yukoners are reminded to do what they can to help stop the spread of COVID-19 over the Easter weekend so the territory remains free of known community transmission. This means staying close to home, avoiding activities that risk the need for emergency services to be called out and keeping a safe, two-metre distance from anyone who’s not a member of the same household. People should do grocery and other shopping alone as much as possible and not play sports or games with people who are not from the same household. However, Yukoners who are healthy and not self-isolating should not take this to mean they cannot see local family and friends who are not vulnerable to infection. Yukoners connecting with others should keep safely spaced at all times, practise greater hygiene and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. As announced on March 22, people are strongly advised not to travel to Yukon rural communities unless their journey is essential. Playgrounds Healthy Yukoners are also reminded that they may go to local parks and playgrounds to get fresh air and play as long as they keep safely spaced from anyone who’s not in their household. As territorial campgrounds are closed, the playgrounds in these sites are also closed. Doctor appointments People with ailments or conditions not related to COVID-19 are encouraged to call their doctors for appointments in the usual way. They can talk to their doctor by phone and their doctor will determine whether a face to face appointment is necessary. Anyone who thinks they have COVID-19 symptoms should call Yukon HealthLine 811 or use the COVID-19 self-assessment tool on Yukon.ca. Schools With face-to-face classes suspended for the rest of the school year, parents and caregivers are encouraged to help children continue to learn but in the role of a guide rather than putting pressure on themselves to step into the role of a teacher.  Tips for supporting children at this challenging time include talking to them about COVID-19 while also restricting their access to online news about the pandemic, maintaining a regular daily structure and teaching children the basics of increased hygiene while not becoming upset if they forget.

The Government of Yukon has signed a contract with eSolutions Group to develop an online eProcurement system that will decrease paper bids, flag compliance errors for bidders, and improve spending analysis across government. The new online system will streamline the procurement process with features including: Electronic bidding that includes business registration, tender notifications and electronic submissions for suppliers; Contract creation that meets the standards of government financial systems; Spend analytics for reporting and planning, leading to more strategic procurement and greater transparency; and Vendor performance review program management that includes a two-way evaluation and tracking of contract performance. The eProcurement system will launch this summer with a phased implementation. Businesses currently registered on the Tender Management System will receive training as part of the transition to the new system.            A faster and more accessible, reliable and transparent tendering system will allow for more strategic procurement that maximizes economic benefit for Yukoners.

Student learning will continue through alternative learning opportunities starting on April 16 for the remainder of the school year. Yukon Learning Continuity Requirements have been developed and shared with Yukon schools to inform plans for at-home learning throughout the territory. The Department of Education worked with the British Columbia Ministry of Education and a committee of educators and central administration staff to develop the new requirements. School principals and teachers are using these requirements to identify essential learning that needs to be covered for the remainder of the school year, develop learning plans to ensure continued learning and communicate with students and families. Schools are currently planning how to deliver at-home student learning with traditional and online resources. Learning plans are being tailored to the unique needs of each individual school community and will incorporate a variety of ways to provide learning opportunities, including for families who may not have access to technology. These plans may look different in each Yukon school. Each school will work with families before April 15 on how they will deliver at-home learning and complete the most essential learning starting April 16 through the remainder of the school year.            The health and safety of students, staff and communities is our first priority. The dedicated staff in Yukon schools are working diligently to adapt and ensure student learning continues during this unprecedented time. I want to acknowledge and thank the educators, principals and central administration staff for all their efforts to support student learning. I also want to thank and acknowledge the efforts of students, parents and families for their patience and understanding as we all adjust to new realities. Together we will continue to meet the learning needs of Yukon students.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            I have worked closely with the Department of Education to reach the best decision for the protection of students and staff. Learning and health will always be partners. Even as face to face classes are suspended, the learning will continue.  It will be challenging for all, for teachers, students and parents and guardians, but by taking this step now, we are protecting the future.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       Schools will prioritize essential learning for the remainder of the school year based on the following principles for each grade level: Learning Together and Early Kindergarten (K4): Provide opportunities and resources for students to engage in learning through play, inquiry and hands-on experiences while supporting gross and fine motor development, oral language and social skills. Assign about three hours for each student per week to engage in this type of learning.  Kindergarten to Grade 6:  Provide opportunities and resources for students to engage in building literacy and numeracy skills across the subject areas and the personal and social competencies of the curriculum. Assign about five hours of work per week for each student.  Grades 7 to 9:  Provide opportunities and resources for students to engage in building literacy and numeracy skills across the subject areas and the personal and social competencies of the curriculum. Assign about ten hours of work per week for each student.  Grades 10 to 12:  Provide activities, resources and supports for students to develop the learning standards’ competencies and understandings prioritized so students have the opportunity to be successful in all their current courses. Assign about three hours of work per course for each student each week. Work with Grade 12 students to identify those who need to complete the Grade 10 numeracy assessment and ensure they meet this requirement.   Yukon schools continue to be used by teachers and staff, but remain unavailable to students and user groups at this time.  At this time, there are no changes to the 2019–20 or 2020–21 school calendars. The 2020–21 school calendars are now posted on Yukon.ca/school-holiday-dates and are being shared with schools.

598,2020-04-06,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/parks-and-campgrounds-opening-delayed-until-june,Government Website,Parks and campgrounds opening delayed until June,"           Published 06/04/2020        The Government of Yukon is delaying the opening of territorial parks and campgrounds and sale of camping permits until June to protect the public, staff and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. All campgrounds and facilities that were open, but un-serviced, are now closed until further notice. The Government of Yukon will continue to work with the office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and reassess the situation in May to determine if opening parks and campgrounds is in the best interest of Yukoners’ health and safety. People may still use park trails and green spaces for recreation while practising physical distancing and following other requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Please use significant caution engaging in any activities that could put you at risk of not following physical distancing or put you in a position that requires outside assistance. Backcountry activities are strongly discouraged in order to keep rescue and safety resources available during this time. Yukoners are being asked to avoid popular recreation areas where physical distancing may not be possible or where people may find themselves in a gathering greater then 10 people. Yukoners are also reminded to remove all garbage when using trails and green spaces.            We know camping and being in our parks is beloved by Yukoners and delaying the opening is a tough decision to make. We need to put the health and safety of users and staff first and will carefully reassess the situation in the coming weeks. My hope is that the efforts being taken now to curb the spread of COVID-19 will put us in a position to open campgrounds later this year.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Yukon’s system of territorial parks includes wilderness parks, campgrounds, recreation sites and others.  The Government of Yukon maintains 42 campgrounds with more than 1,000 campsites, 12 recreation sites and six larger wilderness parks like Tombstone. Campgrounds are normally fully serviced from May 15 to September 13, and 12 select campgrounds from May 8 to September 27.  The use of territorial parks has more than doubled in the past decade. Use of campgrounds increased 103 per cent and backcountry camping in Tombstone territorial park increased 137 per cent.    The Government of Yukon is working to finalize the Yukon Parks Strategy. The strategy will outline strategic actions and priorities for the next 10 years.

As of 8 a.m. on Monday, April 6, Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) Enforcement Officers have been placed at Yukon borders and at the Whitehorse airport as a measure to ensure that all travelers have the information they need to keep themselves and Yukoners safe from the spread of COVID-19. These Government of Yukon enforcement officers will be collecting contact information of all travelers coming through Yukon or returning home, details of their 14-day self-isolation plans, and declarations of any symptoms of COVID-19. This information will allow CEMA Enforcement Officers to follow up and ensure that travelers are following self-isolation rules. CEMA Enforcement Officers will be stationed at: Weigh scales on the Alaska Highway south of Watson Lake Weigh scales at the junction of the Alaska Highway and the Stewart-Cassiar Highway Whitehorse airport The CEMA Enforcement Officers are also coordinating support for these measures with Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) and officials in the Northwest Territories (NWT) for the following border crossings: Fraser, BC border crossing Pleasant Camp, BC border crossing Beaver Creek border crossing Yukon-NWT border on the Dempster Highway Anyone traveling into or through Yukon is required to self-isolate for 14 days. People transiting through Yukon to Alaska, NWT or other parts of Canada are required to complete their transit in Yukon within 24 hours of their entry, and shall avoid unnecessary contact with others when they stop for food or fuel. All Yukoners are reminded to practice safe physical distancing and to stay two metres (six feet) away from people outside of their household, wash their hands regularly, and cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue.      Quick facts       The Beaver Creek boarder is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Fraser boarder is open from 8 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week. The Pleasant Camp border is open from 8 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week.   Conservation Officers and Natural Resources Officers are being deployed at the Watson Lake border crossings to act as Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) enforcement officers. These officers have the necessary training from their substantive duties and are also being trained on their additional authorities under the Civil Emergency Measures Act.   Other government officials are being utilized at Whitehorse Airport to meet incoming flights.  There will be no enforcement officers at the border between Atlin, BC and Yukon, as Atlin residents are exempted from the need to self-isolate, as long as they haven’t traveled outside of Yukon or Atlin in the past 14 days. The same exemptions also apply to residents of Lower Post, Fire Side, Jade City, Fraser and Pleasant Camp.  Plans are in place to make sure that services of Conservation Officers and Natural Resources Officers will also continue.

600,2020-04-06,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/april-6-2020-yukons-chief-medical-officer-health-provides-update-covid-19,Government Website,"April 6, 2020: Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health provides update on COVID-19","           Published 06/04/2020        Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 6, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon is seven. Four of the seven people who have contracted COVID-19 have now recovered and all others are isolating and doing well at home. No Yukon cases have required medical treatment. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Contact tracing Whenever new cases of COVID-19 occur in the territory that can be traced to a particular person, the Government of Yukon will contact anyone who has had close contact with that individual. This is called contact tracing and is a normal, precautionary step in the response to any infectious disease, not just COVID-19. Yukoners who have had close contact with someone who is infected will be notified individually and the steps they need to take will be explained to them directly, such as monitoring themselves for symptoms and self-isolating. The risk of infection is determined case by case by Yukon Communicable Disease Control. COVID-19 transmission Yukon continues to have no known cases of community transmission. All identified infections in the territory so far are connected to travel outside Yukon or to known contacts. Community transmission occurs when it is no longer possible to trace how somebody became infected. Physical spacing measures are people’s best protection against unknown community transmission. With global information about COVID-19 growing each day there is now evidence that some infected people can transmit the virus before they develop symptoms and also that some people who never develop symptoms can also transmit the virus. Personal protective equipment Yukon is not facing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). To help manage resources, PPE supplies in the territory have been centralized and health care workers are following protocols so that equipment is neither over-used nor under-used. Supplies of medical masks must continue to be given to health care workers so they can wear them during medical procedures and when they care for people who are infected. Wearing a non-medical mask such as a homemade cloth mask in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it. However, using non-medical mask or facial covering can be an additional measure people can take to protect others around them. It also helps people to be aware of not spreading infection and remember to not touch their face. Wearing a non-medical mask when in public or other settings is not a replacement for following proven measures such as hand washing and safe spacing. Safe Easter recreation Yukoners are strongly advised to choose less risky outdoor activities close to home this Easter weekend. The territory’s first responders and medical system workers need to be available to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic rather than attend to outdoor activity injuries. Latest information A range of information in response to people’s queries about the pandemic is being added today to Yukon.ca. To keep up to date with the latest information, Yukoners are encouraged to visit Yukon.ca/COVID-19.

The Government of Yukon will cover staff wages as well as eligible building expenses, including rent, utilities and cleaning costs. The funding will support child care operators and enable them to avoid charging parent fees as Yukon responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a child care centre remains open, the Direct Operating Grant will provide 100 per cent of eligible building costs for March, April, May and June 2020, as well as wages for all working staff, including the employer’s contribution for Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan and the Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board. If a child care centre is closed, the grant will cover 100 per cent of eligible building costs for March, April, May and June 2020. Staff are encouraged to access supports from the Government of Canada. If a family day home remains open, its grant will increase by 50 per cent for March, April, May and June 2020 and it will receive full funding for all established spaces regardless of whether the spaces are full. If a day home is closed, the grant will suspend until it reopens. Owners are encouraged to access supports from the federal government until they can reopen. Child care operators may also be eligible for additional financial support for supplies or services they require to operate during the COVID-19 response. Operators are encouraged to work with their child care inspector to determine eligibility. At this time, parents and guardians who typically rely on child care services are asked to keep their children at home if possible. Parents who are working from home should keep their children with them. This will make spaces available for people who provide essential services or who cannot work from home.            Child care is an essential service for vulnerable children and families as well as the workers who must continue to do their jobs as we manage the spread of COVID-19. Our government is committed to supporting child care operators to continue to provide services during this challenging time in a way that ensures the health and safety of both staff and children.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Several child care operators have space available for Yukon families in need of child care services for essential workers only. Up-to-date information, including a list of operators with space for children, will be available online soon.  Yukon Communicable Disease Control and Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health have provided child care operators with a public health guidance document called Enhanced measures at Yukon child care facilities during the COVID-19 crisis. It details measures to assist our centres and day homes in remaining open, to help maintain a safe and healthy environment and to minimize the risk of COVID-19 in Yukon  Parents and guardians are being asked to complete a daily screening questionnaire before they take their children to a day care. If certain criteria are met, parents and guardians will be asked to keep their children at home.

The Government of Yukon will provide 325 phones with capability for voice and internet access to vulnerable women for the next four months. This will give women options to safely access the support they need. Physical distancing and self-isolation measures mean that individuals may be required to stay in close quarters with someone who is violent. The closure of some public spaces and community service agencies has limited the ability to access safe internet connections, which are key to getting support, contacting family and friends, accessing counselling and accessing financial support. Mobile phones with internet access will help address this need. The Yukon Status of Women Council will be working with other community partners to distribute the phones to women who do not currently have cell phone or internet access, with a focus on those who are experiencing violence or at risk of violence.            In light of COVID-19, people are acting responsibly by practising social distancing, staying home and self-isolating when needed. Although this is important, it may cause unsafe situations for people who are experiencing violence, are at risk or who need support. This program provides a way for women to access supports, connect with their loved ones and apply for emergency funding programs. I am so grateful for this partnership to make this program available to those in need.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie Dendys             It is imperative that Yukon women have access to the internet - especially those living in precarious situations. As the COVID-19 situation evolves, more stringent lockdown measures will have a disproportionate impact on marginalized women. One of the only access points to basic necessities and service like money, food, medication, information - and for some, safety itself - will be through an internet or phone connection.      Director of the Yukon Status of Women Council Aja Mason            Quick facts       Rates of violence against women in Yukon are three times higher than the national average.  One out of three women experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. Women make up the majority of victims of domestic violence, with LGBTQ2S+ individuals also facing elevated rates of domestic violence. During times of crisis like COVID-19, risk of gender-based violence escalates.  Yukoners can drop off working cell phones that are no longer needed to the Yukon Status of Women Council office at 308 Hanson Street in Whitehorse.  Victims of sexualized violence can call the Sexualized Assault Support Line at 1-844-967-7275.  Anyone interested in donating a phone should contact the Yukon Status of Women Council at aja.mason@yswc.ca to make arrangements.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 3, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon remains at six. Four of the six people who contracted COVID-19 have now recovered and all others are isolating and doing well at home. No Yukon cases have required medical treatment.

Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Legal orders As announced by the Government of Yukon on April 2, 2020, Yukoners should be aware that all orders put in place by the Yukon Chief Medical Officer in response to the pandemic are enforceable by law. This announcement about enforcement measures was in recognition of the vulnerability of communities throughout Yukon and will help clarify the rules for anyone who is uncertain about what they and others can and cannot legally do. The enforceable orders require that: everyone who enters Yukon must self-isolate for 14 days; all essential services workers must self-isolate in a place other than a work camp or mine; all people entering Yukon must provide contact information and details of their self-isolation plan and declare they don’t have any COVID-19 symptoms; no more than 10 people can gather in the same place unless they live together; all restaurants that remain open must only provide take out; all bars must close; dental visits are limited to emergency only; and all personal service businesses such as hair salons, tattoo parlours and massage therapy must close. Special provisions and requirements are now in place for critical service providers, people travelling through Yukon and people who live in the BC-Yukon border area who haven’t travelled out of the territory or border area in the last 14 days. Travellers are only allowed to be in Yukon for 24 hours as they pass through. Recommendations To help protect Yukoners since the start of the pandemic, the Chief Medical Officer of Health has made several strong recommendations as well as orders. These recommendations include: not travelling to rural communities or outside the territory unless it’s essential; practicing greater hygiene and always keeping at least two meters apart from others unless they’re part of the same household; working from home when possible; and avoiding non-essential treatment at hospitals.  Hospital care Yukoners are reminded that hospitals are still very safe places to seek care. If people need to see a doctor for their illness, medical condition or injury they should call 811 first. If they’re advised to go to Emergency then they should do so. Yukoners should also be aware that no hospital visitors are allowed except in limited circumstances and that active screening is in place at the entrances to all hospitals. Screeners have the difficult but important job of ensuring people have access to urgent care and keeping everyone safe. This means they may have to redirect people to other health service or turn away visitors. This is not an easy measure to enforce and Yukoners are asked to be understanding that these steps are being taken to ensure everyone’s safety. Rural communities To help protect rural communities in Yukon from the pandemic, the Chief Medical Officer of Health also now strongly recommends that all service providers engage with local or municipal and First Nations governments before they enter any communities. A Government of Yukon team is being established to support this engagement. Work is also underway to help ensure that Yukoners across the territory are kept up to date with COVID-19 developments and advice in a range of ways, in recognition that not everyone has easy access to online information. Critical and essential services To support orders and recommendations made by Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health during the pandemic, the Government of Yukon has published guidelines that explain what critical and essential services are in the context of the pandemic and state the measures that businesses and workers must take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the territory. Critical workers are defined as those whose services are necessary to preserve life, health and the basic running of society, such as health care, emergency services, energy, water and food. Essential workers are defined as those whose services support the infrastructure needed for the health, safety and economic wellbeing of Yukoners, such as transportation, construction, and information and communication technologies. The new guidelines also identify other services that are essential, for example, long-term care facility workers, child care workers, veterinarians and cleaning services. Guidance on self-isolating  Yukoners who are self-isolating are reminded that they may go outdoors for fresh air or exercise and to carry out urgent errands such as collecting medication if no one else can do this for them, as long as they keep a distance of at least two meters – or six feet – from other people. Safe spacing is not a law in Yukon but a strong recommendation and common sense during the pandemic. All Yukoners have a responsibility to help stop the spread of COVID-19 with the territory.

They have been negotiating through a joint settlement committee since August 2015. The two parties worked collaboratively through this committee to resolve issues that were raised during the court case about French First Language education in Yukon. The settlement committee was composed of six members, three nominated by each party. The Government of Yukon and Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon worked together to clarify the roles and responsibilities in managing French First Language education in Yukon in a way that respects the requirements of both the Yukon Education Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in regard to minority language education rights. A significant outcome of this process has been the agreement on building a new French First Language secondary school, which will provide additional learning spaces, including a gymnasium, and facilities for these programs and the community.            The settlement of this case is a very positive achievement. Our government worked with the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon to make important changes for French First Language education in Yukon. I am proud of the renewed partnership and look forward to our work together to support French First Language students, and all students in Yukon.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            We are very pleased to have reached a settlement with the Government of Yukon. Through the various agreements we have negotiated, we have created a made-in-Yukon solution and established a solid foundation for the partnership between the CSFY and the Government of Yukon for the provision of French First Language education programs in the territory. We look forward to continuing our collaboration to support our students and their learning while respecting minority education rights.      Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon President Jean-Sébastien Blais            Quick facts       The court case was filed in 2009 regarding the Government of Yukon’s obligations under s.23 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

This now ensures that orders given by the Chief Medical Officer of Health are enforceable under the Civil Emergency Measures Act. Today’s action also defines critical and essential services in a new set of guidelines. The guidelines will provide Yukoners and critical service providers the clarity needed to determine who can safely travel and work throughout the territory. To date, the Chief Medical Officer of Health has given several orders, including orders to self-isolate upon return to Yukon from travel, closing bars, defining gathering sizes and limiting restaurants to take-out service only. These and other orders issued are now enforceable under the Civil Emergency Measures Act which means government can issue fines and possibly jail time if individuals do not comply. The Government of Yukon will be requiring travellers who enter Yukon by land or air to stop upon entry and complete a travel declaration and check in with an enforcement officer before entering the territory. This will ensure that proper self-isolation measures and orders shared with every traveller and can be enforced if necessary. Non-residents who must transit through Yukon to Alaska or Northwest Territories or another part of Canada may do so but may only remain in Yukon for no more than 24 hours. Yukon’s Emergency Coordination Centre is preparing to implement enforcement at entry points to Yukon, which will be mobilized in the coming days. Also being released today is the Government of Yukon’s guidelines for critical, essential and non-essential service workers. This guidelines document will help local and non-local workers understand how to comply with the rules and protect themselves and Yukoners from COVID-19. The requirement for self-isolation applies to all essential services workers, with a limited number of exemptions for residents of specified BC-Yukon border communities and critical service workers who must cross the border, outlined within the orders issued under the Civil Emergency Measures Act.            Protecting Yukoners and Yukon communities from the spread of COVID-19 is our highest priority right now. The steps we are taking today enforce the orders made by the Chief Medical Officer of Health, and provide clearer guidance to Yukoners who are wondering how they should continue to do their jobs. We are taking tangible steps to protect Yukoners and Yukon communities while also continuing to offer the critical services Yukoners and our neighbours in BC-Yukon border communities need.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Yukoners have been taking great strides to protect our communities and I thank them for all of the sacrifices they are making. That said, there will always be individuals who see themselves as exempt from these orders. Today’s action gives government the ability to enforce and penalize people who do not comply. We must all work to keep Yukon safe.      Minister of Justice Tracy McPhee            Quick facts       A full list of the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s orders and advice can be found on Yukon.ca/changes-legislation-covid-19. Orders are enforceable under the Civil Emergency Measures Act. Advice or recommendations are not enforceable. The Government of Yukon strongly encourages Yukoners to follow all recommendations from the Chief Medical Officer of Health to the best of their abilities.  Anyone entering Yukon will need to check in with an enforcement officer and fill out an information card that includes their destination, contact information and any stops along the way. This will allow enforcement officers to follow up to ensure self-isolation measures are properly taken.  An individual who is not a resident in Yukon may transit through the territory to their final destination, and may not remain in Yukon for more than 24 hours after entry.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 1, at 3 p.m. there are six cases of COVID-19 in Yukon. The new case is linked to international travel. The individual followed all proper protocols, self-isolated and is recovering at home. Three of the six people who contracted COVID-19 have now recovered and all others are doing well on home isolation. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Air travellers Air North staff are greeting all travellers arriving at Erik Neilson Whitehorse International Airport with any airline to give them guidance and instruct them that they must self-isolate for 14 days and monitor themselves for symptoms. Passengers also receive guidance before they deplane and COVID-19 information is displayed on airport screens. All people arriving in Yukon are ordered to go straight home and into self-isolation for 14 days. If they cannot safely self-isolate at home, they should contact COVID19info@gov.yk.ca to be linked with the team supporting people who cannot self-isolate at home. Support for vulnerable people Several measures are in place at the Government of Yukon’s Whitehorse Emergency Shelter to help keep guests and staff safe during the pandemic. This includes actively monitoring guests for symptoms of COVID-19 and reducing the number of people gathering in the shelter at the same time, while still providing essential services and prioritizing people who are most in need. Whitehorse Emergency Shelter staff are also carrying out safe spacing and additional cleaning to prevent the spread of infection and are educating guests about physical distancing, increased hygiene and coughing etiquette. Staff have accommodation ready for guests who may need to isolate and are helping people who don’t require additional support to find alternative, temporary accommodation. In addition, the Government of Yukon is sharing guidance and resources such as a screening tool with non-governmental organizations across the territory that provides services for homeless people and those at risk of homelessness so they can help protect clients, staff and volunteers. Work camp guidelines Guidelines have been issued for work camps during the pandemic, including how to help staff who have symptoms or who are required to self-isolate, how to practice safe spacing and enhanced hygiene, and how to handle food. It is recommended that employers pay staff who need to self-isolate as this will help ensure that staff report any COVID-19 symptoms and follow isolation protocols. Mining camp workers arriving in Yukon are reminded that they are required to self-isolate for 14 days before they start work.

Minister Pillai announced the Temporary Support for Events Funding Program, which will help businesses recover certain costs from the cancellation of major events due to COVID-19. Major events are those which would have had gatherings of more than 50 people, such as the Arctic Winter Games or Yukon Native Hockey Tournament. These costs relate specifically to perishable goods and the cancellation of accommodation and services. All eligible Yukon businesses and NGOs may apply. The Government of Yukon is taking a targeted approach to supporting Yukon businesses and workers impacted by COVID-19. We continue to work with all stakeholders, including the Government of Canada, to assess the economic impacts and support our economy.            The Government of Yukon continues to develop and implement measures to actively support Yukon businesses and NGOs during this challenging time. This support program targets losses around the cancellation of major events, such as the Arctic Winter Games.

The Independent Expert Panel requested this extension, citing circumstantial challenges due to COVID-19 as the reason for this request.  Most members of the comprehensive review secretariat, including the director, have been called to work on a response to COVID-19 by various agencies including the Government of Yukon. Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost granted the panel’s requested extension, moving the deadline from March 31 to April 30, 2020.            We are all affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As we work together to mitigate the effects this will have on Yukoners, other projects may be impacted. This extension will allow key staff to continue important work to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending and the total number of tests. Hospital preparedness Whitehorse General Hospital continues to prepare for the pandemic. They are planning now on how to potentially accommodate a high volume of COVID-19 patients, including identifying other facilities where care could be provided. They are also putting physical distancing measures in place and planning for the effective management of resources such as staff, equipment and supplies. Contact tracing People who test positive for COVID-19 may have a history of a flight or flights within the preceding 14 days. In such cases, the Government of Yukon will use information from the airline, when available, to contact only the people on that flight who were sitting specifically within the range of the infected individual. People identified within that range are directly contacted and required to monitor themselves for symptoms. If they develop symptoms they must immediately self-isolate and contact Yukon Communicable Disease Control. This is a precautionary approach to account for any possible transmission on flights and avoids the publication of flight information. When flight manifest information is not available, the public posting of flight information may be required. Safe spacing Keeping two metres apart from other people is one of the most effective ways to help stop the spread of COVID-19. This behaviour has been referred to as “social distancing” but this language is shifting to the phrases “physical distancing” and “safe spacing” as that wording is clearer and easier for people to visualize and act on. Yukoners are reminded that other powerful ways to help stop the spread of COVID-19 are frequent handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding face touching.

Where possible, we are asking the public to clean and store recycling until services resume. Alternatively, put your recycling in your household waste. E-waste drop-offs at Raven Recycling and rural recycling depots will remain open during this time. The introduction of tipping fees at the waste facilities in Carcross, Tagish, Mount Lorne, Marsh Lake and Deep Creek will be delayed until recycling services resume. Meanwhile, illegal dumping fines will increase on April 1, 2020. Increasing fines for offences under the Environment Act and the Solid Waste Regulations are needed because fines are out of date and too low to be a meaningful penalty.            Suspending recycling services is not something we would have hoped for. However, we all need to take every measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the territory. We encourage Yukoners to stay two metres apart from other people when they go to the dump, and to wash their hands thoroughly before and after their visit. Now is a great time to be creative about re-using your recyclables - for example, you could use egg cartons for seed trays as we get ready for spring gardening.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            The Government of Yukon has set significant penalties to discourage illegal dumping. There is no place for garbage and hazardous waste in our wild spaces, ditches or waterways. While these fines were planned to take effect before having to respond to COVID-19, we appreciate the extra diligence and effort from Yukoners to manage their waste legally and responsibly.        Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Some rural depots may have already closed. Contact your local recycling depot to make sure they are open before you plan to drop off your recycling.  Unlawful handling/disposing of solid waste is going up from $200 to $1,000. Littering is going up from $50 to $500. Find a full list of fines on Yukon.ca/en/illegal-dumping  Whitehorse Blue Bin Recycling will continue to offer roadside collection of paper products only.  Raven Recycling closed their public drop off on March 25. P&M Recycling also closed their depot on March 23.  If you are choosing to store your recycling until services resume, make sure it is in a cool, dry, indoor location, secure from wildlife.  Do not leave your refundable bottles or beverage containers at the recycling depot. Choose to store them securely until recycling resumes or put them in your household garbage.

COVID-19 cases and test results As of today, March 27, at 3 p.m. there are four cases of COVID-19 in Yukon. All four people are doing well at home. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending and the total number of tests. Managing COVID-19 cases As new cases of COVID-19 occur, those who are connected to infected people will continue to be traced and informed so they can take the necessary measures of monitoring themselves for symptoms for up to 14 days. Yukoners are urged to behave as if COVID-19 is already in their community. They should continue to keep a physical distance of two meters or six feet from each other and practice greater hygiene. Yukoners are also strongly advised to avoid passing on inaccurate information they may hear about cases of infection. This creates additional anxiety at a time when many people are already struggling to maintain their mental health.  Federal quarantine measures As many Yukoners will know, the Government of Canada now requires mandatory 14-day self-isolation for everyone entering Canada even if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms. Yukoners flying into Canada with symptoms must quarantine at their arrival destination. Yukoners flying into Canada who do not have symptoms may travel home to the territory where they must then follow Yukon requirements and self-isolate for 14 days. Dental services The Chief Medical Officer of Health is from today ordering the territory’s dental practices to suspend all non-urgent treatment until further notice. This is to protect Yukoners as well as dental care providers from the spread of infection. Patients with queries should contact their dental clinic. Mining industry guidance  Everyone arriving in Yukon must self-isolate for 14 days, including workers at placer or hard rock mines, exploration camps or conducting any other business or duty associated with the mining and exploration industry. Workers cannot carry out their regular duties in a camp or at a mine while they’re self-isolating. Further guidance for the mining industry is on Yukon.ca.

This does not indicate a significant change in circumstances or an increased risk to Yukoners but prepares the government to take rapid action if needed. Declaring a state of emergency will make deploying resources to protect Yukoners and limit the spread of COVID-19 more efficient. This move is in line with many provinces and territories across Canada. Cooperation with all public health measures is critical to the response to COVID-19. Limiting the spread of COVID-19 by closely observing all self-isolation orders is essential to keep this disease from spreading in the territory. The most up to date information on COVID-19 in Yukon can be found at yukon.ca/covid-19.            This action should not alarm Yukoners, it is to prepare a government to respond quickly to their needs.

Yukoners, you must follow the direction of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to protect our territory from the further spread of this virus.      Premier Sandy Silver             Quick facts       The Civil Emergency Measures Act gives the Government of Yukon the ability to act in a fluid and uncertain emergency.  A declaration under the Civil Emergency Measures Act lasts for 90 days but may be terminated before then.          Backgrounder   The Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA), when invoked, provides for a very wide-range of potential solutions in an emergency by Ministerial Order, or by regulation, made under its authority.  In Yukon, non-routine Ministerial Orders are traditionally signed only after Cabinet has reached consensus that it wishes the empowered Minister to do so. The CEMA can be invoked by Cabinet if it is of the opinion that a disaster, real or apprehended, resulting from epidemic whereby injury or loss is or may be caused to persons or property in Yukon. The CEMA is deliberately structured to provide the power to act in a fluid and uncertain emergency. Essentially, the government would be empowered (primarily through the Minister of Community Services) to “do all things considered advisable for the purpose of dealing with the emergency”, including but not limited to: 		protect people and property; maintain, clear and control the use of roads and streets; requisition or otherwise obtain and distribute accommodation, food, clothing and other services; provide and maintain water supplies, electrical power and sewage disposal; assist in the enforcement of law; fight and prevent fires; protect the health, safety and welfare of local inhabitants; and, put into effect any civil emergency plans.  Orders or regulations under the CEMA can override all other YG Acts except those with a special paramountcy clause including the Financial Administration Act, the Human Rights Act, and the Health Information and Privacy Management Act.   A declaration under CEMA is for 90 days but may be terminated before then or continued as needed. CEMA allows for municipalities to also declare states of emergencies, either during or outside of a Government of Yukon emergency.  When a state of emergency is in place, there are specified limits of liability in respect to actions taken or not taken in an emergency. Specifically persons operating under the authority of the Act are not liable for damage caused by interference with the rights of others and cannot be subjected to legal proceedings because of actions taken or not taken in respect to the emergency.

This decision is in response to concerns related to COVID-19 and travel restrictions across the country. The feasibility of the special guide licence lottery will be reassessed in late May.

The Advanced Artist Award is increased by $75,000. This one-time increase makes $150,000 available at the April 1, 2020 intake to support artists to enhance their artistic professional development. The increased funding will not affect the October intake, which will still have the standard $75,000 available. The Arts Fund is increased by $125,000 and the Government of Yukon will be offering a one-time special intake in April for that amount. The special intake criteria will suspend the current threshold and allow applicants to apply for 100 per cent of eligible project expenses. The regular June, September and December intakes for the Arts Fund have not changed. In addition, the department of Tourism and Culture’s longstanding On Yukon Time funding program will have a special focus for the 2020–21 fiscal year. This $75,000 fund will invite applications for artistic initiatives that can be presented without people gathering; are formed as a reaction or contemplation of COVID-19 and its impacts; demonstrate community innovation; and/or celebrate community kindness and support. Awards of up to $2,500 will be available for individuals and $5,000 for businesses, not-for-profit organizations or collectives for arts-related initiatives.              Yukon’s arts and culture sectors are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic given the loss of income from closures of venues and cancellation of shows and events. These funding program increases and modifications are a practical and immediate way to provide financial support to artists at this time of lost revenue. I am confident that these measures will spark ingenuity and imaginative new ways to engage and create; providing hope, inspiration and an understanding of our society in these challenging times.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys            Quick facts       Advanced Artist Award - April 1, 2020 intake is now $150,000.

The fund is currently available to market and trade-ready tourism businesses (businesses that understand how to administer sales policies direct to consumers and through third party distribution channels), municipalities, destination marketing organizations and First Nations governments featuring tourism experiences.  The funding framework typically uses a 50/50 cost share program, meaning that applicants must contribute 50 per cent of the costs of the project or activity. To assist businesses in this difficult time, the requirement for applicants to contribute 50 per cent has been dropped as a one-time measure for the 2020–21 fiscal year.  The broadened scope of eligible projects and activities will enable businesses to also promote their services and experiences in Yukon. Previously, the fund focused on supporting businesses to promote themselves to visitors who had not yet arrived in the territory.  The TCMF funds approximately 200 projects and activities each year.

These regulations prevent evictions over the next 90 days for residential tenants who are self-isolating or unable to pay their rent on time due to COVID-19. The regulations will also allow tenants to pay their rent late if they are unable to pay it when it is due. This is to support individuals who have lost their jobs, are experiencing a reduction in income or because they are under a health protection measure. Landlords are not be able to evict if the tenant or a member of their household is subject to a health protection measure.            These are uncertain times. The Chief Medical Officer of Health has advised that home is the safest place for Yukoners during the COVID-19 pandemic. These regulations protect Yukon tenants who need to stay home or who have lost their income. We are also committed to supporting landlords; we recognize they are being impacted. Now that these regulations are in place, we will reach out to work with them immediately      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       A tenant who has lost their job or had their income reduced as a result of COVID-19, will be able to end the tenancy early without penalty. This would free up the rental unit to tenants who are able to cover rent.  The tenant will have to pay the unpaid rent as soon as they are able to pay or after the 90 days, whichever comes first.   Landlords will be able to apply to the Residential Tenancies Office for exemption if their property or the safety of others is threatened by the tenant.  A landlord will not be able to enter a rental unit if the residents are under a health protection measure, except for reasons of safety.  Other jurisdictions have introduced similar legislation.

As of April 1, the Government of Yukon will provide ongoing funding for continuous glucose monitoring to all Yukoners with Type 1 Diabetes from age 2 to 18. The decision to provide permanent funding follows an evaluation of a 2018 pilot program for Yukoners with Type 1 Diabetes up to age 25. The pilot provided participants with access to funded continuous glucose monitors (CGM) for a period of two years. Pilot participants reported the program helped them better manage their conditions, improve their quality of life and reduce their financial burden. Yukoners aged 19 to 25 who were part of the pilot program will continue to receive funding for continuous glucose monitoring until a program is available for adults. A program for Yukoners with Type 1 Diabetes over age 18 is currently being developed.            We recognize the challenges that Yukoners with Type 1 Diabetes and their families face on a daily basis. The pilot program helped us understand how we can best support these families to live happy, healthy lives.

COVID-19 cases and test results As of today, March 25, at 10 a.m. there are three cases of COVID-19 in Yukon. This third case is related to travel outside of Yukon. The individual was tested on Monday, March 23 and test results were received this morning. The individual is doing well at home and contact tracing has begun. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many test have been negative, how many results are pending and the total number of tests. Services for hospital outpatients Yukon hospitals are suspending all non-urgent or routine services from Thursday, March 26. This includes bloodwork and lab tests, x-rays, CT scans and other imaging services, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, and specialist appointments. Yukoners should not go to a hospital for a non-urgent service, treatment or exam at this time. The hospitals continue to provide urgent emergency care. These measures are being taken to help the hospitals make sure they have enough staff and resources to respond to the pandemic and ensure only those who need to be in hospital are in a hospital. These steps also support their efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 – and practice physical distancing from each other. Health care insurance  Clarification: Temporary absences have been extended to allow clients until June 30, 2020 to sign in with Insured Health and Hearing Services. People registering for the first time will be able to register by phone but will still have to fulfill a waiting period before being eligible for Yukon Health Care Insurance. Respiratory assessment centre The respiratory assessment centre in Whitehorse is now open to support people with acute respiratory illness such as influenza or COVID-19 who need medical assessment. Yukoners will be referred to the centre from 811, a family physician’s office, Yukon Communicable Disease Control or a hospital emergency department. Self-isolation  Yukoners and any visitors are reminded they must self-isolate for 14 days as soon as they arrive in Yukon if they have travelled within Canada or internationally. People must not stop to get groceries or make visits but go straight home and then arrange the support they need. Yukoners should also self-isolate if they have been identified as a close contact of someone diagnosed with COVID-19. Self-isolation means staying at home for 14 days, monitoring for symptoms and avoiding close contact with other people when going outside for fresh air. The term “quarantine” is not used in Yukon, as it is used by the Public Health Agency of Canada to mean a mandatory restriction of movement in a location determined by that agency. Yukon.ca Yukon.ca continues to be the central place to find information about the territory’s response to COVID-19 and is regularly updated to provide support for Yukoners.

The two cases were confirmed Sunday morning. The two Whitehorse residents are from the same household. They returned from the United States last week and went into self-isolation. When symptoms presented, they contacted Yukon Communicable Disease for testing. They have mild illness and are continuing to self-isolate at home. Yukon’s CMOH said this does not change the level of risk to Yukoners and these first cases demonstrate that the systems that have been put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 work. The individuals closely followed the advice of the CMOH. The couple self-isolated, they contacted the appropriate health authorities for testing, have continued to self-isolate, and their test results were back within three days. Cooperation with all public health measures is critical to the response to COVID-19. Limiting the spread of COVID-19 by closely observing all self-isolation orders is essential to keep this disease from spreading in our territory. The most up-to-date information can be found at yukon.ca/covid-19.            The fact that we have confirmed these cases in Yukon shows our system to test for and detect cases is working.

Bill No. 9 would ban the practice of conversion therapy on minors or adults that have a court appointed guardian or substitute decision-maker and also clarify that conversion therapy is not an insured service. It would also introduce penalties for practicing conversion therapy in Yukon. The Government of Yukon has been conducting broad public engagement to increase inclusiveness for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, plus (LGBTQ2S+) Yukoners in government legislation, policies, programs and services. Throughout the public engagement, Yukoners made it clear that banning conversion therapy is a top priority. The proposed ban is one of the items in the government’s LGBTQ2S+ Action Plan, currently being developed based on engagement with Yukon’s LGBTQ2S+ community.            It is vital that we ensure our territory is inclusive and free of discrimination. Yukoners have called for conversion therapy to be banned in our territory and our government is listening and taking action to prevent this harmful practice from ever happening in the territory. This is not only about protecting Yukoners today, but also protecting the generations to follow us.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie Dendys            Quick facts       Conversion therapy qualifies as practices, treatments or services that are provided with the intent of changing a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.  Conversion therapy does not include a range of legitimate medical and psychological practices around coping, social support, identity exploration and development, or gender-affirming surgery and related treatments.  A guardian or substitute decision-maker is someone who has been appointed to manage an adult’s personal affairs.  The Government of Canada tabled legislation on March 8, 2020 to amend the Criminal Code in order to ban and criminalize conversion therapy.  There are no documented cases of conversion therapy being practiced in Yukon.

Prior to making this decision I took into account the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) and my attendance at the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) annual conference earlier this month. 	The risk for COVID-19 in Yukon and Canada remains low and Yukon’s medical system is well prepared for this situation. 	In making this decision, the CMOH and I considered what might happen if I needed to self-isolate outside of the Yukon and the impacts that would have. At this time, I feel my efforts are needed here at home. 	Obviously, this is an extremely rare situation and this is a precautionary measure. We see great value in these meetings and merit in attending. Today I spoke directly with the Prime Minister and am confident Yukon priorities will be shared at the meeting. 	Also out of an abundance of caution following today’s announcement about the case at PDAC, Minister Pillai is being tested for COVID-19 and will self-isolate until the results are clear. I understand that the Public Service Commission is also reaching out to employees who attended this event to share relevant information. 	Yukoners, I urge you to remain calm and to follow the advice of credible medical professionals. Yukon’s CMOH has been providing updates on the virus and is sharing these through local media and the Yukon.ca website as well as the CMOH site. 	The most clear and constant advice about this virus is to remain vigilant. Wash your hands, cover your mouth if you cough, disinfect objects you touch frequently, avoid close contact with people who are sick and stay home if you are not feeling well. 	If you are presenting with symptoms, contact a health provider through 811.

Bill No. 8 proposes to reduce the small business tax rate from two per cent to zero. The rate change is expected to save Yukon businesses approximately $2 million per year.  The Bill also expands the eligibility for the Business Investment Tax Credit to encourage additional investment in Yukon businesses. Proposed income tax changes would result in Yukoners saving roughly $2.4 million in taxes per year – up to $9.6 million total – by 2023. The changes are geared towards low and middle-income earners and would align with recent adjustments made by the Government of Canada. Bill No. 8 would also modernize and simplify the Insurance Premium Tax Act to bring rates in line with the rest of Canada.            Our government is working hard to make life more affordable for Yukoners. This Bill delivers on two significant commitments we made to Yukon businesses and puts more money in the pockets of those who need it most. Cutting taxes and supporting investment in local businesses will encourage a stronger private sector and generate new economic opportunities in our territory.

This leave would be available to victims of domestic violence perpetrated by intimate partners or family members and to victims of sexualized violence. The proposed leave provisions would also apply to employees if their child or person they care for is a victim of domestic or sexualized violence.            Domestic and sexualized violence is a tragic reality that we know is under-reported and can be experienced by anyone. These leave provisions provide the time, flexibility and economic security for victims to get the support they choose. This is part of our government’s efforts to help those who have experienced violence and sexualized assault. Safe and supported employees make for healthier workplaces in our communities.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Offering paid and unpaid leave for victims of domestic and sexualized violence would remove a large barrier for victims of sexualized and domestic violence. This represents one more step we are taking to support victims and employees in our territory.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie Dendys            Quick facts       All ten provinces and the Northwest Territories have enacted some version of leave for domestic violence. Yukon would join the six jurisdictions that also provide leave for sexualized violence. 	The approaches vary in length of leave provided, and whether it is paid or unpaid.  Rates of domestic violence in Yukon are three times the national average. Rates of sexualized violence in Yukon is also higher than the national average.

Today the Arctic Winter Games Host Society, with the support of the Yukon government and the City of Whitehorse, announced that the Whitehorse 2020 Arctic Winter Games have been cancelled following a recommendation from Yukon’s acting Chief Medical Officer of Health. Cancelling the 2020 Arctic Winter Games was determined to be the most responsible precautionary measure to address concerns around the spread of COVID-19 and is supported by the Arctic Winter Games International Committee. Yukon’s medical system has been and remains well prepared to manage suspected cases of COVID-19 that may arise in Yukon. While there are no cases of COVID-19 in Yukon and the risks low, other regions are experiencing unexpected community spread of the virus. With up to 2000 visitors anticipated to arrive in Whitehorse for the Arctic Winter Games, necessary steps must be taken to ensure the health and safety of Yukoners and visitors to the territory. The organizers and co-hosts are disappointed to have to make this unfortunate decision and express deep gratitude to all those involved in preparing for the Whitehorse 2020 Arctic Winter Games.            The decision to cancel the Whitehorse 2020 Arctic Winter Games was not made easily but while we are disappointed, we are acting responsibly by following the recommendation of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. We will be meeting with the Host Society’s Board of Management, our funding partners and stakeholders over the coming days to build a plan for decommissioning the Games.      2020 AWG Host Society President George Arcand            It is out of an abundance of caution that today, as the Chief Medical Officer of Health, responsible for public health in the Yukon, I have recommended the cancellation of the 2020 Arctic Winter Games that were scheduled to be held here in Whitehorse beginning next week. I am making this recommendation out of concern for the health and safety of Yukoners, of all athletes, staff, volunteers and families, and for their home communities throughout the circumpolar North. COVID-19 is a contagious disease that spreads from person to person rapidly through respiratory secretions. In a setting like the Arctic Winter Games, even a suspected case would be devastating. It is with a heavy heart that I have had to make this recommendation. It is the responsible recommendation, and it is very unfortunate.      Yukon acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Catherine Elliott            Our government supports following the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s recommendation. We believe this is the most responsible course of action in light of concerns around the spread of COVID-19. This is a precautionary measure that is in the best interests of our athletes, support staff, families, and communities across the circumpolar North. We know how much effort has gone into preparing for these games. We thank all those who have helped to organize and prepare for them.      Premier Sandy Silver            We support the difficult but responsible decision to cancel the Games. Our community really stepped up for this event and I want to thank the nearly 2000 volunteers for their efforts and preparation for these Games.

Victims of sexualized assault now have more services available thanks to this initiative, which offers clients wrap-around emotional, medical and legal support. Key components of SART include a 24-hour, confidential, toll-free, Yukon-wide support line for all victims of sexualized assault; victim support workers available for after-hours support on weekends; and a roster of on-call physicians specially trained to support victims of sexualized assault. With SART, the choice of how to deal with a sexualized assault is up to the individual. There is no pressure to contact the police or do anything the individual is uncomfortable with. SART provides the services the individual asks for, even if that just means talking to someone and receiving emotional support. With core components of the SART program in place, ongoing training and collaboration of SART agencies will continue to ensure the full network of services is responsive to the needs of victims. Work is also underway to better integrate SART services into communities in a way that meets their unique needs. Hospital services are currently available in Dawson City and Watson Lake.            Given the high rates of sexualized violence against women and girls, particularly Indigenous women and girls, in Yukon, the Sexualized Assault Response Team has been a long time coming. I am proud of the dedication and effort that went into the implementation of SART. We are not done. We know we need to strengthen partnerships with First Nations governments to make sure culturally relevant and informal support options are available to victims of sexualized violence. I’m looking forward to continuing this work.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie Dendys            The goal of the Sexualized Assault Response Team is to provide the services victims need, when they need them so that they feel believed and supported. SART is designed to meet victims where they are and will support all victims of sexualized assault, inclusive of all genders.      Minister of Justice Tracy-Anne McPhee            As women, mothers, sisters and aunties, we understand the importance of this support team. We know that medical and mental health supports for victims are critical in terms of addressing needs. I am confident that the work that has gone into the SART initiative will provide the strongest support possible when victims of sexualized assaults need it the most.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            The unfortunate prevalence of sexualized assault makes SART an especially timely and vital support network for victims. Yukon Hospitals’ staff and physicians are committed to providing safe, sensitive, victim-focused medical care as a key part of this network, and we’ll continue working closely with system partners to strengthen and expand this important program.      Yukon Hospital Corporation Chair Brian Gillen            We are pleased to see the culmination of over a decade of work by front line agencies for the creation of a Sexualized Assault Response Team. The creation of this team will allow organizations and agencies to work together increasing capacity and support for people who have experienced sexualized violence. Every day, we are confronted by the barriers to accessing support services for people experiencing violence. We are hopeful that the SART will deepen the accessibility, reliability and depth of supports available to survivors empowering them to make informed decisions in their journey.      Women’s Transition Home Executive Director Barbara McInerney            Quick facts       Yukon has one of the highest rates of sexualized violence in the country and many cases are not reported. Several populations experience disproportionately high rates of sexualized violence, including women and girls between 15 and 25 years old, Indigenous people and LGBTQ2S+ folks.  The Sexualized Assault Response Team provides integrated services from different agencies. Supports include help with navigating processes, hospital services, reporting to RCMP, the support line and mental health services.  As a result of the Sexualized Assault Response Team, victims of sexualized violence in Whitehorse and rural communities have priority access to mental wellness care through Mental Wellness and Substance Use hubs.  With SART, you can phone 1-844-967-7275 anywhere in the territory, to talk to a trained professional confidentially and anonymously about your options and to get support.

With a $4.1 million surplus, the 2020–21 Budget includes major funding for community infrastructure, housing, health and education. Building a prosperous Yukon continues to be a priority with a cut to the small business tax rate from two per cent to zero as well as an expansion of the Business Investment Tax Credit to better support Yukon businesses. Cutting the small business tax rate would save Yukon businesses $2 million per year. Proposed changes to the Yukon Basic Personal Amount under the Income Tax Act geared towards low and middle-income earners will also result in Yukoners saving around $2.4 million in taxes per year – up to $9.6 million total – by 2023. Investments in community recreation facilities throughout the territory will support healthy, active living for Yukoners. Highlights include money for the completion of the new Carmacks arena, upgrades to the arena in Mayo, new pools in Pelly Crossing and Ross River, and completion of the state-of-the-art track and field facilities at F.H. Collins Secondary School. Education highlights include funding to complete construction of the new French first language high school as well as planning for new schools in Whistle Bend and Burwash Landing. Major investments in Yukon’s health care system will support implementation of 1Health, a modern, integrated health information system for Yukon’s hospitals and health facilities. Permanent funding for Yukon’s new expanded orthopedic surgery program is also included in the budget to improve access to care for Yukoners and reduce the need for medical travel. Significant investments across Yukon’s housing spectrum include funding for a major mixed-use housing project in downtown Whitehorse as well as multi-unit housing projects in Old Crow and Carcross. Approximately $27 million is included to develop residential lots in Yukon communities, including Whitehorse. An additional $30 million is allotted for retrofits to help Yukoners and Yukon businesses make their homes and facilities more energy efficient. A Five-Year Capital Plan along with the Fiscal and Economic Outlook for Yukon accompany the 2020–21 Budget. The Capital Plan supports First Nations, municipalities, and the private sector to coordinate and plan to meet the needs of Yukoners in all communities. The Fiscal and Economic Outlook shows a territory experiencing the benefits of a strong, growing and diversified economy.            Our government has been working hard to put Yukon’s finances on a sustainable path and create an environment for Yukon’s people and economy to thrive. Returning to a surplus reflects our commitment to sound fiscal management and making responsible financial decisions for the benefit of all Yukoners. This budget builds on our recent progress and once again puts Yukoners first.       Premier and Minister of Finance Sandy Silver            Quick facts       Yukon’s total budget for 2020–21 is $1.62 billion. Operating and maintenance expenses will be $1.25 billion. Capital spending is almost $370 million.  The 2020–21 Main Estimates show an annual surplus of approximately $4.1 million.  The Government of Yukon will also table an Interim Supply Bill worth $338 million. The Bill will fund operations and maintenance spending for the first two months of the 2020–21 fiscal year while the full year of spending authority is debated in the legislature. Of that amount, $271 million is for operations and maintenance spending and $67 million is for capital expenditures.   The Government of Yukon will also table a Second Supplementary Estimates for the 2019–20 fiscal year with an additional $19 million in spending and a revised deficit of $18.5 million.

Following a motion brought forward in May 2017 by MLA Paolo Gallina, the government undertook public engagement on the possibility. After Yukoners adjust their clocks on March 8, the territory will remain on Pacific Daylight Saving Time. The recent seasonal time change survey drew more than 4,800 responses from Yukon people and organizations, with most in favour of putting an end to the practice. The What We Heard report released today shows that 93 per cent of Yukoners who participated want seasonal time changes to stop. Of those, 70 per cent are in favour of permanent Pacific Daylight Saving Time.            Yukoners clearly want to see an end to seasonal time change and we are listening. The response to this engagement speaks to the importance of this issue for people. Thank you to everyone who took the time to voice an opinion. This helped our government make an informed decision for Yukon.      Premier Sandy Silver            Quick facts       The spring 2020 seasonal time change will go ahead as planned this Sunday, March 8. After that, Yukon will remain on Pacific Daylight Saving Time.  The engagement ran from January 6 to February 16 of this year. Among other things, Yukoners were asked whether they want to keep the twice-annual time change or permanently adopt a single time.  More than 4,800 organizations and individuals responded to the online survey. That’s 1,500 more than 2017’s engagement on cannabis, which was previously the highest. The government also received over 35 written and emailed submissions from a broad group of organizations and individuals from across the territory.

650,2020-03-04,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukoners-benefit-improved-renal-support-and-care,Government Website,Yukoners to benefit from improved renal support and care,"           Published 04/03/2020        The Government of Yukon has signed a letter of intent with the BC Renal Agency to maximize opportunities for Yukoners to receive dialysis in Yukon. This new partnership will increase focus on early intervention and support of independent dialysis options. A primary goal will be to work with patients early in their kidney disease process to help maintain kidney function without requiring dialysis. Yukoners identified as candidates for peritoneal or home dialysis will be supported to receive training in B.C., and provided with the home equipment, and where necessary, home supports to ensure a positive outcome. A review by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health recommends independent, home-based dialysis as the preferred first option for patients requiring dialysis. Home-based dialysis is just as effective as hemodialysis provided in a hospital setting. This release has been updated to clarify medical terminology.            We are committed to providing Yukoners with access to the care they need, where they need it. I am very pleased to announce that with the support of BC Renal Agency, Yukoners with Chronic Kidney Disease will now receive increased support here at home.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            BC’s Kidney care community is proud and privileged to continue to be able to support those living in the Yukon with kidney disease. This new initiative will formalize the range of services across the continuum to improve outcomes and ensure the sustainability of the best kidney care for people in the territory.      BC Renal executive director Dr. Adeera Levin            Quick facts       There are approximately 61 individuals in Yukon with diagnosed chronic kidney disease. None of them currently require dialysis.  As of October 2019, there were 10 Yukon patients on peritoneal dialysis in Yukon. There were none on home hemodialysis. That number has fluctuated between zero and two for the past six years; the peritoneal numbers have fluctuated between four and 10. 	   The Government of Yukon and BC Renal Agency are setting the framework to improve services and better support patients with kidney disease in territory. This is a first in the 30-year history of renal care delivery in the territory.   This framework includes exploring early intervention, prevention and localized navigational support to help prevent progression early. These are fundamental first steps to building capacity and sustainability of renal services and optimizing outcomes for Yukoners.  It is estimated it would cost between $2.5 and $3 million to establish an in-centre hemodialysis unit. Establishing a home dialysis program will cost less than $1 million and would permit the care of a larger number of individuals. As part of the agreement, government is working with B.C.

The event includes a zero-emission car and trade show with local dealerships and local owners putting their electric vehicles on display. The Yukon Transportation Museum is also unveiling two new exhibits on the history and the future of electric vehicles in the North. The public can interact with zero-emission vehicles and speak to local owners about tips and tricks of owning and operating an electric vehicle in Yukon.            The Government of Canada is committed to getting more zero-emission vehicles on our roads, which is a practical and effective way for Canadians to do their part to fight pollution and create a more sustainable future. We are pleased to collaborate with the Government of Yukon to ensure Canadians can make informed decisions when choosing their next vehicle.      Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources Seamus O’Regan             We are proud to support the Government of Yukon’s effort to raise awareness of zero emission vehicles and their use in northern climates. Investments such as these will help Yukoners make greener choices — improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and bringing us closer to a zero-emission future.      Member of Parliament for Yukon, Larry Bagnell            The interest in electric vehicles is high in Yukon. The Government of Yukon aims to increase the use of electric vehicles, as it significantly reduces our greenhouse gas emissions. This event will raise awareness and offer practical ways of learning about how electric vehicles perform in our cold climate.      Minister of Department Energy Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            At the Yukon Transportation Museum we share the compelling stories behind Yukon transportation: planes, trains, trucks, dogs, horses, people. The underlying infrastructure and energy networks are complex, dynamic and equally engaging. How have Yukoners met their needs for transportation and energy in changing circumstances, technologies, seasons since time immemorial? The answer is, exactly as we are doing now, with thoughtfulness, ingenuity and self-sufficiency.      Executive Director of Yukon Transportation Museum Janna Swales            Quick facts       The Government of Canada’s Zero-Emission Vehicle Awareness Initiative is providing $48,500 to raise awareness about zero-emission vehicles in Yukon, including by supporting the Electric Vehicle Discovery Day. The Government of Yukon is investing $41,500 and the Yukon Transportation Museum is contributing $4,500 to this project.  There will be at least six zero-emission electric vehicles participating in the event.  According to Yukon Bureau of Statistics, there are currently 16 electric vehicles registered in Yukon.  Our Clean Future, Yukon’s draft strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy, proposes to have more than 6,000 zero-emission vehicles registered in the territory by 2030; provide a rebate to Yukon businesses and individuals who purchase eligible zero-emissions vehicles; and continue to install fast-charging stations across Yukon to make it possible to travel between all road-accessible Yukon communities by 2027.

The plan will see two tenants move in each week until the building is full. The 16-unit building is the first Housing First project in the territory and signifies the Government of Yukon’s commitment to addressing homelessness and poverty in Yukon. Housing First is a modern, progressive approach to addressing poverty that centres on providing immediate access to permanent homes with no ‘readiness’ requirements, such as needing citizens to be alcohol- or drug-free. It is recovery-oriented and focused on consumer choice, self-determination and community integration. The goal is to encourage housing stability and improved quality of life and foster self-sufficiency. It is a key part of the housing continuum in Whitehorse and provides an additional option for some of the most vulnerable homeless citizens in Yukon. The total project cost was $4.4 million, which included design, site and utilities preparation, and construction. Several non-government agencies provide outreach and ongoing client support services. This work will continue with shelter residents.            Knowing that people are moving into their new homes, and hearing they feel safe and secure lets me know that we have done the right thing to support those who are most in need. This is a critical part of the housing continuum, and I am pleased that our government is taking active steps towards addressing the housing and support needs of some of the most vulnerable members of our community.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Resident selection was done through the Coordinated Access partners using the By Name List and other sources to ensure that people who most need this type of housing can access it.

661,2020-02-28,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/second-wave-seasonal-flu-hits-yukon,Government Website,Second wave of seasonal flu hits Yukon,"           Published 28/02/2020        Yukon is seeing increasing numbers of influenza, with 75 cases confirmed in Yukon so far this flu season. In the last five weeks alone, 43 cases of influenza have been confirmed. In addition to the increase in influenza activity, there is also an increase in respiratory illness caused by other viruses. Yukoners are encouraged to receive their immunization against the seasonal flu, especially those with chronic medical conditions, as well as those over 65, pregnant women, and young children. The vaccine is free and available to everyone over the age of six months through local health centres in the communities and the Whitehorse Health centre. For more information on flu clinic location and times: https://yukonimmunization.ca/diseases-vaccines/influenza. If you think you have influenza and you are at high risk of severe influenza, seek early care from your health care provider. Seek medical care if you become very sick or are worried about your illness.            Influenza hit early, then waned and we are now seeing a second wave, with an increase in the number of confirmed cases in the past five weeks. The most effective way for Yukoners to protect themselves is to receive their seasonal influenza immunization. The vast majority of the cases of confirmed influenza in the territory are in those individuals who have not received their immunization.      Yukon’s Acting Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Catherine Elliott            Quick facts       The following everyday practices help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including influenza: wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available; avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands; avoid close contact with people who are sick; clean and disinfect objects and surfaces that are touched a lot; cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue immediately into the trash; or cover your mouth and nose with your inner elbow when you cough or sneeze; and, stay home when you are sick to avoid spreading the virus to others.  Influenza can cause serious illness and hospitalization among those with chronic conditions.  Symptoms of influenza include rapid onset of high fever, cough, sore throat, aches, pains and chills.  Rest and treatment of symptoms are usually all that is needed. People who suspect they have the flu should avoid spreading it by staying home until they feel better.  People with severe symptoms, or who get the flu on top of underlying health conditions, should get medical advice by either calling the Yukon HealthLine at 811 or consulting with their health care provider.  The vaccine is safe and it takes about two weeks for the influenza vaccine to become effective.

Cultural practices, such as sweat ceremonies and drumming circles, have been incorporated into the correctional centre’s regular operations, along with cultural awareness training for staff, the hiring of a full-time First Nation liaison and a contribution of 30 books with First Nations content to the facility’s library. These projects support the Government of Yukon’s commitment to address 40 recommendations made by legal advisor David Loukidelis, following his independent inspection of the WCC, which began in January 2018. The report, released publicly August 15, 2018, made recommendations for cultural programming to improve outcomes for First Nations individuals in Yukon’s justice system. The outdoor sweat lodge was constructed at WCC in the fall, with the first sweat ceremony taking place in October 2019.            We have known for a long time that access to cultural activities, and the outdoors, is vital to inmates’ mental well-being and future successes. I am so pleased that we have been able to partner with First Nations to support inmates on this truly important project.      Minister of Justice Tracy-Anne McPhee            CYFN is committed to the task of improving the lives of all Yukon First Nations by facilitating a re-connection with culture.

The Dynamic Speed Display Sign Program will see mobile radar speed signs alongside targeted RCMP enforcement at 10 high-infraction locations in Whitehorse. The signs and RCMP enforcement will be established for up to four weeks per location. Radar signs are a proven road safety countermeasure and have been shown to have a significant impact on increasing compliance with posted speed limits.            Reckless drivers needlessly endanger the vast majority of citizens who follow the rules of the road. We are proud to partner with the City of Whitehorse and RCMP in this effort to reduce dangerous driving.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            We have heard from residents and understand that the safety of our roadways is a top issue.

The in-territory orthopedic program brings specialized care closer to home, improving access and continuity of care for patients, and reducing travel time and costs for families. It also reduces pressures on medical travel as well as demands on visiting specialists. With two surgeons, the program now provides emergency and on-call services and is better able to manage wait times for total knee replacements. Dr. Scott Westberg, who specializes in lower leg extremities, has joined Dr. Curtis Myden at the Surgeon’s Clinic at Whitehorse General Hospital. Dr. Westberg is originally from Yukon, and was a recipient of the Yukon Medical Education Bursary.  The name of the bursary has been corrected and updated.            We are excited to welcome Dr. Westberg to the orthopedics program at the Whitehorse General Hospital. Since we introduced the first resident orthopedic surgeon in 2017, more Yukoners have been getting the care they need, closer to home. We’ve reduced the number of Yukoners waiting for consultations and surgeries, and the addition of Dr. Westberg will help us continue this important work.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Expanding the orthopedic program means more Yukoners get the surgery they need, when they need it. Now, even more patients can prepare for, have, and recover from these important operations right here in Yukon. We are proud to partner with physicians and the Government of Yukon and confident this expansion will help us transform orthopedic care for years to come.      Chair of Yukon Hospital Corporation Brian Gillen            It’s exciting to have Dr. Westberg join me. He brings expertise in foot, ankle and knee replacement and trauma surgery. We plan to continue to improve and advance orthopedic care for Yukoners.      Dr. Curtis Myden             Quick facts       Orthopedic surgeons work with patients who have disorders of the bones, joints, ligaments, tendons and muscles.

We are excited to be hosting education leaders from across the country here in Whitehorse. This summit is a great opportunity to share stories about the collaboration underway with Yukon First Nations in Yukon schools to support student learning and outcomes for all students, including examples of how Yukon First Nations ways of knowing, doing and being are included in Yukon’s curriculum and school programs.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            We are honoured to be co-hosting the C21 CEO Academy Winter meetings with the Yukon Department of Education in Whitehorse. The Shifting Minds Acknowledgement is a token of our appreciation in recognition of our partnership, and leadership and innovative spirit demonstrated by the Yukon Department of Education.

The Government of Yukon’s Community Development Fund provided funding to the Whitehorse Firefighters Charitable Society to purchase the textile baler to help recycle clothing and divert it from Yukon’s landfills. The baler has been installed on location at Raven Recycling and will be operated and maintained by Raven Recycling staff. As a part of this initiative, recycling depots outside of Whitehorse are also accepting textiles. The Government of Yukon is transporting fabrics from rural depots back to Whitehorse, where Raven Recycling will process and ship them south for recycling.            We are proud to support this initiative through the Community Development Fund. This project is set to make an impact on waste diversion and the amount of textiles in our landfills. Thank you to the Whitehorse Firefighters Charitable Society and Raven Recycling for partnering on this exciting project.      Minister of Economic Development Ranj Pillai            Finding a way to repurpose and reuse clothing is always the best option, and we know Yukoners are great at coming up with creative solutions to reduce waste. It is also necessary, that as a territory, we have a viable option for recycling textiles. Thank you to Raven Recycling and the Whitehorse Firefighters Charitable Society, for expanding and improving recycling in the territory.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            A growing problem of textiles was over burdening local second-hand clothing locations with costs, they were overjoyed when we said we would accept their clothing for free. Monetary value was not high enough to entice private industry to grapple with this growing problem. Our two organizations working together with common mandates to help their community were able to offset the pressure faced by second-hand organizations.      Whitehorse Firefighters Charitable Society Textile Program Director Nick O’Carroll            Recycling is the best option for textiles that can’t be reused or repurposed locally. In 2018, Raven diverted 117,000 lbs of textiles from local landfills. This recycled material displaces virgin material in the textiles economy, reducing the pollution, resource use and energy consumption associated with new products.      Raven Recycling Executive Director Joy Snyder            Quick facts       In June 2017, Raven Recycling and Whitehorse Firefighters Charitable Society created a social enterprise to divert, bale and sell re-usable textiles to a market in British Columbia.  In 2018, City of Whitehorse commissioned a study that estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 pounds of re-usable textiles enter the City of Whitehorse landfill each year.  Reusing or repurposing textiles locally is preferable to recycling. Examples of this include thrifting, clothing swaps or crafting.  To recycle your textiles, make sure they are clean and bagged and drop them off at Raven Recycling or at your local recycling depot. Dirty textiles will not be recycled. Shoes, belts and purses are not accepted for recycling.

Midwives will be employees of the Government of Yukon to ensure Yukoners have access to sustainable and integrated midwifery services. Development of a model of care was informed by extensive research, input from public engagement, the work of the Midwifery Advisory Committee, and a recommendation received from the Canadian Association of Midwives. The first action under the approved model will be to hire a Midwifery Consultant to coordinate the planning and program implementation. The position will be responsible for leading an Implementation Advisory Committee made up of a wide variety of stakeholders.

The Government of Yukon is currently working with the Midwifery Advisory Committee to review draft regulations. The final regulations are expected for 2020 and will come into force with the launch of the midwifery program.            We are very excited to move this initiative forward so that Yukoners can have another safe option that supports healthy pregnancies, childbirth and post-natal care. By working in partnership with all health care providers we are ensuring midwifery is integrated into Yukon’s healthcare system in a safe and sustainable way that provides Yukoners with access to the right care, at the right time and in the right place.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            We are committed to providing regulated and funded midwifery services for Yukon families. Draft regulations and the approved model of care both mark significant milestones. We look forward to working with the Midwifery Advisory Committee, stakeholders and communities as we create a sustainable path forward for midwifery in the Yukon.

The governments will be partnering with the agricultural sector, as well as academic and community leaders, to develop and share expertise specific to growing in northern latitudes. Topics of discussion will include limitations in temperature and duration of seasons, as well as supporting business relationships among different farmers, food processors and agriculture service suppliers in both areas. Targeted goals will include: Expanding local food and beverage production through a farmer/rancher forum that supports networking, knowledge transfer and business relationships.  Developing and sharing expertise around farm management in remote settings. Partnering with academic institutions to help northern growers and food processing sectors grow and commercialize products. Reducing barriers to agricultural trade between neighbouring jurisdictions. Increasing producers’ access to processing and retail markets and shared inspection services; for example, increasing access to meat inspections through shared inspection services or mobile abattoirs. The governments also committed to supporting a larger role for Indigenous peoples in northern agriculture and sustainable food production by working with Indigenous communities to develop business opportunities and traditional-food-based initiatives.

In 2019, there was a record number of inspected slaughters in Yukon. A total of 536 cattle, elk, sheep, goats, swine and rabbits were processed and inspected through abattoirs, and Yukon’s mobile abattoir added stops to two communities, broadening the access to inspected slaughter for farmers outside of Whitehorse. Graded egg production has also increased dramatically since 2016. The Local Food Strategy for Yukon, adopted in 2016, encourages the production and consumption of Yukon-grown food, supports local food producers and strengthens the relationship between Yukoners, Yukon farmers and food.  Since 2018, Yukon has committed over $1.3 million to 173 agriculture projects throughout Yukon in a bilateral agreement with the Government of Canada under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership. These programs provide funding for industry projects that further strengthen Yukon’s local food production. 		  Agriculture in British Columbia B.C. farmers, ranchers, seafood and processing workers contributed to a record-setting year in 2018, with annual revenue from businesses in those sectors reaching $15 billion for the first time. B.C. consumers and companies continue to be the main buyers of B.C. products, with an estimated $6.4 billion of purchases. The Ministry of Agriculture began a new mandate in 2017 to support B.C. farmers through a three-pronged approach: 		​  		Grow B.C., which creates a network of food hubs supporting entrepreneurs and food processors around the province, and has programs to increase production and support new farmers; Feed B.C., which encourages the use of local products in government-operated institutions and facilities; and Buy B.C., which is helping more than 200 local companies promote their products in B.C., as well as developing partnerships supporting local foods in retailers.

690,2020-01-06,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/public-engagement-seasonal-time-change-launches,Government Website,Public engagement on seasonal time change launches,"           Published 06/01/2020        The Government of Yukon is opening a public engagement today on seasonal time change. Yukoners are being asked whether they want to keep the twice-annual time change or permanently adopt a single time. The public engagement also asks Yukoners whether they’d prefer Pacific Daylight Saving Time or Pacific Standard Time if the time change is dropped. Yukon currently observes Pacific Standard Time in the winter months and Pacific Daylight Saving Time in the summer. Yukoners can participate in an online survey, which is also available in print form, or share their views by email or mail. Other governments in Yukon as well as businesses, organizations and individuals are also invited to provide their written feedback by email or mail. Through the engagement, people can let the government know which option would best fit their lifestyle and why. The Government of Yukon will consider the input, as well as scientific research and the decisions of neighbouring jurisdictions, when it determines how Yukon should observe time in the future.            Jurisdictions across Canada and Pacific North America are re-examining the way they observe time and potential changes could impact our territory. We need to make a decision on what time regime works best for Yukon and we want to know what Yukoners think before we make that call.      Premier Sandy Silver            Quick facts       If Yukon permanently adopts Pacific Daylight Saving Time, summer time would be the same as it has for years, sunrises and sunsets would happen one hour later in the winter, and the territory would align with British Columbia when it makes its permanent time change.  If Yukon were to stay on year-round Pacific Standard Time, winter time would be the same as it is now, sunrises and sunsets would happen one hour earlier in the summer, the territory would permanently be behind British Columbia when it makes its permanent time change, and Yukon would be an additional hour away from other Canadian jurisdictions when they are on Daylight Saving Time (e.g., Alberta would be two hours ahead, Ontario would be four hours ahead).  Many jurisdictions in western North America are reviewing how they set and observe time for a number of reasons, including public health, energy, and the economy. Following their own public engagement, the Government of British Columbia introduced legislation in 2019 to get rid of the seasonal time change and adopt a new permanent Pacific Time equivalent to Pacific Daylight Saving Time.

There are now three resident psychiatrists working in the territory, based out of a new private practice in Whitehorse. A new model of care has also been introduced. General psychiatric services are being provided at the private clinic and at Whitehorse General Hospital. Treatment services are offered through Mental Wellness and Substance Use Services and the Referred Care Clinic. This model takes a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to mental healthcare. Over the coming year, the psychiatric group will also develop a plan to provide both in-person and virtual care to rural Yukon communities, as well as ensuring 24/7 on-call hospital coverage.            Improving the mental wellness of Yukoners is a priority of our government because we recognize that healthy minds are just as important as healthy bodies. This is yet another important step toward ensuring that Yukoners have the mental health supports they need, when and where they need them.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Now that we have a critical mass of specialists, it should be easier to attract and keep new psychiatrists in Yukon in the future. We are starting a number of innovative programs aimed at improving access to psychiatric and addictions care in all of our communities. We are also actively recruiting other psychiatrists to help us on a part-time or full-time basis. We are after a long-term, sustainable solution for psychiatric services in the territory. Doctors Jill Boyd, Dorothy Kuk and I are happy to be providing patient-centred care in a supportive environment.      Dr. Leo Elwell, Psychiatrist            Quick facts       All three resident psychiatrists are Canadian-trained, fully qualified Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada.

These preliminary plans ensure schools follow the health and safety guidelines from the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Planning for the 2020–21 school year is an ongoing process. Yukon First Nations, school councils and education partners will continue to be engaged and their feedback incorporated as planning continues for the 2020–21 school year. School principals will share finalized school operational plans with school communities in August before the start of the 2020–21 school year. Rural school operations in the 2020–21 school year Rural schools have the flexibility in their learning spaces to safely bring back all students to the school while following health and safety guidelines. This is why all Kindergarten to Grade 12 students in rural schools return to full-day in-class instruction five days per week. Whitehorse school operations in the 2020–21 school year In Whitehorse, Kindergarten to Grade 9 students in Whitehorse will also return to full-day, in-class instruction five days per week. Grades 10 to 12 students will return to half-day in-class instruction and half-day learning away from school five days per week. This arrangement for Grades 10 to 12 students will be monitored and assessed as part of planning for the second semester of the school year. Resource programs for students with disabilities, transitions programs and other programs for students needing additional support will continue at school all day, five days per week. This approach ensures schools are following the health and safety guidelines from the Chief Medical Officer of Health and ensures all students have time and support from their teachers every day and regular routines for learning. The Department of Education will monitor the situation and advice on the pandemic over the first semester to assess the possibility of safely returning Grades 10 to 12 students to more usual class sizes and schedules in the second semester. Grades 10 to 12 students will continue to take four courses per semester and school staff will work with students and families to assign morning or afternoon classes in their school at the start of the school year. These students will also be able to access supports for learning away from schools through virtual or in-person study halls with teachers. Temporary school programming relocation To meet the health and safety guidelines for schools, support safe spacing, and manage traffic flows in schools, some school programming needs to be temporarily relocated for the 2020–21 school year. To support safe spacing at F.H. Collins Secondary, the Grade 8 classes from F.H. Collins Secondary will be moved to the Wood Street Centre for the 2020–21 school year. The Wood Street Centre programs will move into available space at Porter Creek Secondary for the school year.  No other groups of students or programs are expected to need relocation. Student learning in the 2020–21 school year As part of Yukon’s modernized curriculum, teachers and students will continue to use technology as part of learning to develop digital literacy and skills they will need for their lives and careers. For the 2020–21 school year, educators will continue to build these skills with students through blended learning, which combines: face-to-face teaching and learning, where students apply their knowledge, deepen their understanding and demonstrate their learning with their teachers, including teacher-led activities, on the land learning opportunities, workstations and labs; student-led learning where students use digital tools to gather information through inquiry, reading, research and work on assignments, including online tools, resources, and collaboration; teachers support, instruction and feedback both in person and online; and students learning skills for success to manage some of their own learning, including goal setting, organization, prioritizing and time management, with some flexibility for the time, place and pace of their learning. Students in Kindergarten to Grade 3 will have traditional direct instruction and support from teachers for their learning. Students in Grades 4 to 9 students will have both face-to-face activities with their teachers and classmates and digital activities with technology and online tools. Students in Grades 10 to 12 will learn for the half the day with face-to-face activities with their teachers and classmates in school and learn for the other half of the day away from school with digital activities with technology and online tools. More information about student learning in the coming school year is available in the Yukon Learning Continuity Requirements 2020–21. Student transportation School bus services for the 2020–21 school year are being adapted based on recommendations of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, including fewer students riding the bus to support safe spacing. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and the Department of Education encourage families to arrange for students to walk, cycle, drive or carpool to transport students between home and school this year if possible. Detailed school bus operational guidelines, including number of students per seat, loading and unloading procedures, and cleaning protocols will be released later in July. Further health and safety guidelines and planning details for the coming school year will be shared as they become available over the summer.            The wellbeing of students and staff is our priority. We are working to ensure Yukon schools are safe and healthy environments for returning to class and that all students have face-to-face opportunities to learn with their teachers and classmates while following the health and safety guidance from the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Plans for the 2020–21 school year include flexibility to adjust operations or reduce the number of students in schools if necessary. We continue to work with school communities, School Councils, Yukon First Nations and the Yukon Teachers’ Association on operational planning to meet the unique needs and context of each school community.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            Getting children back into schools is critical for their health and learning success. Keeping children out of school for too long can result in long lasting emotional, and mental health effects. Students rely on teachers, counsellors, support staff and fellow students for formal and informal mental wellbeing and support, while continued closures can expose children to social isolation and boredom. Much work has gone into our efforts between the Department of Education and my team to ensure we have the proper protective measures in place to get children and youth back into a familiar environment and to thrive in a renewed educational environment that also supports and protects teachers and staff.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       Planning for the 2020–21 school year is ongoing. Yukon First Nations, school councils and education partners will continue to be engaged and their feedback incorporated as planning continues for the 2020–21 school year.  The Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon is working with its school community to determine plans for operational plans at École Émilie-Tremblay and Académie Parhélie for the 2020–21 school year.  Finalized school operational plans will be shared with school communities in August before the start of the 2020–21 school year.  Learning time with teachers will focus on applying skills and developing understanding and learning time away from school will focus on independent reading, research and assignments.  Grades 10 to 12 students will be able to access additional support for learning away from school through virtual or in-person study halls with teachers.  Students will be prioritized for busing in the 2020–21 school year if they are eligible for school busing as described in the Education Act and Student Transportation Regulations for students residing outside of a 3.2 kilometres radius of their school and are enrolled in their attendance area school.  Any families who require and are eligible for school bussing and have not yet registered are strongly encouraged to do so as soon as possible. Whitehorse parents and guardians find out about bus registration. Rural parents and guardians should contact the school directly.
