The funding includes:   	• $726,000 for the continued operation of an isolation space on Sargent Avenue provided by Manitoba Housing, for individuals who have or are suspected to have COVID-19;   	• $54,000 for a daytime drop-in program at Main Street Project (MSP) intended to support individuals who want to find more stable housing;   	• $228,114 for 50 overnight shelter beds at MSP;   	• $150,000 to continue to support 50 overnight shelter beds at Siloam Mission; and    	• $360,000 for the ongoing operations of Salvation Army, which continues to experience pandemic-related financial challenges.   	    	The new drop-in program has been developed by MSP based on its experiences with clients earlier in the pandemic response. It is intended to provide more meaningful, supportive conversations with clients to help them move toward more stable housing, addictions treatment or other community-based services.   	    	“In such uncertain times, this funding will allow us to keep beds open in our new Buhler Centre shelter expansion and ensure safe nights for those who have nowhere else to go,” said Jim Bell, CEO, Siloam Mission. “We are so thankful to the Province of Manitoba for this additional investment and for caring for those in need.”   	    	In June, the province announced a $5-million investment in Winnipeg’s Downtown Safety Partnership (DSP), which includes an extension of outreach in the downtown area to 24-7, new community service teams and a 24-7 Downtown Safety Communications Centre. In the coming months, the province will add new accountability measures to all of the homeless shelter Service Purchase Agreements to ensure collaboration with the DSP.   	    	“Our government is committed to making downtown Winnipeg safer and our homeless shelters are a big part of that,” said Stefanson. “Greater collaboration with the Downtown Safety Partnership will help ensure that at-risk people get the supports they need while protecting all Manitobans from crime in the downtown.”   	    	The minister noted today’s investment builds on funding that was announced in April to help homeless shelters respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to today’s announcement, more than $1.9 million has been allocated to MSP, Siloam Mission, Salvation Army, Resource Assistance for Youth and Samaritan House in Brandon to support individuals experiencing homelessness.    	    	For more information on COVID-19 in Manitoba, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.    	    	- 30 -   	   "

However, no broad systemic orders dealing with the responsibility for delivering these services on reserve were made. Manitoba is bringing an application for judicial review of the decision to gain clarity about its obligation to deliver services on reserve.   	    	The province will respect the MHRC decision to award damages to the family in question and provide provincial services during the judicial review process, the minister said.    	    	The minister noted the Constitution of Canada is based on a model of co-operative federalism that relies on federal and provincial governments and First Nations working together to develop and maintain various services.   	    	“The Manitoba government is committed to working collaboratively and will continue to provide services to Manitobans in keeping with the long-standing practices of co-operative federalism,” she said. “However, Canada has assumed responsibility for providing health-care funding for reserves in recognition of its historical relationship with First Nations people, and it’s now time to also own its role to bridge the health gap between those living on reserve and other Canadians.”    	    	- 30 -   	   "

However, no broad systemic orders dealing with the responsibility for delivering these services on reserve were made. Manitoba is bringing an application for judicial review of the decision to gain clarity about its obligation to deliver services on reserve.   	    	The province will respect the MHRC decision to award damages to the family in question and provide provincial services during the judicial review process, the minister said.    	    	The minister noted the Constitution of Canada is based on a model of co-operative federalism that relies on federal and provincial governments and First Nations working together to develop and maintain various services.   	    	“The Manitoba government is committed to working collaboratively and will continue to provide services to Manitobans in keeping with the long-standing practices of co-operative federalism,” she said. “However, Canada has assumed responsibility for providing health-care funding for reserves in recognition of its historical relationship with First Nations people, and it’s now time to also own its role to bridge the health gap between those living on reserve and other Canadians.”    	    	- 30 -   	   "

Each unit will have a visiting room with space for one resident and up to five visitors. Visitors will enter the visiting room from the outside of the personal care home, while an enclosed link will ensure residents have direct access from the personal care home. Electrical and mechanical systems have been designed to ensure each shelter is functional all year round. In keeping with public health guidelines, systems will be in place to provide required air changes and interior finishes will allow easy cleaning.      	    	“After a competitive procurement process and rigorous evaluation, we are very pleased with the results and PCL’s innovative design,” said Helwer. “We are working with PCL as a partner to help Manitobans safely visit loved ones in personal care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic.”   	    	All Canadians were devastated by the over 7,000 COVID-related deaths in long-term care facilities in Quebec and Ontario. Manitobans recently had a reminder of the risks of COVID in PCHs as cases were reported at certain facilities, Friesen said. Manitoba’s PCHs continue to have extensive precautions in place to protect vulnerable residents, including strict visitor restrictions, enhanced screening for staff and the implementation of a one-site staffing model at personal care homes, he added.   	    	“While there was no choice but to close PCHs at the start of the pandemic, every effort is being made to maintain access between residents and loved ones,” said Friesen. “These all-season shelters will ensure these much-needed visits can continue uninterrupted, while keeping PCH residents and visitors safe.”    	    	Helwer noted the outdoor shelters are expected to be operational by November. In addition to the outdoor shelters, work continues to develop indoor visitation rooms at some sites where visitors can easily access the space from outside the personal care home and maintain the same public health requirements as the outdoor shelters.    	    	For more information on COVID-19 in Manitoba, including the most recent changes to the #RestartMB Pandemic Response System, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.    	    	    	- 30 -   	   "

The bridge is a connection to the city of Winnipeg and other areas in Manitoba, and acts as an important trade corridor for goods and services.    	    	On July 12, 2018, the bridge suffered an over-height vehicle collision. Immediately following the incident, Manitoba Infrastructure inspected the bridge and determined the damaged girder and a portion of the deck needed to be removed. Removal of these sections prevented further damage and allowed for re-opening of the Oasis Road under the bridge.   	    	A public information session on the bridge replacement was held last May to inform the public of the design work, with construction to begin this fall. North and southbound bridges will be built to replace the existing structure and roadway realignments will take place. In addition, the bridge replacement will have an increased clearance of 1.5 metres in height to meet new floodway standards. Construction will be staged to accommodate the operation of the Red River Floodway and is anticipated to be completed and fully open to traffic by fall of 2023, the minister added.   	    	“We are excited to be moving ahead with the new PTH 59 bridge.

The province confirmed new start-up companies are eligible, providing they have a business number.   	    	“Extending the program through the calendar year will support seasonal winter businesses and allow existing employers to use the program for a greater length of time into the holiday season,” said Eichler. “Youth employment remains a focus of our government, and we want to give employers the flexibility to rehire summer students, which increases job creation and benefits post-secondary students and businesses alike.”    	    	To date, the Back to Work Manitoba Initiative has received more than 800 applications from employers for 4,500 positions and $22.6 million in supports. Some of the top participating sectors include retail trade (16 per cent), agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (12 per cent), and accommodation and food services (eight per cent).   	    	The premier and minister highlighted the province’s ongoing business outreach throughout the pandemic, such as regular calls with key business stakeholders, including the restaurant and food services industry, to hear their challenges and input to shape provincial response plans.    	    	The Manitoba government has authorized expenditures of $714 million in 2020-21 to support businesses and not-for-profit organizations through supports such as conditional non-repayable loans and working capital, targeted wage subsidies, rent supports, deferred fees and interest, rebates, infrastructure spending as well as non-financial support.   	    	Programs include the $120-million Manitoba Gap Protection Program, which provides a one-time $6,000 non-interest-bearing forgivable loan to eligible Manitoba small and medium-sized businesses; $120 million for the Back to Work This Summer Initiative and Summer Student Recovery Jobs Program; and $350 million for infrastructure construction projects as part of the two-year, $500-million Manitoba Restart Capital Program.   	    	Recent labour force statistics that show nearly 70 per cent of Manitobans who lost their jobs in March and April have been rehired, and Pallister and Eichler confirmed the province’s commitment to get even more employees back to work.   	    	The Back to Work Manitoba Wage Subsidy application deadline is now Dec. 1. Employers will be required to provide proof of payment of wages by Feb. 1, 2021. Program details and the application form are available online at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/restartmb/btwmp.html.   	    	- 30 -   	   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

As residents stay home more, it is important to continue to provide opportunities to recycle paper and packaging, such as beverage containers.    	    	Manitoba is also continuing to support diverting organic waste from landfills, with up to $620,000 in Manitoba Composts Support Payments available to private and public compost facilities. Diverting organic waste to compost facilities extends the life of landfills, reduces greenhouse-gas emissions from the waste sector and produces compost, a valuable soil additive that supports plant growth.    	    	Mother Earth Recycling is receiving $50,000 to launch a pilot project to recycle child car seats and furniture. This project builds on the success of electronics refurbishment and mattress recycling in Winnipeg by this Indigenous-owned and operated social enterprise.    	    	Product Care Association is receiving $450,000 to collect and properly dispose of stockpiled household hazardous waste such as spray-foam containers and propane. This initiative focuses on northern landfills and helps to ensure these materials do not enter the environment.     	    	The Manitoba Association of Regional Recyclers (MARR) is receiving $60,000 to support Manitoba recycling organizations in adapting to the new and developing challenges created by COVID-19. This funding supports the sharing of information on industry trends and best practices, and promotes cost-efficient and effective recycling in Manitoba.    	    	“Our members represent the grassroots of Manitoba’s community and regional recycling and waste diversion efforts,” said Deb Odegaard, chair of MARR (Flin Flon and District Recycling). “MARR is thrilled to continue our long-term partnership with the province, and we look forward to driving innovation and growth in our efforts to reduce waste and protect Manitoba’s land, air and water.”   	    	MARR is a non-profit association with members from community and regional recycling and waste reduction programs across the province. MARR focuses on education, information sharing and facilitating collaboration and partnerships between members    	    	Cleanfarms is receiving $185,000 to expand the collection and recycling of agricultural plastics in southern Manitoba. This program diverts grain bags and twine from landfills or on-site burning, extending the life of landfills and reducing air pollution.      	    	This announcement builds on the investment of $150 million for additional green initiatives to better protect the environment and support the goals and implementation of the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

The worker hit the stop button on the table saw, but the worker’s hand came into contact with the blade as it was coming to a stop.  As a result, the worker sustained an amputation and other significant injuries to the hand.     	The employer was fined $14,950 and an additional $1,250 to be used for educating the public on occupational safety and health.

This gap can lead to unnecessary emergency department visits,” said Friesen. “By closing the gap and expanding access to community drop-in space for people over the age of 18 with addictions and mental health issues, we are providing a safe place to rest or participate in recreational activities while providing appropriate care and resources.”   	    	A tendering process will be undertaken to award at least one existing community health organization in an urban and high-need area with annual funding to expand its drop-in capacity. Individuals using substances who do not require hospitalization will be able to go to the 24-7 community drop-in space as an alternative to remaining on the streets. This is expected to reduce the likelihood of police involvement, unneeded emergency department visits and other harmful situations, such as violence and injury.   	    	“We know that police and emergency department providers are being asked to support people with mental health and addiction issues, but this is not always the best way for individuals to get connected with other resources,” said Cullen. “Expanding services and ensuring staff with the right skills are in place to help people in their time of need will ensure our community has the right care in the right place at the right time.”   	    	The RFP, to be issued today, notes the need for the organization to hire and train peer support workers and others with experience in serving people with mental health and addictions issues. It is expected the space will be welcoming and non-stigmatizing while providing clients support to access other health and social services.   	    	It is also expected the expansion of drop-in services will complement a number of recent initiatives launched by the Manitoba government including:   	• the creation of six additional beds at HSC Winnipeg for patients with severe alcohol or drug intoxication, along with additional mental health, addictions and security staff within its emergency department;   	• the opening of women’s treatment beds at AFM Winnipeg and the Behavioural Health Foundation, as well as flexible-length withdrawal beds in Winnipeg and Brandon that are suitable for those with a meth addiction; and   	• the creation of 70 supportive recovery housing units, giving those recovering from addiction access to stable housing and a safe place to live as they transition back into their lives.    	    	“This investment builds on the strong partnerships we have forged with the exceptional community organizations who provide health and social support services to vulnerable individuals in Winnipeg,” said Sharon Kuropatwa, regional director for housing, supports and service integration, Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. “We are happy to offer this opportunity to provide enhanced resources to support the important work of these community agencies. This investment will help further develop a network that is meant to ensure people with mental health and addictions issues have the supports they need to regain their lives.”     	    	The ministers noted the province’s Safer Streets, Safer Lives Action Plan outlines the development of new recovery and drop-in centres. In addition, the investment will address a direct recommendation in the Illicit Drug Task Force Report and aligns with harm reduction recommendations in the VIRGO mental health and addictions strategy report.    	    	The Manitoba government has invested more than $42 million in new or expanded mental health and addictions services or programs since last fall, Friesen noted.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

We are able to provide disaster financial assistance programs for all three.”   	    	The provincial Hydrologic Forecast Centre identified a potential high water situation in the Red River Valley for spring 2020, during the event both the Red River Floodway and the Portage Diversion were activated. Provincial operations focused on the Red River Valley ring dike communities and included pumping, completing partial ring dike closures and ramping of roads for continued community access.   	    	The southeast area of the province received heavy rains from June 6 to 10, with some areas recording almost 200 millimetres of rain within three days. Overland flooding was reported in the rural municipalities (RM) of De Salaberry, Piney, Reynolds, La Broquerie and Stuartburn, as well as the Municipality of Emerson-Franklin.   	    	Another heavy rain event occurred June 28 to July 5 in western and southern Manitoba, impacting the communities of Minnedosa, Rapid City and Rivers as the rain-swollen Little Saskatchewan River made its way to the Assiniboine River. The heavy precipitation was a one-in-1,000-year rain event resulting in the province losing confidence in the provincial dam near Rivers. Recommendations were shared with municipalities to evacuate a limited number of properties as a precaution. The Portage Diversion was activated from July 2 to 9, to limit water flow in the lower Assiniboine River.    	    	Heavy precipitation in the upstream watershed of the Whitemud River caused a significant rise in levels along the river, exceeding 2011 levels.  Ten municipalities declared a state of local emergency and 20 municipalities were impacted by heavy rain.   	    	“Manitobans are always encouraged to check their insurance policies first, then consider a DFA program application,” said Schuler. “The DFA program should be used as a last resort.”   	    	DFA programs provide provincial assistance for certain disaster-related losses when a widespread natural disaster strikes and creates an unreasonable financial burden. Assistance is generally provided for recovery needs of local governments, occupied private residential properties, farms, small business and some not-for-profit organizations.   	    	“We are pleased to be able to offer these programs even at a time when COVID-19 is consuming an enormous amount of provincial resources,” said Schuler. “Preliminary estimates show at least two of the programs will be substantial enough for potential cost-sharing with the federal government through the federal disaster financial assistance arrangements.”   	    	The DFA application deadline for local authorities and those in the private sector is Dec. 10.    	    	- 30 -  "

The worker hit the stop button on the table saw, but the worker’s hand came into contact with the blade as it was coming to a stop.  As a result, the worker sustained an amputation and other significant injuries to the hand.     	The employer was fined $14,950 and an additional $1,250 to be used for educating the public on occupational safety and health. Rainbow Stage (1993) Inc. is a not-for-profit Manitoba theatre company governed by a board of directors and managed by a team of seven full-time employees.   	The province may publish information on stop work orders, administrative penalties and convictions to inform and educate employers and workers of their legal responsibilities under The Workplace Safety and Health Act and regulations. These measures are applied as behaviour-changing tools to encourage safe work practices. More information can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/labour/safety/compliance.html.

General public health guidelines suggest limiting in-person meetings and the extended order helps reduce the requirement for travel in northern and remote communities.    	• Manitoba Families – two temporary suspension orders will be combined into one order regarding Temporary Suspension of Youth in Care Provisions and the Temporary Suspension of Social Services and Child Care Provisions.  As well, relief of the Foster Homes Licensing Regulation and the Child Care Facilities (Other than Foster Homes) Licensing Regulation will be provided through a regulatory change. These provisions provide better outcomes for youth exiting care during these unprecedented times and allows nursery schools to continue operating under temporary models.    	• Manitoba Finance – one of the extensions will allow for the continued use of video conferencing to witness the signing of documents under subsections of The Homesteads Act and The Real Property Act. This temporary suspension of in-person commissioning and witnessing requirements provides a way for someone in isolation to sign documents safely. The temporary suspension of the requirement for in-person corporate meetings for condominium corporations, co-operatives, corporations and credit unions continues providing the option for required  meetings to be held, notified of and voted on electronically until March 31, 2021.     	• Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living – The Personal Care Home (PCH) Staffing and Work Deployment order will continue to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 by restricting staff from working in more than one PCH.

The extension continues to temporarily waive credential requirements for Manitoba carriers traveling to IFTA jurisdictions. Waiving this provision also helps Manitoba carriers bringing food, medical supplies and others goods into and out of the province.    	    	Orders not being renewed include:   	• Manitoba Finance – under the Residential Tenancies Branch, provisions will end related to non-urgent evictions, the suspension of hearings for non-urgent orders of possession, late fees for non-payment of rent and freezing rent increases. All of these provisions will be repealed, effective Oct. 1. The changes allow landlords to begin proceedings for evictions against tenants for non-payment of rent and other non-urgent issues. They will also be able to begin charging late fees on rent that is not paid on time on that date or later, but cannot charge fees on rent that was overdue while the suspension was in place.

To help ensure clarity and best practices are put in place, the minister of families has responded to the ombudsman today and asked for her assistance on the development of a new information management protocol, which would guide how personal information should be shared with the Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth and other independent offices and organizations.     	    	On Aug. 28, the department reported a privacy breach affecting about 9,000 children who are clients of Children’s disABILITY Services. Their personal information was being provided to the Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth but, because of a human error, was also shared with service agencies and advocacy organizations that work with people with disabilities. The information included personal information about these children, including their diagnosis and address, but did not include personal health identification numbers, social insurance numbers or any financial information.   	    	Manitoba Families has since contacted all affected families to advise them of the breach. The department has also reached out to all agencies that received the information to ensure it has been deleted. This breach highlighted the need for the department to develop stronger and more comprehensive policies on how information is secured and shared.     	    	The breach was reported to the Manitoba Ombudsman, which is standard practice. Manitoba Families also launched a forensic audit of its Children’s disABILITY Services emails and did not find any other breaches. Recognizing that it serves thousands of Manitobans, many considered vulnerable or with complex needs, the department has also put additional measures in place to help prevent errors in the future. A training webinar is being offered to employees this week focused on their responsibilities related to privacy and personal health information, how to send information more securely, strategies to help prevent privacy breaches and what to do if one occurs. All requests for client information from external organizations must now also be more formally reviewed by the department’s privacy unit to better protect clients’ personal information.    	    	A copy of a letter sent to the Manitoba Ombudsman today, along with more information for parents and caregivers about the privacy breach, is available at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/cds/privacy_breach.html.    	    	- 30 -  "

The creation of this fund will ensure their important work will continue for decades into the future, and will support climate and green education.”    	    	The provincial contribution to the fund will generate approximately $270,000 annually to support the interpretive centre, a 20 per cent increase over the previous provincial operating grant. The new endowment funding model will provide permanent, stable funding to support the interpretive centre and builds upon $1.5 million in provincial funds committed earlier this year to support upgrades to the facility.    	    	“This investment by the province will allow us to leverage the best in conservation science and education,” said Karla Guyn, CEO of Ducks Unlimited Canada. “It provides the financial stability needed to ensure our award-winning facility can continue providing Manitobans and visitors from around the world with hands-on opportunities to learn about wetlands and the critical role they play in building a sustainable future.”   	    	As part of the renewal of the interpretive centre, Ducks Unlimited Canada also announced today the renaming of the centre to the Harry J. Enns Wetland Discovery Centre to honour the legacy of local conservation champion Harry J. Enns. Enns was the member of the legislative assembly for Lakeside from 1966 to 2003, and championed the development of the interpretive centre, which is also the national headquarters for Ducks Unlimited Canada.    	    	“From the very beginning, our dad understood the benefits of this project both for Ducks Unlimited Canada, which he admired as a first-class organization, and to the thousands of Manitobans who would be able to visit the interpretive centre to experience first-hand the wonders and importance of a living wetland,” said Andrew Enns, son of Harry J. Enns.   	    	The establishment of the endowment fund will increase the value of the Interlake Community Foundation’s (ICF) funds six fold. The administrative fees generated from the fund will greatly enhance ICF’s ability to support additional priority community initiatives throughout the Interlake region.   	    	“Our government is committed to making strategic investments in climate-friendly infrastructure projects to support our goal of becoming Canada’s cleanest, greenest, most climate-resilient province,” Pallister added. “Our government is proud to support this world-class facility, ensuring a bright and sustainable future for all.”   	    	Located east of Stonewall, Oak Hammock Marsh is a 36-square-kilometre marsh featuring a restored prairie marsh, aspen-oak bluff, artesian springs and some of Manitoba’s last remaining patches of tall-grass prairie. It also features a theatre, a scenic cafe, a gift shop, meeting rooms, rooftop observation deck and interactive exhibits. Its interpretive centre welcomes close to 100,000 students, tourists and environmental professionals annually who can explore 30 kilometres of trails and lush natural habitat that is home to 25 species of mammals, 300 species of birds, numerous amphibians, reptiles, fish and invertebrates.   	    	For more information on Oak Hammock Marsh, visit www.oakhammockmarsh.ca/.   	    	- 30 -  "

We need good veterinarians in place to help us practise safe animal welfare and keep growing animal agriculture in Manitoba.”   	    	Saskatchewan Minister of Advanced Education Tina Beaudry-Mellor said, “Ensuring that educational opportunities meet labour-market expectations is a Growth Plan priority for our government. This agreement allows Saskatchewan, and our partner provinces, to communicate admissions’ priorities so they are in step with each province’s labour-market needs.”   	    	British Columbia Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training Melanie Mark said, “There is an increasing demand for veterinarians and veterinary research across Western Canada. This agreement helps us focus on equipping students from the western provinces with the expertise to return and practise in their home communities, where they are in demand.”   	    	University of Saskatchewan Interim Provost and Vice-president Academic Melissa Just said, “The WCVM is built on collaboration, and its people and programs strengthen the University of Saskatchewan’s impact in everything from agriculture and animal health to comparative medicine and public health. We’re excited to see what it will achieve with the renewed support of its provincial partners and our university.”   	    	The WCVM is the premier centre of veterinary education, research and expertise in Western Canada and a key member of Canada's veterinary, public health and food safety networks. The internationally accredited facility includes a veterinary medical centre, a provincial diagnostic laboratory and large-scale research facilities.   	    	The college’s new interprovincial agreement is in place until 2025.   	    	Find video greetings from Manitoba, British Columbia and Saskatchewan and University of Saskatchewan representatives at https://wcvm.usask.ca/ipa.php.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

Manitoba’s estimated 500,000 households will see average savings of $812, he added.   	    	The total includes Budget 2020 tax measures, indexation of the basic personal amount and the provincial income tax brackets, the reduction in the provincial sales tax (PST) rate to seven per cent from eight per cent as of July 1, 2019, and the accelerated removal of $75 million in PST on home and property insurance premiums as of July 1, 2020. It also factors in COVID-19 measures, such as the Seniors Economic Recovery Credit, Risk Recognition Program, Manitoba Public Insurance Rebates, Disability Economic Support Program and the Manitoba Bursary Programs.    	    	“Our focus is to provide Manitobans with better value for their hard-earned dollars and leave more money on everyone’s kitchen tables, especially as we continue to face the unknowns of this pandemic,” said Pallister. “Since 2016 we’ve made progress on decreasing the amount of taxes Manitobans pay and saving Manitobans more money each year.”   	    	Pallister said since 2016, provincial government measures have brought a cumulative total of $659.4 million in household savings, which results in an average savings of $1,319 per household.   	    	- 30 -   	   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

The remainder of the cost has been shared by Trails Manitoba and Trans Canada Trail, as well as through a significant donation from contractor Pier Solutions.   	    	The government’s financial contribution to the project is part of a larger $500,000 investment announced in April for constructing and improving trails in provincial parks. The ministers noted that the government is committed to continue building, maintaining and expanding Manitoba’s trail network in partnership with volunteer and community organizations.   	    	“We are delighted to have played a role in this wonderful project, which breathed new life into two wooden bridges and reinstalled them in the spectacular surroundings of Whiteshell Provincial Park,” said Eleanor McMahon, president and CEO, Trans Canada Trail. “We would like to thank the government of Manitoba for this important investment, which represents a clear signal of its commitment to and appreciation of the multi-faceted value of trails in our daily lives – from preserving nature and heritage to enhancing the physical and mental health of Manitobans – and we are grateful to our provincial partner, Trails Manitoba, for its leadership.”   	    	“During this period of uncertainty, recreational trails have seen unprecedented activity as restrictions have inspired Manitobans to further explore their province,” said Erik Dickson, president, Trails Manitoba. “By highlighting investments in our trails and celebrating these achievements, we draw attention to our beautiful province, and promote healthy and active living.”   	    	Pier Solutions removed the bridges from King’s Park in 2017 before the company refurbished and installed them in Whiteshell Provincial Park. Upon fabrication and completion of the footings, the components of the bridges were transported to a staging area and then brought by helicopter to their new sites.    	    	“The refurbishment, transport and installation of the bridges at Hanson’s Creek and Cabin Lake truly demonstrate the collaborative priorities of the project team,” said Jeana Manning, principal, Pier Solutions. “By working together, we overcame significant obstacles, ultimately providing Manitobans with two of the most cost-effective and picturesque pedestrian spans in Manitoba.”   	    	Short videos of the transport and installation of the bridges are online at https://youtu.be/7wdYLoldbQM (Cabin Lake) and https://youtu.be/gs_f9qOtUW0 (Hanson’s Creek).   	    	- 30 -   	   "

This funding is being provided to ensure both BPS and WPS have facilities with the appropriate capacity to support their police agencies.   	    	“This funding will provide the BPS with the ability to construct a modern detention facility that will help ensure the safety of our clients, staff and the community we serve,” said Chief Wayne Balcaen,  Brandon Police Service. “We also thank the Manitoba government for additional funding through the Criminal Property Forfeiture Fund, which will provide additional tools and training to our staff, and ultimately contribute to overall public safety.”   	    	“The Winnipeg Police Service would like to thank the province for its contribution toward the capital costs to address infrastructure challenges that emerged as a result of the changes in prisoner processing,” said acting Chief Arthur Stannard, Winnipeg Police Service. “These renovations that we will make in our Central Processing Unit will help us better meet the needs of our members and the detainees in our care.”      	    	The minister announced the province has also provided almost $200,000 to BPS this year through the Criminal Property Forfeiture Fund for training and equipment upgrades, noting $25,000 of the funding was shared with the Brandon Bear Clan organization to purchase a van for their operations.   	    	In Manitoba, cash and proceeds from the sale of forfeited property are deposited into the Criminal Property Forfeiture (CPF) Fund.

This could include amendments to The Petty Trespass Act, to ensure the law is easier to enforce and to prevent confrontations between landowners and trespassers, and to The Occupiers Liability Act to ensure a landowner’s legal responsibility for injury is fair and reasonable when someone is on their property without permission.   	    	Manitoba Justice will also engage with several key stakeholders about proposed changes including law enforcement agencies, municipalities, agricultural organizations, business groups and Indigenous leadership.    	    	“Community safety and crime prevention are among the top priorities of Manitoba municipalities and local councils have been ringing the alarm on increasing rural crime rates,” said Ralph Groening, president, Association of Manitoba Municipalities. “We commend the provincial government for seeking feedback from rural Manitoba to help combat rural crime and protect Manitobans in partnership with municipal officials and stakeholders.”    	    	The province will also consider amendments to The Animal Diseases Act to support food safety on Manitoba farms.

We are proud to partner with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection on this campaign, which highlights the importance of checking in with your kids regularly, setting limits, and knowing how to identify potential dangers.”   	C3P’s Cybertip.ca tipline has seen more than an 80 per cent increase in online child exploitation reports in recent months.   	The new campaign, which launches this week and runs until late fall, focuses on parents and caregivers of tweens aged eight to 12 who use live-stream apps, gaming platforms and live chat features. It includes television, print, digital and social media tools, with additional information and resources available at protectkidsonline.ca, a website which provides tips on what parents can do to keep kids safe online, along with age-appropriate points to talk about with tweens and teens.   	Free online safety lessons have also been developed for teachers with students in grades 3 to 8 on how to identify and respond to unsafe situations online.     	“It is imperative that we work collectively to raise awareness and mitigate risks surrounding online safety concerns facing tweens and teens,” said Signy Arnason, associate executive director, C3P. “Through Cybertip.ca, we are seeing kids as young as eight years old being targeted by adults through live stream apps, and in the last few years have processed over 300 reports involving child exploitation that originated in an online gaming environment. So it is important for parents and educators to have these online safety conversations at every age in order to keep kids safe.”   	The new online safety lessons, which are also available to families for free, can be accessed at protectchildren.ca/order.   	The Manitoba government first announced its support for this campaign in early March. It supports the work of the province’s sexual exploitation strategy, Tracia’s Trust, and the findings of the Collaboration and Best Practices to End Sex Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation in Manitoba research report, which was released last year. The need for increased public awareness about sexual exploitation and the risks to Manitoba youth was also highlighted by the Advisory Council of Knowledge Keepers, which provides guidance and the inclusion of experiential voices to the province on these important issues.   	C3P is a national charity dedicated to the personal safety of all children. The organization’s goal is to reduce the sexual abuse and exploitation of children through programs, services and resources for Canadian families, educators, child-serving organizations, law enforcement and other parties. C3P also operates Cybertip.ca, Canada’s national tipline to report child sexual abuse and exploitation on the Internet.

This could include amendments to The Petty Trespass Act, to ensure the law is easier to enforce and to prevent confrontations between landowners and trespassers, and to The Occupiers Liability Act to ensure a landowner’s legal responsibility for injury is fair and reasonable when someone is on their property without permission.   	    	Manitoba Justice will also engage with several key stakeholders about proposed changes including law enforcement agencies, municipalities, agricultural organizations, business groups and Indigenous leadership.    	    	“Community safety and crime prevention are among the top priorities of Manitoba municipalities and local councils have been ringing the alarm on increasing rural crime rates,” said Ralph Groening, president, Association of Manitoba Municipalities. “We commend the provincial government for seeking feedback from rural Manitoba to help combat rural crime and protect Manitobans in partnership with municipal officials and stakeholders.”    	    	The province will also consider amendments to The Animal Diseases Act to support food safety on Manitoba farms. Manitobans are invited to provide feedback on potential legislation that would enhance biosecurity and reduce hazards at food production premises with livestock or other animals.   	    	“Agriculture and food production is an important part of Manitoba’s economy and is a vital contributor to the health and wellbeing of people,” said Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen. “Our goal is to ensure that food produced in Manitoba is safe for human consumption and that food safety will never be compromised.”   	    	Manitobans can provide their feedback through the public engagement questionnaire at https://engagemb.ca until Oct. 31.    	    	- 30 -  "

We are proud to partner with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection on this campaign, which highlights the importance of checking in with your kids regularly, setting limits, and knowing how to identify potential dangers.”   	C3P’s Cybertip.ca tipline has seen more than an 80 per cent increase in online child exploitation reports in recent months.   	The new campaign, which launches this week and runs until late fall, focuses on parents and caregivers of tweens aged eight to 12 who use live-stream apps, gaming platforms and live chat features. It includes television, print, digital and social media tools, with additional information and resources available at protectkidsonline.ca, a website which provides tips on what parents can do to keep kids safe online, along with age-appropriate points to talk about with tweens and teens.   	Free online safety lessons have also been developed for teachers with students in grades 3 to 8 on how to identify and respond to unsafe situations online.     	“It is imperative that we work collectively to raise awareness and mitigate risks surrounding online safety concerns facing tweens and teens,” said Signy Arnason, associate executive director, C3P. “Through Cybertip.ca, we are seeing kids as young as eight years old being targeted by adults through live stream apps, and in the last few years have processed over 300 reports involving child exploitation that originated in an online gaming environment. So it is important for parents and educators to have these online safety conversations at every age in order to keep kids safe.”   	The new online safety lessons, which are also available to families for free, can be accessed at protectchildren.ca/order.   	The Manitoba government first announced its support for this campaign in early March. It supports the work of the province’s sexual exploitation strategy, Tracia’s Trust, and the findings of the Collaboration and Best Practices to End Sex Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation in Manitoba research report, which was released last year. The need for increased public awareness about sexual exploitation and the risks to Manitoba youth was also highlighted by the Advisory Council of Knowledge Keepers, which provides guidance and the inclusion of experiential voices to the province on these important issues.   	C3P is a national charity dedicated to the personal safety of all children. The organization’s goal is to reduce the sexual abuse and exploitation of children through programs, services and resources for Canadian families, educators, child-serving organizations, law enforcement and other parties. C3P also operates Cybertip.ca, Canada’s national tipline to report child sexual abuse and exploitation on the Internet.

On Aug. 26, CDS staff accidentally sent an email intended for the Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth (MACY) to about 100 agencies and advocacy groups.  The email contained a spreadsheet with information about approximately 9,000 children who are CDS clients, as well as information about a matter currently being reviewed by MACY. It included personal information about these children, including their diagnosis and address, but did not include personal health identification numbers, social insurance numbers or any financial information. The spreadsheet was password-protected, but the password was also provided.   	Yesterday, the province called service agencies and advocacy groups that received the email in error to confirm it was deleted. Manitoba Families has agreements in place with service providers that set out expectations for protecting personal information, in addition to their broader legal requirement to protect privacy and confidentiality.   	The province is calling all of the affected families to advise them of the breach and apologize for the error, and will also follow up by email or mail. Manitoba Families recognizes it has a serious responsibility to protect the personal information of its clients.     	The mistake was human error, however the department is following up with staff to review and improve processes to avoid this happening again.

The goal was to upgrade PTH 100 to a freeway standard with no at-grade crossings from the Trans-Canada Highway West interchange at Portage Avenue to the Trans-Canada Highway East interchange at Fermor Avenue. Intersecting roadways and railways would be separated through interchanges and overpasses.   	The province began its public engagement process in 2018 to inform the study and present design options. It held nine public open houses between August 2018 and December 2019, during all three design development phases.  The minister noted the province had last studied the overall capacity and efficiency of PTH 100 in 1988.   	“With increased use of the highway over the past 30 years and growth in both south Winnipeg and communities south of the city, we required an updated report to address safety, operational and capacity deficiencies, and the general physical condition of the roadway,” said Schuler. “The South Perimeter plays a significant economic role in transporting people, goods and services and we want to ensure the highway is safe, efficient and progressive.”   	The new South Perimeter Highway Design Study includes engagement from stakeholders and the public, and encompasses land in the rural municipalities of Headingley, Macdonald and Springfield and the City of Winnipeg.   	The study outlines two phases of changes for PTH 100. The initial stage, designed to accommodate forecasted 2048 traffic levels, will include upgrading the highway to a four-lane divided freeway and improving the structure, interchanges and bridges. The final stage will include upgrading PTH 100 to a six-lane divided freeway, reconfiguring the existing highway and constructing new interchanges where necessary. The province will monitor traffic volumes and levels of service in the coming years to dictate the time of additional construction.   	Projects approved for design and construction in the next year include:  	•    St. Mary’s Road interchange (construction to start in late 2021);                  	•    service road at Aimes Road and Melnick Road (construction to start in 2021);  	•    West Perimeter Highway service road from Wilkes Avenue to Oakland Road (construction to start in late 2020); and  	•    Brady Road service road (construction started in June 2020).

The goal was to upgrade PTH 100 to a freeway standard with no at-grade crossings from the Trans-Canada Highway West interchange at Portage Avenue to the Trans-Canada Highway East interchange at Fermor Avenue. Intersecting roadways and railways would be separated through interchanges and overpasses.   	The province began its public engagement process in 2018 to inform the study and present design options. It held nine public open houses between August 2018 and December 2019, during all three design development phases.  The minister noted the province had last studied the overall capacity and efficiency of PTH 100 in 1988.   	“With increased use of the highway over the past 30 years and growth in both south Winnipeg and communities south of the city, we required an updated report to address safety, operational and capacity deficiencies, and the general physical condition of the roadway,” said Schuler. “The South Perimeter plays a significant economic role in transporting people, goods and services and we want to ensure the highway is safe, efficient and progressive.”   	The new South Perimeter Highway Design Study includes engagement from stakeholders and the public, and encompasses land in the rural municipalities of Headingley, Macdonald and Springfield and the City of Winnipeg.   	The study outlines two phases of changes for PTH 100. The initial stage, designed to accommodate forecasted 2048 traffic levels, will include upgrading the highway to a four-lane divided freeway and improving the structure, interchanges and bridges. The final stage will include upgrading PTH 100 to a six-lane divided freeway, reconfiguring the existing highway and constructing new interchanges where necessary. The province will monitor traffic volumes and levels of service in the coming years to dictate the time of additional construction.   	Projects approved for design and construction in the next year include:  	•    St. Mary’s Road interchange (construction to start in late 2021);                  	•    service road at Aimes Road and Melnick Road (construction to start in 2021);  	•    West Perimeter Highway service road from Wilkes Avenue to Oakland Road (construction to start in late 2020); and  	•    Brady Road service road (construction started in June 2020).   	The South Perimeter Highway Design Study is available at: www.gov.mb.ca/mit/hpd/pth100/studies.html.   	- 30 -  "

These programs will be delivered in partnership with the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce and Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce, and include:   	•    up to $4 million for workplaces to offer on-site child care services for their employees, expected to create up to 800 new spaces through a $5,000-per-space start-up grant;  	•    up to $1.5 million in grants to home-based child care providers, to enhance their child care spaces, support financial stability and help ensure new spaces, to a maximum of $50,000 per provider;  	•    up to $2 million for licensed child care providers to establish satellite locations, which will help support their ongoing operations and physical distancing requirements as part of the COVID-19 pandemic response;  	•    up to $750,000 for community organizations to develop more diverse child care options to meet the needs of their families, which could reflect different cultures, languages and accessibility needs; and  	•    up to $250,000 to help ensure child care providers participating in these programs can find and retain families to fill available spaces, through a comprehensive marketing plan.   	“As Manitoba businesses continue to recover from the economic impacts of COVID-19, these new programs and investments in child care are critical to a growing economy,” said Chuck Davidson, president and CEO of the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce, which represents 71 local chambers of commerce in the province and close to 10,000 businesses.   	“The removal of obstacles to Manitobans returning to the workplace is a critical piece in re-opening the economy,” said Loren Remillard, president and CEO of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce. “The Winnipeg Chamber is pleased to be a program partner, offering valuable business advisory services to a broader array of applicants, which will contribute to both expanded child care offerings and peace of mind for Manitoba families.”   	More information on the new grant programs is available at www.manitoba.ca/childcare. Applications will be posted and begin being accepted on Sept. 1.   	“The grant program and the chambers of commerce supported me so that I can provide child care during this unprecedented time,” said Rupinder Singh, home child care provider. “This allowed essential worker families to have access to child care. I also thank the chambers for weekly mentorship sessions, and for being available if I needed advice.”     	The province is also following through on a commitment set out in Budget 2020 by allocating an additional $9.5 million into the new Child Care Sustainability Trust, which will launch in March 2021. The trust will support a variety of innovative projects at child care facilities including programming and infrastructure improvements, equipment, and professional development and learning opportunities for staff, with the goal of enhancing inclusive and accessible services.   	In addition, the province is committing $4.7 million in new funding to expand the Child Care Centre Development Tax Credit, in order to support the creation of employer-based child care centres for up to 682 children.  This is in addition to the over $2-million investment made when the tax credit launched in 2018. Since that time, support has been allocated to four businesses in Winnipeg, Selkirk and Altona to establish child care centres for 260 children.   	For more information on the Child Care Centre Development Tax Credit, established as part of Budget 2018, visit www.gov.mb.ca/fs/childcare/resources/centre_dev_tax_credit.html.   	The province first announced $18 million for a temporary child care services grant as part of the COVID-19 pandemic response so licensed child care providers who were unable to work at their regular child care facilities could provide care in home-based settings. To date, 20 child care providers have accessed the grant and created more than 130 spaces to meet the needs of parents and caregivers.     	As Manitoba families return to work and school, they can continue to access child care services using Manitoba’s web portal at eswchildcare.ca to find vacancies and contact providers directly.   	The child care system established to respond to the pandemic has so far resulted in over 900 child care facilities re-opening across the province, offering more than 21,000 spaces. The minister noted the supply of child care has now exceeded demand as the province re-opens.   	As part of the recently launched #RestartMB Pandemic Response System, the Manitoba government has provided additional information and guidance for families and child care providers on COVID-19.

While the risk of transmission is considered low, information is being provided to help people assess their risk and seek testing if symptoms appear.   	Manitobans are strongly encouraged to return to the fundamentals to help stop the spread of COVID-19. This means not going out while you feel ill, practicing proper hand hygiene, covering your cough and physical distancing when you are with people outside your household. If you can’t physical distance, wear a mask.   	Testing numbers show an additional 1,206 laboratory tests were completed on Tuesday, bringing the total number of tests completed since early February to 129,409.   	Unless recommended by public health, only individuals experiencing COVID-19 symptoms should go for testing. Individuals with symptoms are asked to seek testing as soon as possible once symptoms are present.   	Employers are asked to only send employees for testing if they have symptoms or if testing has been recommended by public health.

To meet additional demand and support employers to hire and bring back more staff, we are doubling the number of employees eligible for a wage subsidy.”   	As part of #RestartMB, Manitoba’s roadmap to recovery, the Back to Work Manitoba Initiative supports the province’s economic recovery by encouraging private sector or non-profit employers to bring back laid-off employees or make new hires. The program will reimburse 50 per cent of wage costs (up to $5,000) per employee hired or re-hired between July 16 and Oct. 31, 2020.   	The enhanced program will now allow businesses, not-for-profit organizations or charities to receive a subsidy for another 10 full or part-time employees, in addition to the current total of 10. By doubling the amount of subsidized employees to 20, the maximum level of financial support available to employers increases from $50,000 to $100,000.   	“As we learn to live with COVID-19, our government continues to look for safe opportunities to get Manitobans back to work,” said Pallister. “Many businesses are adapting and finding ways to operate safely and offer services that Manitobans rely on, and we want to support them as they rebuild to pre-pandemic staffing levels.”   	The premier noted the Back to Work Manitoba Initiative has received applications from 445 employers for 2,429 employees and over $12 million in financial supports, as of Aug. 25. Nearly 40 per cent of employers accessing wage subsidies have applied for the maximum ten employees. In the restaurant and hospitality industry, almost two-thirds of applicants have maximized their subsidy for 10 hires.   	The program is open to applicants of the Summer Student Recovery Jobs program and Back to Work This Summer Program to make any additional hires. However, positions already receiving funding through other federal or provincial government programs are ineligible.   	The application deadline is Oct. 1. Employers will be required to provide proof of payment of wages by Jan. 4, 2021.

Today, the Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, and the Honourable Heather Stefanson, Manitoba’s Minister of Families, announced additional support for early learning and child care through the one-year Canada-Manitoba Early Learning and Child Care Agreement.     	“High-quality early learning experiences are essential to the intellectual, emotional and physical development of our children,” said Hussen. “The Government of Canada is pleased to continue working with the Government of Manitoba to ensure that all children and families in Manitoba have equal access to the quality early learning and child care they need to succeed.”   	“Child care is a priority for the Government of Manitoba and for Manitoba families, especially as we continue to respond to and recover from the pandemic,” said Stefanson. “The extension of our bilateral funding agreement provides significant, ongoing support to the sector as we work together to ensure families have access to child care choices that meet their needs.”   	The agreement allocates over $15 million in 2020–21 for early learning and child care investments in Manitoba. The Government of Manitoba’s action plan for 2020–21 continues to build on the success of the original pillars and initiatives of its early learning and child care plan, while considering the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and any potential future system disruptions.   	In particular, the province will continue to invest in creating inclusive child care spaces, maintain its free online Science of Early Development living textbook, expand its core professional development program and mentorship program for at-home providers, and create a one-time, $1.5 million COVID-19 Response Grant for facilities that have re-opened during the pandemic.   	For Canadian families, high-quality, affordable child care is more than a convenience—it’s a necessity. The Government of Canada and the Government of Manitoba are ensuring that every child gets the best possible start in life.   	This funding supports the Manitoba government’s annual investment of more than $181 million in early learning and child care initiatives.   	The federal government is now working with each jurisdiction to negotiate one-year bilateral agreements that will provide $400 million in 2020–21. This funding will continue to support the early learning and child care sector and will build on previous success. In addition, the Government of Canada recently announced $625 million to address the reduced availability of child care and the unique needs stemming from the pandemic across Canada. This year, the Government of Canada will invest almost $1.2 billion in total in early learning and child care.   	The federal government entered into bilateral agreements with all provinces and territories to provide them with $1.2 billion over three years for early learning and child care programs, starting in 2017–18. This builds on Manitoba’s investments of more than $540 million over the same period. These important investments in early learning and child care helped to create close to 40,000 more affordable child care spaces nationally prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The requirement, which takes effect province-wide on Sept. 1, also extends to outpatients attending appointments at clinics within hospitals and health centres throughout the province. While primary care clinics and other locations providing health services are not currently included in the mask requirement, all Manitobans are strongly encouraged to wear a non-medical mask when seeking care, said Friesen.   	This requirement is already in place in the Prairie Mountain Health region, where the use of masks is mandatory in all indoor public places as the region is currently listed as Restricted (orange) under the #RestartMB Pandemic Response System.   	“Wearing masks provides additional protection for people, particularly in indoor spaces where physical distancing is not possible,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “Wearing masks in hospitals and health centres will ensure we are all doing what we can to protect ourselves and others from this virus.”   	Visitors are asked to arrive at facilities with their own non-medical mask. Those who do not have a mask will be notified of locations where they may be purchased. In certain circumstances, they will be provided with one.   	The policy expands upon a requirement already in place for more than a month at personal care homes, where visitors are mandated to wear non-medical masks during indoor visits. It also builds on a number of initiatives implemented since the start of the pandemic to protect patients and staff at Manitoba health-care facilities from COVID-19, including:  	•    appropriate use of personal protective equipment;  	•    enhanced visitor restrictions;  	•    routine deep cleans of clinical departments, including examination and waiting rooms;  	•    daily screening of staff prior to the start of their shifts; and  	•    implementation of the single-site staffing model at personal care homes.   	Friesen noted the non-medical mask requirement does not apply to children under the age of two, as well as those with an underlying medical condition that may inhibit their ability to wear a mask.

The minister specified the funding will focus on putting in place the public health measures needed to keep students and staff as safe as possible while learning. This additional funding will be distributed on a per-student basis, with a portion of it to be held in reserve to be able to quickly respond to emerging challenges.   	This one-time, focused funding will be used to directly support schools, teachers, and students across the province by:  	•    providing non-medical and medical masks and personal protective equipment for students, teachers and staff;  	•    enhancing cleaning and sanitization, including more supplies and custodial staffing;  	•    increasing bus transportation capacity, including additional bus drivers and routes; and  	•    ensuring substitute teachers and educational staff are available to keep schools open and children learning.   	Manitoba Education and public health officials are committed to ensuring a safe return to school. Already, 4.7 million masks have been delivered to school divisions from the province, with more to come throughout the school year. Funding will also be available to enhance the sanitization of schools and buses and to ensure that school divisions have access to additional supports needed to keep schools clean and safe. The province continues to work with school divisions to assess the need for this extraordinary funding support and to identify challenges as they arise.   	On a per-capita basis, this dedicated COVID-19 funding is the second-highest of any province in the country for the safe reopening of schools. Manitoba’s investment in elementary and secondary education has increased annually since 2016, totaling $33 million in additional funding.   	“We thank our teachers, students and staff for taking on the extra challenges associated with making classrooms safe under the new constraints of COVID-19,” said Goertzen. “The province will continue to work closely with public health, education stakeholders, school divisions, independent schools, parents, caregivers and students as part of its response to COVID-19 and a safe return to school.”   	The Practice Guidance and Protocols for Restoring Safe Schools document, released last month, will change to reflect the latest guidance on this issue and is posted at:  www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/covid/index.html.   	The EngageMB website at https://engagemb.ca/welcoming-our-students-back-restoring-safe-schools remains the best forum for parents, caregivers and students to post questions for response throughout the return to classroom learning.   	- 30 -    	   "

Today, the Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, and the Honourable Heather Stefanson, Manitoba’s Minister of Families, announced additional support for early learning and child care through the one-year Canada-Manitoba Early Learning and Child Care Agreement.     	“High-quality early learning experiences are essential to the intellectual, emotional and physical development of our children,” said Hussen. “The Government of Canada is pleased to continue working with the Government of Manitoba to ensure that all children and families in Manitoba have equal access to the quality early learning and child care they need to succeed.”   	“Child care is a priority for the Government of Manitoba and for Manitoba families, especially as we continue to respond to and recover from the pandemic,” said Stefanson. “The extension of our bilateral funding agreement provides significant, ongoing support to the sector as we work together to ensure families have access to child care choices that meet their needs.”   	The agreement allocates over $15 million in 2020–21 for early learning and child care investments in Manitoba. The Government of Manitoba’s action plan for 2020–21 continues to build on the success of the original pillars and initiatives of its early learning and child care plan, while considering the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and any potential future system disruptions.   	In particular, the province will continue to invest in creating inclusive child care spaces, maintain its free online Science of Early Development living textbook, expand its core professional development program and mentorship program for at-home providers, and create a one-time, $1.5 million COVID-19 Response Grant for facilities that have re-opened during the pandemic.   	For Canadian families, high-quality, affordable child care is more than a convenience—it’s a necessity. The Government of Canada and the Government of Manitoba are ensuring that every child gets the best possible start in life.   	This funding supports the Manitoba government’s annual investment of more than $181 million in early learning and child care initiatives.   	The federal government is now working with each jurisdiction to negotiate one-year bilateral agreements that will provide $400 million in 2020–21. This funding will continue to support the early learning and child care sector and will build on previous success. In addition, the Government of Canada recently announced $625 million to address the reduced availability of child care and the unique needs stemming from the pandemic across Canada. This year, the Government of Canada will invest almost $1.2 billion in total in early learning and child care.   	The federal government entered into bilateral agreements with all provinces and territories to provide them with $1.2 billion over three years for early learning and child care programs, starting in 2017–18. This builds on Manitoba’s investments of more than $540 million over the same period. These important investments in early learning and child care helped to create close to 40,000 more affordable child care spaces nationally prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Public Health COVID-19 Contact Centre was established in April to support the province’s COVID-19 response by providing additional support to Public Health officials responsible for making daily contact with individuals isolating after being identified as close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The province is looking to build additional capacity as the need for support increases with increased case counts and associated close contacts.   	    	“The health system’s existing contact tracing and case investigation functions have proven invaluable during the first few months of this pandemic,” said Helwer. “By acquiring the additional contact tracing services, Manitobans can be confident their government is doing everything it can to be prepared for what this virus will pose in the months ahead.”   	    	To further ensure emergency preparedness, a Manitoba Emergency Response Warehouse (MERW) will be established to create a sustainable approach to stockpiling critical supplies and equipment going forward. The MERW will host a robust supply of medical equipment and materials, including personal protective equipment, to reinforce health-care system and public-sector supplies, Helwer noted.   	    	The RFP has been posted to MERX at www.merx.com under an open tendering process.

Parents and caregivers will continue to choose whether younger students should wear a mask. Further guidance on exceptions will be available soon regarding specific mask-free time and for those not recommended to wear a mask.   	    	“Wearing a mask offers an extra layer of protection, especially for indoor public spaces where physical distancing cannot be maintained,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “We all have a role to play, and we want to be sure that we take every step we can to ensure the return to school is a safe one.

This ensures public health remains a top priority while minimizing impacts on the economy and services for Manitobans.   	    	The #RestartMB Pandemic Response System, the first of its kind in Canada, is based on a series of COVID-19 indicators monitored by public health officials to give Manitobans a clear and detailed picture of the situation throughout the province at all times. Those COVID-19 indicators include health system capacity, public health capacity, risk of outbreaks in vulnerable settings and risk of importation of cases.    	    	The four colour-coded response levels are:    	• (red) critical – community spread of COVID-19 is not contained and/or there are significant strains on the health-care system;   	• (orange) restricted – community transmission of COVID-19 is occurring, public health measures are being taken to manage the negative impact on human health and/or the health system;   	• (yellow) caution – community transmission of COVID-19 is at low levels; and    	• (green) limited risk – the spread of COVID-19 is broadly contained and a vaccine and/or effective treatment is available.    	    	The system launched with a provincewide level of ‘caution’, meaning COVID-19 is still a threat across Manitoba, but community transmission levels are low. There are multiple and isolated clusters of cases which are mostly contained. For more information on the COVID-19 indicators and the four response levels, visit https://manitoba.ca/covid19/prs/system.html.    	    	“We must learn to live with this virus, and be prepared to both respond and adapt to changes in the transmission risks COVID-19 presents,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer. “The Pandemic Response System is a key preparedness tool setting out what Manitobans must do, at each response level, to help reduce risks and minimize the spread of this virus.”   	    	The site outlines steps Manitobans should be taking at each response level, as well as public health orders and guidance for businesses, service providers and other sectors.   	    	At all response levels, Manitobans should continue to follow the public health fundamentals. Those include:   	• always stay home when sick, even if mildly ill;   	• enhanced hand hygiene;   	• maintain physical distancing; and   	• wear masks in public indoor settings where physical distancing is not possible.   	    	The #Restart Pandemic Response System supports the Manitoba government's roadmap to recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is strongly recommended that students in grades 5 to 12, school staff and others in schools wear non-medical masks in common areas and where physical distancing of two metres is not possible. Younger students can also use non-medical masks if they or their parents or caregivers so choose. Non-medical masks should not be worn by anyone who is unable to remove one without assistance or by those with breathing difficulties.   	    	All students in Grade 5 and up, and bus drivers, will be required to wear non-medical masks on school buses. Masks should be put on before loading and taken off after off-loading.    	    	The province will provide masks to school divisions for distribution to students and staff, as well as other personal protective equipment to ensure safe and healthy schools, Goertzen noted.    	    	Manitoba Education’s Practice Guidance and Protocols for Restoring Safe Schools has been prepared in response to school division and independent school planning for the return to classroom learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The protocols are fully consistent with provincial Public Health and Health Canada guidance.   	    	“Public Health officials worked closely with Manitoba Education and are confident this plan balances the safety of students with the importance of returning to classroom learning,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “As always, the simplest and most effective prevention measures are staying home when sick, practising proper hand hygiene, covering your cough, and not sharing items with others.”   	    	Should a case of COVID-19 occur at a school, Public Health will work closely with school administrators to identify close contacts, notify them and advise them to self-isolate. The areas of a school where exposures took place will be cleaned and disinfected, and these areas will not be used until it is determined safe to do so. School communities will be notified when a student at their school is a confirmed case, once close contacts have been identified. A closure of a school would be a last resort and only with evidence of transmission among multiple groups of students or staff, Roussin noted.    	    	School divisions will post their individual plans during the week of Aug. 17 for the return to schools and the plans will be linked to the Manitoba Education website. Each division’s plan will outline procedures for following Public Health orders and guidelines, for addressing the mental health and well-being of the school community, and for communicating information to students, staff and families.   	    	“The goal of the Restoring Safe Schools plan is to maximize in-class learning while maintaining a focus on safety,” said Goertzen. “Parents and students need to know there is a process in place in the event students become ill and how their safety will be maintained.”    	    	The province will work closely with Public Health, education stakeholders, school divisions, independent schools, parents, caregivers and students to ensure consistent, timely and responsive information, and to act on issues as they arise.   	    	The EngageMB website at https://engagemb.ca/welcoming-our-students-back-restoring-safe-schools will remain the best forum for parents, caregivers and students to post questions for response throughout the return to classroom learning. In addition, a telephone town hall for parents, caregivers and students is scheduled for Aug. 18 with Roussin and Goertzen.    	    	For more information on COVID-19, www.manitoba.ca/covid19/ or Manitoba Education’s latest COVID-19 Education News website at www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/covid/index.html.   	    	- 30 -   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED   "

These projects follow through on our government’s commitment to build strong partnerships with community-based organizations, empowering them to become housing leaders.”    	    	“It is with great pleasure that our government, through the National Housing Strategy, is supporting organizations like Habitat for Humanity Manitoba, as well as the Wahbung Abinoonjiiag Inc., with two very important projects, here in Winnipeg,” said Duguid, “It’s through strong partnerships with organizations such as these, where we are better able to lift vulnerable populations of all races, age, and gender, meet their dream of home ownership and find affordable places to call home.”   	    	Habitat for Humanity Manitoba will receive $3 million to support its home-building program over three years. In that time, it expects to construct up to 60 new affordable homes with this funding and with additional support from other partners.    	    	“We are truly grateful for this vote of confidence in Habitat’s program, especially in this most difficult year,” said Sandy Hopkins, chief executive officer, Habitat for Humanity Manitoba. “Our partnership with the province spans more than a decade but has never been stronger.”   	    	Habitat for Humanity Manitoba will identify and work with qualifying families to support their journey to affordable home ownership. Families are responsible for a minimum of 500 volunteer hours, also known as ‘sweat equity’, prior to purchasing their home, including 100 hours helping with the construction of their home. The homes are then sold at fair market value, without a down payment and with a no-interest mortgage. The mortgage payment is renewed annually and is based on the family’s gross income.   	    	Another $635,000 from the National Housing Strategy will be used to demolish and transfer ownership of a vacant Manitoba Housing property on Watt Street in Winnipeg, valued at $516,000, to Wahbung Abinoonjiiag Inc. The organization plans to redevelop the land into new affordable housing for vulnerable families that are at risk of homelessness or that have experienced family violence.   	    	“With financial support from the province and the National Housing Strategy, guidance and expertise of our community partners, and the wisdom of our elders and families with lived experience, Wahbung Abinoonjiiag is breaking ground on a transitional housing project that will ensure 24 families impacted by homelessness and family violence have a culturally safe and family-centred place to call home,” said Dana Riccio-Arabe, executive director, Wahbung Abinoonjiiag Inc. “This collaborative model and wrap-around approach brings community together to support community, building on the inherent strengths of our families and walking alongside them on their healing journey.”   	    	The Government of Canada is currently rolling out its National Housing Strategy, an ambitious 10-year, more than $55-billion plan that will create 125,000 new housing units and lift 530,000 families out of housing need, as well as repair and renew more than 300,000 housing units and reduce chronic homelessness by 50 per cent. It is built on strong partnerships between federal, provincial and territorial governments and on continuous engagement with others, including municipalities, Indigenous governments and organizations, and with the social and private sectors to make a meaningful difference in the lives of Canadians. For more information, visit www.placetocallhome.ca.   	    	Manitoba Housing owns and manages nearly 13,000 affordable and social housing units in the province and provides support to another 4,000 affordable housing units that are managed by other organizations. Stefanson noted the Manitoba government has supported the creation of 631 new social and affordable housing units since 2016. During the same period, the government has also supported home ownership for more than 180 households through partnerships with municipalities, non-profit organizations and the province’s Rural Home Ownership Program.

B2B Manitoba was launched in May to help connect Manitoba businesses with non-medical grade personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies needed to operate safely. The province has provided $422,000 in support for the app including enhancements. Since its introduction, more than 1,700 users have already accessed the tool and new users are joining daily to access more than 1,000 listings.   	    	“Manitoba manufacturers have stepped up to the plate in a big way. Not only has the sector kept our economy running as an essential service, many manufacturers have retooled to provide the critical PPE and health and safety products we need to keep our economy operating safely,” said Ron Koslowsky, vice-president, CME. “B2B Manitoba offers a way for businesses across the province to enhance local supply chains as we help one another through the next phase of the pandemic.”   	    	Recent enhancements now allow businesses to contract health and safety services, such as product installation, laundry, cleaning and disinfection. In addition to the opportunity to list and access health and safety services, the enhanced tool now includes:    	• a helpful home page explanation video;    	• the ability to save search queries, page places and filters for an improved user experience that allows visitors to more easily browse and navigate the site; and    	• manufacturing location, shipping time and ships-from data.   	    	“Early on in the pandemic, Manitoba business leaders expressed concerns about PPE availability, and B2B Manitoba launched quickly to address those concerns,” says Chuck Davidson, president and CEO, Manitoba Chambers of Commerce. “As our economy restarts, it’s critical for businesses to have access to PPE to operate safely, and for manufacturers and suppliers to connect. These enhancements to the app make it even easier for users to locate what they need.”   	    	Additional enhancements also encourage vendors to list smaller lot sizes, which in turn will help small businesses operate on a just-in-time basis and manage inventory.   	    	“As our province started to reopen, our members made it clear sourcing PPE was a huge challenge,” says Loren Remillard, president and CEO, Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce. “B2B Manitoba was a critical resource for businesses at a critical time and enhancements to the platform continue to make it an essential part of any reopening plan.”   	    	Developed by Winnipeg-based firm Permission Click, B2B Manitoba is secured with the same level of encryption used by leading financial institutions and government agencies so businesses and suppliers can be assured their data is fully protected when using the site.    	    	“Manitoba has led the way in creating this unique platform that helps all Manitobans,” said Joelle Foster, CEO, North Forge Technology Exchange. “I want to stress that this is available for any business, including not for profits, schools and daycares. These enhancements are timely, as there has been more demand for services in relation to COVID-19.  We all have a part to play in reducing the spread of the virus and ensuring the well-being of everyone.”   	    	For more information on the B2B Manitoba app, visit www.b2bmanitoba.ca.    	    	- 30 -   	   "

However, if the province is asked to deliver the program on behalf of the federal government, the province will review the legislation to determine if provincial changes are required, the premier noted.   	    	“Manitobans and Canadians want safe work, but we can only achieve that if we continue to follow the fundamentals and the advice of our public health-care teams,” Pallister added. “We will continue to work with the federal government and our provincial and territorial colleagues to expedite the delivery of this important program to protect the health and well-being of all Canadians, especially those most vulnerable.”   	    	Earlier this spring, the Manitoba government passed legislation to provide job protection for Manitobans who are self-isolating, or are caring for a family member due to COVID-19. As well, the province will compensate health-care workers who are required to self-isolate for 14 days due to possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, the premier added.   	    	For up-to-date information on COVID-19 in Manitoba, visit www.manitoba.ca/COVID19.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

Safe. Grow. the Roadmap to Manitoba's Recovery:  Pallister  Watch news conference       	The Manitoba government has formally launched its #RestartMB campaign as a roadmap to recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.   	    	“Public health and safety is a key driver of recovery, and as we continue to safely restart our economy and reopen our communities, we must learn to live with this virus,” said Pallister. “We are committed to being ready for what lies ahead – ready to live with COVID-19, ready to return to school, ready to restart our services, create jobs and grow our economy.”   	    	The #RestartMB campaign will focus on both public safety and economic recovery. The tagline Ready. Safe. Grow. reinforces these messages:   	• Manitoba is ready for what lies ahead – ready to live with COVID-19, ready to return to school, ready to restart services, create jobs and grow the economy. The government’s actions and investment in being ready include the Manitoba Gap Protection Program, wage subsidies and Restoring Safe Schools plan.   	• Staying safe is the first step to growth. The province must continue to act and follow public health advice to keep COVID-19 test positivity cases low and learn to live with the virus, and continue to focus on public health through Manitoba’s COVID-19 Risk and Response System, and a focus on public health fundamentals.   	• Manitoba will grow its way out of this economic challenge and take action to ensure the province is in a stronger place after COVID-19 passes. Manitobans share a collective role in growing the economy. The campaign will build confidence and awareness of public health measures and employment support programs.   	    	“The past four months since COVID-19 arrived in Manitoba have been a period of rapid response and adaptation for programs and for public engagement,” said Pallister. “We have done well and accomplished much, adapting as we go and working rapidly to respond. Now, we are focusing our message on the importance of public health fundamentals as we drive to recovery.”   	    	Since mid-March, more than 2.7 million unique users visited the provincial website www.manitoba.ca 7.5 million times and viewed 13.7 million pages of content. In an effort to simplify the province’s catalogue of programs and brands for Manitobans to navigate, the province has reframed www.manitoba.ca to ensure programs are clearly presented and improve user experience.   	    	The campaign will solicit feedback through the http://EngageMB.ca portal and drive business participation and awareness of government programs. It will continue to encourage Manitobans to contact the Manitoba Economic Support Centre to access programs and resources, and the centre will promote program priorities in the coming weeks. To date, the centre has called more than 20,000 businesses a week to promote programs such as wage subsidies and the Manitoba Gap Protection Program.    	    	The government has commenced a paid advertising campaign on radio and billboards, with plans to expand to print and digital ads throughout the province. The campaign, which will be fully costed in the months ahead, will include Ready. Safe. Grow. materials and public health messages.   	    	To learn more about the campaign and programs available to Manitobans, visit:  www.manitoba.ca/restartmb.   	    	- 30 -  "

Richardson International Airport, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires and Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.   	    	“This is an important and long-overdue step forward for Manitoba’s largest airport and the area surrounding it,” said Squires. “The plan’s noise exposure forecast map, and the policies surrounding it, have not been updated for more than 25 years. The review of existing land-use policies, along with an updated noise exposure study, will ensure the Airport Vicinity Protection Area will appropriately reflect current conditions and noise thresholds in order to accommodate increased economic activity in the area while protecting the airport’s 24 hour operations.”    	    	“We are reducing barriers to development and economic growth by ensuring that information for decision making is current, while reducing planning approval and permitting delays and protecting the airport’s 24 hour operations,” said Eichler. “Up-to-date, scientific data on noise in the vicinity of the airport is crucial to help guide decisions on the type and scale of development that can occur in the area while fostering the airport’s continued growth.”    	    	The request for proposals (RFP) will engage external experts to complete a study that will recommend updates and changes to the Airport Vicinity Protection Area Secondary Plan (AVPA), enacted in 1994. This City of Winnipeg plan is a land-use document that aims to mitigate potential land-use conflicts associated with noise and other impacts generated by airport operations.    	    	“WAA commends the Province of Manitoba for showing leadership and moving forward with a review of the AVPA,” said Barry Rempel, president and CEO, Winnipeg Airports Authority (WAA). “This review is an opportunity to chart a new course for our province that sees optimal use of existing infrastructure for further residential and mixed-use development while protecting the community’s air connectivity, all founded on best practice and the latest scientific evidence.”   	    	The noise exposure forecast is the official measurement used in Canada for aircraft noise assessment. Transport Canada considers residential development incompatible with airport operations in areas that exceed specific noise thresholds.   	    	The RFP has been posted to MERX at www.merx.com under an open tendering process.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

We are not reducing funding for child care in Manitoba – in fact, we continue to make significant investments in child care including nearly $70 million since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. These investments have helped ensure that 914 child-care facilities are now open across the province, offering over 22,000 spaces. In fact, the supply of child care has now exceeded demand as we reopen – there are now over 3,500 vacant child-care spaces in Manitoba.   	    	This summer, the Manitoba government posted amendments to The Child Care Regulation that reflect changes contained in The Community Child Care Standards Amendment Act (Enhanced Powers Respecting Governance and Accountability) that was passed by the legislative assembly in 2018. As part of the development of this legislation and its regulations, the Manitoba government consulted widely with the child-care sector including with the Manitoba Child Care Association and the Child Care Coalition of Manitoba.    	    	What we heard from stakeholders was the need to streamline regulatory requirements so that child-care providers can focus on what matters most – providing accessible, quality early learning and child care for Manitoba families. That is why these regulations simplify the licensing process, reduce duplication in codes of conduct, and improve financial and board governance accountability for child-care providers across our province. Despite false claims by the opposition parties, the regulations also strengthen supports for children with exceptional additional support needs, ensuring that all licensed child-care providers develop written inclusion policies and inclusive programming for the children that they support.   	    	It is also clear the current enhanced nursery school grants established by the former administration are not working for Manitoba families, which is why these regulations provide the legal foundation for change. The current system creates two tiers of nursery schools in Manitoba – those that receive enhanced operating grants and charge reduced fees, and those that do not. There is no difference in the services provided between these two tiers and there is no income test for parents accessing child care at reduced fees. The regulatory changes reflect our intention to move toward a fair funding model that better supports all nursery school programs in Manitoba so that we give families equal access to child care. We are not making these changes immediately and when we do, parents and children across our province will be better served by our child-care system.   	    	The opposition parties continue to take an ideological approach to child care. In contrast, the Manitoba government continues to invest in choice in child care, which is why we have launched a funding model review to ensure that Manitoba families have access to the child care that they need regardless of whether that care is delivered by a non-profit, private or home-based provider. The review of the enhanced nursery school grants is part of that critical work.    	    	The Manitoba government also recognizes that child care is critical to our economic recovery, and that those who work in the sector are truly heroes helping heroes, which is why we have invested in over 25,000 individual personal protective equipment items to help them stay safe. Many child-care staff are also eligible for the $120-million Manitoba Risk Recognition Program, which is providing a one-time payment of $1,377 to more than 78,000 essential front-line workers who have taken extraordinary risks to keep Manitobans safe.    	    	In contrast with the fearmongering of the opposition parties, the Manitoba government will continue to support the child-care sector and Manitoba families as we safely restart our economy.”   	    	- 30 -  "

That’s why our government is taking every precaution to help keep Manitobans safe,” said Friesen. “By doubling our order of high-dose influenza vaccine and making it available to more people at high risk of contracting the flu, we are able to protect them, as well as our health-care providers on the front line.”   	    	The high-dose influenza vaccine is an immunization formulated for people age 65 years and older. Manitoba was the first province to offer to that age group and those living in long-term care facilities, clients in interim or transitional care beds, respite care clients or unimmunized residents admitted to a long-term care homes during the flu season.    	    	This year, the Manitoba government is expanding criteria for the vaccine to allow more seniors to get the high-dose influenza vaccine starting this fall including:   	• residents of supportive and assisted living housing;   	• those who are newly incarcerated or transferred from other federal or out-of-province correctional facilities;   	• those receiving home care services while on a waiting list for admission into a long-term care facility;   	• living on a First Nation or remote communities; and   	• living north of the 53rd parallel of latitude.   	    	In 2017, Manitoba became the first province to offer a high-dose version of the flu vaccine and many provinces have followed suit since then. Last year, Manitoba ordered 11,500 high-dose influenza vaccines and for the 2020-21 influenza season, the province will order up to 21,500 high-dose vaccine.    	    	In 2019-20, over 26.3 per cent of all Manitobans received the flu vaccine, the highest ever, and demand is expected to increase this year, the minister noted. During the 2019-20 flu season, 29 Manitobans died from the flu.    	    	Starting Aug. 17, pharmacies, physicians and other providers can start placing their influenza vaccine orders, with the vaccine expected to start arriving  late September.   	    	“Manitobans need to plan for a challenging flu season as COVID-19, influenza and colds will be occurring at the same time this fall,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “Getting the flu vaccine or the high-dose influenza vaccine is an important step that will help keep you and those around you healthy this season. Staying home when you are sick, practising good hand hygiene and covering your cough also helps reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others.”   	    	Visit Manitoba’s seasonal influenza website at www.manitoba.ca/flu or contact Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 in Winnipeg or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for more information.    	    	- 30 -  "

Manitoba was the first province to offer to that age group and those living in long-term care facilities, clients in interim or transitional care beds, respite care clients or unimmunized residents admitted to a long-term care homes during the flu season.    	    	This year, the Manitoba government is expanding criteria for the vaccine to allow more seniors to get the high-dose influenza vaccine starting this fall including:   	• residents of supportive and assisted living housing;   	• those who are newly incarcerated or transferred from other federal or out-of-province correctional facilities;   	• those receiving home care services while on a waiting list for admission into a long-term care facility;   	• living on a First Nation or remote communities; and   	• living north of the 53rd parallel of latitude.   	    	In 2017, Manitoba became the first province to offer a high-dose version of the flu vaccine and many provinces have followed suit since then. Last year, Manitoba ordered 11,500 high-dose influenza vaccines and for the 2020-21 influenza season, the province will order up to 21,500 high-dose vaccine.    	    	In 2019-20, over 26.3 per cent of all Manitobans received the flu vaccine, the highest ever, and demand is expected to increase this year, the minister noted. During the 2019-20 flu season, 29 Manitobans died from the flu.    	    	Starting Aug. 17, pharmacies, physicians and other providers can start placing their influenza vaccine orders, with the vaccine expected to start arriving  late September.   	    	“Manitobans need to plan for a challenging flu season as COVID-19, influenza and colds will be occurring at the same time this fall,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “Getting the flu vaccine or the high-dose influenza vaccine is an important step that will help keep you and those around you healthy this season. Staying home when you are sick, practising good hand hygiene and covering your cough also helps reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others.”   	    	Visit Manitoba’s seasonal influenza website at www.manitoba.ca/flu or contact Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 in Winnipeg or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for more information.    	    	- 30 -  "

I am pleased that over 60 per cent of Manitobans who lost employment due to COVID-19 are already back at work.”    	    	Following feedback from Manitobans and guided by public health advice, the province carefully moved forward with phase four of Restoring Safe Services:  Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap on July 23, the premier noted.   	    	New labour force statistics show Manitoba continues to build on the success of the last three months in returning nearly two-thirds of Manitobans back to work. Total July employment in Manitoba increased by 12,400, a two per cent increase from June, where employment increased by a record 28,900.    	    	In Manitoba, full-time employment was up 6,200, a 1.3 per cent increase, over double the national average. Part-time employment increased by 6,100, an increase of five per cent.   	    	Overall, the provincial unemployment rate edged down to 8.2 per cent, the lowest in the country. The private sector, which includes the self-employed, increased 8,600, a 1.9 per cent gain from June to July.    	    	Education services, and accommodation and food services saw the largest level changes in the same time period. Manitoba continues to lead the nation in youth employment.    	    	“We have led the country with some of the most generous support programs to help Manitobans navigate and bounce back from this challenging time,” said Pallister. “From the beginning, we have targeted our COVID programs with a focus on getting Manitobans back to work and back up on their feet.”   	    	As an additional support for Manitoba businesses, the government also announced today that it will be extending the Manitoba Gap Protection Program deadline for applications to Oct. 31 from Aug. 31. Businesses that are ineligible for federal support can also apply for an immediate $6,000 under this program, which has already provided more than $51 million in support to over 8,500 Manitoba businesses to help them restart their operations.    	    	To date, the Manitoba Back to Work This Summer Program has provided nearly $10 million in supports so more than 650 private-sector employers could hire and rehire 1,955 employees. The Summer Student Job Recovery Program has encouraged more than 2,200 employers to apply for over $23 million in wage subsidies for more than 4,700 student positions. The Back to Work Manitoba program has received over 260 applications from employers for nearly 1,600 positions and over $7 million in supports.    	    	Close to 4,500 individuals have applied for the Manitoba Job Restart Program for a total of nearly $9 million in financial support to return to work and voluntarily stop collecting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) or the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB).    	    	The Manitoba Bureau of Statistics will publish its full July 2020 Labour Force Survey bulletin later today at www.gov.mb.ca/mbs/moreinfo.html?id=3.    	    	- 30 -   	   "

Without appropriate interventions, this anxiety and distress can also affect a student’s short-term and long-term mental health.    	     	RIS is an evidence-based program for adults interacting with students in a school environment. Created by Respect Group Inc., the program helps to heighten adults’ awareness of the distress and harm that students might experience from a variety of sources, and equips them with knowledge and skills to make timely and appropriate interventions.    	    	“The pandemic has had far-reaching impacts on Manitobans of all ages,” said Goertzen. “The renewal of the Respect in School program is one more way we are enhancing the classroom experience for students.”   	    	In addition to the renewal, the government is extending the funding for RIS to the early learning and child-care sector for Manitoba educators and assistants working at licensed centres and homes. Early childhood educators are uniquely positioned to keep children safe, and they will now have access to an additional resource that helps support and protect children.    	    	“It is critical for adults in the education and child-care systems to be aware of and understand the distress that children and youth can be subjected to on a daily basis, and for them to be able and prepared to intervene as early as possible and help whenever necessary,” said Sheldon Kennedy, co-founder of Respect Group Inc. “I am pleased to see the Manitoba government take another step with this program for the benefit of young people across the province.”   	    	- 30 -   	   "

This will replace the dirt service road in the area that is not built to handle heavy truck traffic or withstand extreme weather conditions.   	    	Vehicles will use a traffic signal controlled intersection at the South Perimeter and Waverley Street to access Brady Road. Approximately 1,600 vehicles use the South Perimeter Highway daily to access the City of Winnipeg’s Brady Road Resource Management Facility. The minister noted the upgraded service road is scheduled to be completed by November 2020, which will allow the province to close the Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 100 turn-off onto Brady Road.     	    	The minister announced the province is naming the new service road Ethan Boyer Way to honour a 19-year-old who was killed in a collision on the perimeter at Brady Road on Oct. 25, 2019.   	    	“On behalf of the Zuk and Boyer family, we would like to thank the Manitoba government and Minister Ron Schuler for naming the new access road in Ethan’s memory. Our family and all his friends are honoured to have Ethan’s memory live on forever,” said the Zuk and Boyer families. “There is solace in knowing no other families will lose a loved one at that intersection and have to feel the hardship and heartache we feel each and every day. As Dr. Seuss said, ‘You never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory’.”   	    	Last November, the province implemented a speed reduction to 80 km/h from 100 km/h surrounding the intersection to address immediate safety concerns.   	    	The province is in the midst of a three-year South Perimeter Highway Safety Plan, launched in October 2018. The action plan includes proposed changes to median openings and access at 24 intersections, and service road improvements such as the safer connection of Brady Road to PTH 100. In summer 2019, the province blocked access from Brady Road, north to the Perimeter Highway in order to reduce the number of entry points to the highway.   	    	The province is also finalizing its long-term South Perimeter Highway Design Study with a goal to reconstruct PTH 100 to a freeway standard with no at-grade crossings between the Portage Avenue and Fermor Avenue interchanges.    	    	“We continue to look for ways to improve safety as well as traffic flow along the South Perimeter,” said Schuler. “We will examine locations that see a high frequency of collisions on an ongoing basis to further improve safety.”   	    	The province held public consultations and expects to release the South Perimeter Highway Design Study this summer, the minister noted.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

For the past two years, producer feedback has suggested that existing programming is not effective for some sectors, leading to federal and provincial governments to explore changes.   	    	Manitoba’s agriculture industry continues to be export driven. The province wants to ensure that producers and processors have continued access to current and new market opportunities.    	    	Innovation is becoming increasingly ingrained into the agriculture and agri-food sector. Technology has the capacity to prepare for and mitigate risk, address labour shortages, improve animal health and welfare and build increased sustainability into the sector. Input from the public will help shape Manitoba’s capacity through the use of Ag Action Manitoba programs.    	    	COVID-19 has impacted all Manitobans as well as food supply chains. Public input will help ensure the sector continues to be resilient in the face of future disruptions and crisis.    	    	This engagement complements an in-person, week-long tour by the minister that included multiple stops in rural Manitoba in an open dialogue format.    	    	To take part in the online engagement, visit https://engagemb.ca/engaging-mb-ag-industry.   	    	The online public engagement will close Tuesday, Sept. 1.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

The credit is available to Manitobans aged 65 and older who file an income tax return as a Manitoba resident.   	    	In May and June, Manitoba Finance mailed an advance payment of $200 to seniors who filed a 2018 income tax return. The province issued 226,037 cheques and to date, Manitobans have cashed 214,436 cheques, which amounts to a 95 per cent program success rate and a provincial investment of $42.9 million.   	    	“Overall, people aged 65 years and older and those with underlying illnesses are at higher risk for severe outcomes as a result of COVID-19 infection. We’d like to thank senior Manitobans for the additional hardships they’ve faced and adjustments they’ve made during this stressful time since the pandemic struck our province in March,” said Fielding.   	    	Seniors who changed mailing addresses since their 2018 tax filings were able to update their address online at www.manitoba.ca/seniorseconomicrecoverycredit. More than 12,000 Manitobans changed their address online to receive a cheque. Due to a coding error, 74 cheques required a reprint and the minister thanked those recipients for their patience and understanding.    	    	Seniors who did not receive a cheque in the mail can claim the $200 Seniors Economic Recovery Credit on their 2020 income tax return. The credit is not considered taxable income.   	    	Manitobans who require further assistance with the Seniors Economic Recovery Credit can contact 204-945-3744 or 1-866-626-4862 (toll-free) or email mgi@gov.mb.ca.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

Manitoba school divisions and schools will follow these provincial guidelines to finalize and post division plans by mid-August. Accessible and transparent information is important as students, staff and families will have questions about COVID-19 and returning to in-class learning.    	    	Learning in classrooms will be full-time for students in kindergarten through Grade 8 and for special-needs students in all grades, with five days of instruction per week. Some remote learning may be required for students in grades 9 to 12, based on the ability of high schools to implement necessary public health measures including physical distancing and the use of cohorts (designated groups of students) to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission, and to support contact tracing.    	    	Three response levels have been developed to ensure that school divisions and schools are prepared to roll back from in-class learning based on public health advice. Divisions must ensure that all students learning remotely have access to technology.   	    	“Manitoba Education and Public Health are working with divisions and individual schools to ensure that as many students as possible return to classroom learning full-time,” said Goertzen. “Divisions have been working diligently this summer on their individual plans for September, and are refining details for communication, screening, hand hygiene, physical distancing, the use of cohorts and outbreak management to be followed at every one of their schools.”    	    	A total of $48 million in savings is available to ensure that schools are COVID-ready in September, the minister noted, adding the province is monitoring resource implications closely as part of its planning to ensure the safe return to classroom instruction in the upcoming school year.    	    	“The need for child care is top of mind. The departments of Education and Families are working with school divisions and the child-care sector to ensure that families can continue to access child care within schools,” said Goertzen. “Both departments are working together to develop learning guidelines for children with special needs, as well as students at risk.”   	   Welcoming Our Students Back: Restoring Safe Schools is based on feedback provided by parents, caregivers, students and education stakeholders through an EngageMB survey that began in June. The minister noted tens of thousands of Manitobans have completed the survey, and the government will continue to collect and use this information in adapting plans while the public health situation evolves. Manitobans can visit https://engagemb.ca to share thoughts or ask questions.   	    	In a joint statement, the Manitoba School Boards Association, the Manitoba Teachers’ Society, Manitoba Federation of Independent Schools, Manitoba Association of School Business Officials and the Manitoba Association of School Superintendents said, “We believe that collaborative planning is in the best interests of students, parents, and school staff. The goal is to have as many students as possible learning in classrooms this fall and throughout the coming school year. Maintaining a strong focus on the health, safety and well-being of students, staff, families and communities, we all agree the emphasis needs to be on getting students the in-person teaching and learning they need while making sure that safety is the top priority for everyone.”    	    	For up-to-date information on COVID-19 in Manitoba, visit www.manitoba.ca/COVID19.   	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:   https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

""The results from across the province are impressive, and these enforcement efforts are making a difference in our communities,"" said Cullen.  ""The RCMP's specialized teams focus on chronic offenders and drug dealers who threaten the safety and well-being of everyone in our province. This investment is one important component of our government's overall plan to reduce crime and help ensure Manitobans feel safe in our communities.""  The crime reduction enforcement support teams have been involved in dozens of investigations, which have led to criminal charges against 43 people and the seizure of more than $76,000 and 46 firearms. More than 20 stolen vehicles have been recovered and, wherever possible, returned to their owners. Illicit drugs, primarily cocaine and methamphetamine, have also been seized and destroyed.   The province's investment in the crime reduction and enforcement teams was announced in November 2019.  It added two new officers to the existing team in the north, and created two new teams in the RCMP's eastern and western districts.  ""The RCMP Crime Reduction Enforcement Support Teams are based in strategic locations across Manitoba and work closely with intelligence analysts to determine who and what specific areas they should target to reduce criminal activity,"" said Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy, Commanding Officer for the Manitoba RCMP. ""We are pleased to see that these teams are already having a significant impact on rural crime and have no doubt that they will continue to do so in the months and years to come."" This initiative builds on the Policing and Public Safety Strategy released in May 2019 and is funded as part of Manitoba's Safer Streets, Safer Lives Action Plan. This action plan addresses escalating addiction and crime rates across the province through treatment, education and enforcement initiatives. Enforcement initiatives include:   a Crime Stoppers campaign in Winnipeg, Brandon and rural Manitoba and providing more cash for drug tips;  tactical enforcement efforts by the Winnipeg Police Service to respond to drug intelligence; more resources for the province's Public Safety Investigations Unit; connections between RCMP and municipal police forces and supporting joint forces operations to crack down on crime; civil forfeiture changes to turn seized drug money and assets into resources for police; and community networks where government and non-government organizations coordinate local crime prevention efforts.    The RCMP is Manitoba's provincial police service of record.  It serves about 580 communities and are responsible for policing over 90 per cent of the land in the province, covering more than 465,000 square kilometres.  It currently has nearly 1,000 sworn police officers and nearly 500 civilian employees. - 30 -  "

Under certain circumstances, Crown lands can be made available for agricultural use. The Agricultural Crown Lands Leasing program will administer the use of available land and provide necessary permits. Livestock must be removed when the naturally existing forage is exhausted or by Oct. 31 and baled hay must be removed by Nov. 15.   	If producers with AgriInsurance contracts intend to put their crop to alternate use (i.e. for feed), they are required to contact Manitoba Agricultural Services Corporation to arrange for a field appraisal before  harvesting the crop. Crop producers should also consider making crop residue available to livestock producers.

It will focus on:  	•    overall economic return on investment of the province’s $2.5 million commitment, through tax revenues, direct and indirect economic impact and social indicators;  	•    building and fostering community engagement, spirit and support; and  	•    providing community oversight and support to the CFL and the WFC to facilitate the effective delivery of the 60-game CFL season.             	The volunteer committee will be chaired by Brock Bulbuck, executive chair of Boyd Group Services Inc. Other members are:  	•    David Asper, Q.C., acting dean of the Faculty of Law, University of Manitoba;  	•    Barb Gamey, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Payworks, Inc.;  	•    Obby Khan, founder and CEO of Shawarma Khan restaurants and former Winnipeg Blue Bombers offensive linesman;  	•    Dr. Peter MacDonald, orthopedic surgeon;  	•    James Murphy, community and youth liaison, Manitoba Construction Sector Council, and former Winnipeg Blue Bombers wide receiver;  	•    Jennefer Nepinak, associate vice president of Indigenous Engagement, University of Winnipeg;  	•    Hannah Pratt, founder and freelance consultant, Hannah Rose PR;  	•    Paul Robson, former general manager of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and former chair of the CFL; and  	•    George Sigurdson, founder and president of Sigurdson Financial Group Inc.   	The committee will also include ex-officio members Philip Houde, CEO of the Manitoba Economic Development Office and Secretary to the Economic Growth Committee of Cabinet; Colin Ferguson, president and CEO of Travel Manitoba; and Dayna Spiring, president and CEO of Economic Development Winnipeg and chair of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers board of directors.   	“We are excited for the return of CFL football to our city and the opportunity to support the shortened season and boost community pride,” said Cox.  “The games will have a different look and feel without fans in the stands, but our priority is the health and safety of all Manitobans and all event participants, so we can continue to be one of Canada’s safest jurisdictions.”   	All plans and strategies will consider the health and safety of all Manitobans and visitors, including CFL personnel and players, and require Public Health approval on all related elements. The committee will not be responsible for developing public health and safety protocols, which will continue to be created and enforced by public health officials.   	“Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living has worked closely with the CFL to ensure that the health and safety of Manitobans comes first,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Chief Provincial Public Health Officer. “We will continue to do so when the season starts, to ensure that the appropriate steps are being taken so everyone involved is safe as we learn to live with this virus.”   	Everyone associated with the tightly-controlled hub city environment will be expected to follow all public health protocols at all times. International players will be required to isolate for 14 days at home before arriving in Winnipeg and seven days upon arrival. The general public will not be allowed inside dedicated CFL host hotels or IG Field. Only players, staff, league officials and media can enter the stadium. Violations will result in strict penalties, which could include players being sent home for the remainder of the season.   	Earlier this week, the province announced the creation of an $8 million #RestartMB Event Attraction Strategy to maximize the potential of Winnipeg and rural destinations to host large-scale meetings, conventions and events. The strategy will carefully balance public health considerations with ongoing efforts to restart the Manitoba economy.   	Of that fund, the province has earmarked $2.5 million to facilitate the CFL hub city event, which would offset eligible event-specific league expenses such as food and accommodations, practice field rentals and group transportation. The investment by the province was a required component of the bid to have Winnipeg selected as the hub city.   	Should the abbreviated 15-week season proceed, Winnipeg would serve as the backdrop for 60 football games televised across Canada and the 108th Grey Cup Championship. The hub city event would bring an estimated 800 participants to Winnipeg and generate $45 million in business sales, $4.5 million in direct tax and approximately $4 million in hotel stays, as well as support 600 jobs.

Our government appreciates the efforts of the hard-working and dedicated volunteers who help strengthen our communities.""   	The Citizens on Patrol Program (COPP) is receiving a $110,000 grant from the province. It is a community-based crime prevention initiative in which volunteers help deter crime by serving as additional eyes and ears for their communities and local law enforcement. The funds will be used to purchase safety items such as high visibility vests and other items to support the program.   	“This funding will allow us to support communities who want to have this program in place, by supplying vital patrol equipment, training resources, and community crime prevention signage,” said Detlef Hindemith, chairperson, Manitoba Citizens on Patrol Program. “We currently have 55 groups with more than 500 members that help maintain and create safer neighbourhoods. The program is a proven crime prevention strategy, utilizing trained citizens to watch for suspicious criminal activities, documenting and reporting to law enforcement, and by being a visible presence in the community.”   	The province is also providing an additional $48,000 to Crime Stoppers to support youth programming, advertising and incentives for tipsters. Crime Stoppers pays cash rewards for information that leads to the solution of crimes, and is a combined effort of the police, media and the public.  Funding will be divided between Winnipeg and Brandon at $25,000 and $11,000 respectively, with the remaining funding going to efforts in the rest of the province.   	“As we are a non-profit, volunteer-based program, we greatly appreciate the relationship we have with the province and are thankful for the funding provided,” said Rick Thomson, chair, Brandon Crime Stoppers. “This funding allows us to be more visible in the community and to provide information to various school programs.  We believe any tip is a good tip and keeping the community safe is our goal.”   	In Manitoba, cash and proceeds from the sale of forfeited property are deposited into the Criminal Property Forfeiture (CPF) Fund, which is used to:  	•    compensate victims of the unlawful activity that led to the forfeiture of the property;  	•    provide funding to the Victims’ Assistance Fund;  	•    promote safer communities by investing in specialized equipment/training for law enforcement agencies; and  	•    promote safer communities by providing funding to law enforcement agencies for community initiatives.   	The province also maintains the FPOC fund, which is generated from forfeited proceeds of crime through the prosecution of federal offences in Manitoba. The monies received from Canada are then re-allocated to activities related to crime prevention, including victim services, law enforcement and community initiatives such as drug prevention education.   	Since 2011, more than $16 million has been distributed to law enforcement agencies and community initiatives through the CPF fund, which includes the FPOC and Victims’ Assistance funds.     	For more information about criminal property forfeiture, visit: www.gov.mb.ca/justice/commsafe/cpf/index.html .   	- 30 -  "

I want to thank Manitobans for their valuable input and commitment to keep the virus at bay as we continue to take a balanced and measured approach at restarting our economy.”   	    	Over the last two days, more than 50,000 Manitobans provided feedback on the draft phase four plan through the online survey and telephone town hall, the minister noted.    	    	The draft plan proposed a number of changes to be implemented as early as July 25. As a result of public health evidence and advice and in response to feedback received, phase four will proceed but with some items deferred to a later date or moved forward with more limited implementation, while other steps will remain as proposed.   	    	The proposed changes to visits in personal care homes and long-term care settings will proceed as outlined in the draft document. The minister noted facility operators will continue to review visitation policies and processes to ensure appropriate visitation, along with the health and safety of residents and families.   	    	Items moving forward with more limited implementation on July 25 include:    		maintaining current site capacity at 30 per cent for faith-based services, pow wows, but eliminating the need for sub-groups (cohorts);   		allowing stage performances and opening movie theatres to a maximum capacity of 30 per cent of the site, up to a maximum of 500 people;   		allowing casinos to open at a maximum of 30 per cent of the site’s capacity; and   		allowing retail businesses and indoor recreation sites to use non-permeable barriers when distances of two metres can not be maintained.    	The following proposed changes have been deferred at this time:    		proposed changes to indoor and outdoor gathering sizes;   		relaxing of self-isolation requirements for those travelling from eastern and southern Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada; and   		walk-up counter service in bars, beverage rooms, brew pubs, microbreweries and distilleries.    	Public health officials will review possible adjustments on a week-by-week basis and make any additional changes based on the public health situation at the time.   	    	“It is thanks to the work and dedication of Manitobans that we have kept our test positivity rates low and reduced the level of illness from COVID-19 in Manitoba,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “We will continue to look to the data and engage with Manitobans to ensure we are taking a balanced approach as we learn how we can live with this virus in the weeks, months and years ahead.”   	    	To view the updated phase four plan and to review public health guidance for businesses, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19/restoring/index.html.    	    	Public health officials continue to encourage businesses to take steps to help staff, customers and visitors stay safe including:    		ensuring people are able to reasonably maintain two metres of distance;   		only conducting necessary and brief exchanges within two metres of others;   		applying enhanced cleaning protocols, especially in common areas like washrooms;   		maintaining physical distancing and food-handling protocols in workplace areas including lunch and common areas;   		ensuring staff stay home when feeling sick; and   		following personal risk reduction measures.    	#RestartMB is the Manitoba government’s roadmap to recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This sonar will increase the safety of divers. It is also used to located submerged vehicles and forensic evidence such as discarded weapons.     	“The Altona Police Service appreciates the continuing support of our service,” said Chief Perry Batchelor, Altona Police Service. “Radar devices must occasionally be upgraded in order for them to remain accurate and current. Road safety is an extremely important aspect of community policing. With these 15-year-old radar units now upgraded, our officers have renewed confidence enabling them to do their jobs even better.”   	    	HEART is a group of volunteer divers from the Oak Bluff Hutterite colony near Morris and one diver from Steinbach who specialize in drowning victim recoveries. In addition to assisting Manitoba communities, they have helped in recoveries in communities in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nunavut. The HEART team also works with the RCMP and Winnipeg Police Service Underwater Recovery Teams.   	    	In Manitoba, cash and proceeds from the sale of forfeited property are deposited into the Criminal Property Forfeiture (CPF) Fund, which is used to:     		compensate victims of the unlawful activity that led to the forfeiture of the property;   		provide funding to the Victims’ Assistance Fund;   		promote safer communities by investing in specialized equipment/training for law enforcement agencies; and   		promote safer communities by providing funding to law enforcement agencies for community initiatives.    	The province also maintains the Federal Proceeds of Crime Fund (FPOC), which is generated from forfeited proceeds of crime through the prosecution of federal offences in Manitoba. The monies received from Canada are then re-allocated to activities related to crime prevention including victim services, law enforcement and community initiatives such as drug prevention education.   	    	Since 2011, more than $16 million has been distributed to law enforcement agencies and community initiatives through the CPF fund, which includes the FPOC and Victims’ Assistance funds.    	    	For more information about criminal property forfeiture, visit: www.gov.mb.ca/justice/commsafe/cpf/index.html.   	    	- 30 -  "

Renovations to the fourth and fifth floors of the building will develop 18,400 square feet for the unit. Building upgrades will include heating, ventilation, lighting, asbestos removal, an upgraded nurse call system, new sprinklers and new elevators.   	    	Acute stroke care includes three categories of therapy including clot busting, clot removal and early intensive rehabilitation therapy. Clot busting is available in a number of hospitals throughout Manitoba, while clot removal is performed in specialized radiology suites at HSC Winnipeg.    	    	Establishing an acute stroke unit will allow patients in Manitoba to receive early intensive rehabilitation therapy, said Dr. Perry Gray, provincial lead, medical specialist services and chief medical officer for Shared Health.   	    	“Having an acute stroke unit in our province will allow stroke patients in Manitoba to receive the full range of therapies that are required to maximize their recovery,” said Gray. “This unit will enhance the quality of care stroke patients receive by preventing complications and recurrence, improving outcomes and speeding up recovery time.”   	    	When it opens, the acute stroke unit will be staffed by a trained team of inter-professional staff that includes stroke neurologists, psychiatrists and rehabilitation specialists. The unit will also benefit from its proximity to the development of new interventional angiography facilities and new equipment for HSC Winnipeg’s Diagnostic Centre of Excellence.    	    	“We’re so pleased to see the government of Manitoba’s continued commitment to the delivery of excellent stroke care for people in our province,” said Christine Houde, Manitoba director of government relations and health promotion, Heart and Stroke. “The new acute stroke unit will bring together a comprehensive team of stroke experts with the equipment they need to deliver first-class treatment and rehabilitation, leading to longer, more fulfilling lives for Manitobans who suffer a stroke, and their loved ones.”   	    	Today’s announcement is in addition to other stroke care investments including more than $487,000 toward operating and capital costs for the implementation of Telestroke.

Funding is being provided through the Growing Outcomes in Watersheds (GROW) Trust and the Conservation Trust.     	    	Through GROW, watershed districts in Manitoba will deliver 16 projects that improve resilience to the effects of climate change. Landowners will work with watershed districts and receive capital costs or annual payments to support new conservation projects. These include:    		$750,000 to the Seine Rat Roseau Watershed District in southeast Manitoba to support projects that reduce peak flows during floods, retain water during dry periods and capture nutrients in identified ‘hotspot’ areas that would otherwise end up in Lake Winnipeg;   		$440,000 for the Souris River Watershed District projects to reduce peak water flows, conserve at-risk shallow wetlands, improve soil health, conserve wildlife habitat and sequester carbon;   		$500,000 for the Inter-Mountain Watershed District, located east of the Riding and Duck mountains, to address flooding and severe water erosion that occurs along the edge of this region and the Manitoba escarpment; and   		$250,000 to the East Interlake Watershed District, on the west shore of Lake Winnipeg, to focus on wetland and riparian area enhancement projects that reduce water flow and capture nutrients before they can enter Lake Winnipeg.    	    	The Conservation Trust will also provide funding to four non-profit organizations that submitted watershed-based proposals. Examples of approved projects include:    		$150,000 for the Centre for Indigenous Environmental Resources to work within the Collaborative Leadership Initiative, involving Indigenous and municipal leaders to deliver wetland restoration projects and demonstrate water quality trading as a nutrient-reduction tool in the Lake Winnipeg basin; and   		$50,000 for Ducks Unlimited Canada to improve watershed resilience by restoring wetlands and other natural habitats in the prairie pothole landscape of southwest Manitoba.    	“Revenues from the trusts are now supporting new watershed conservation activities that also will help Manitobans adapt to the impacts of climate change,” said Tim Sopuck, chief executive officer, Manitoba Habitat Heritage Corporation.   	    	These GROW and Conservation Trust projects will also leverage more than $9 million in matching funds, the premier noted.    	    	The Conservation Trust was established in 2018 with a $102 million contribution to The Winnipeg Foundation to generate annual revenues for conservation projects in perpetuity. It is managed by the foundation, with projects approved, tracked and evaluated by the Manitoba Habitat Heritage Corporation. Earlier this year, 23 projects received $1.8 million in funding through the trust.  For more information, visit www.mhhc.mb.ca/the-conservation-trust/.     	    	In 2019, a $52-million endowment fund established GROW as a made-in-Manitoba approach to deliver ecological goods and services, with a focus on watershed health, management and resiliency.  In last fall’s speech from the throne, the province also committed to investing another $50 million in a Wetlands GROW Trust to support landowners who wish to conserve temporary wetlands not protected by regulation.   	    	GROW is delivered by Manitoba’s watershed districts through local watershed committees.

Proposed measures could be implemented as early as July 25 and those measures include:   	• increasing gathering sizes to 75 people indoors and 250 outdoors, where members of the public are reasonably able to maintain a separation of at least two metres from others, except for brief exchanges. Larger group sizes would be allowed where distinct groups of 75 or 250 can be separated to prevent contact with other groups.   	• increasing visitation at personal care and long-term care facilities, ensuring a balanced approach to visitation is required which mitigates the risk of COVID-19 transmission within sites. Each resident or designate would be able to identify two support people who would be able to visit the resident’s room indoors. Outdoor visits would be allowed for a reasonable number of visitors (up to four people) per resident, depending on availability of space. Each site will need to develop specific plans for enabling outdoor/indoor visitation by visitors to ensure the safety of residents within the facilities.   	• adjusting restrictions for faith-based gatherings, pow wows and other cultural and spiritual events, as well as resuming live theatrical performances and movie theatres. No cohorts will be required and capacity will increase to 50 per cent of the site’s capacity or 500 people, whichever is lower. Adequate physical distancing between individuals and households must continue to be provided.   	• opening casinos, with a maximum occupancy of 50 per cent of the site’s capacity. Physical distancing, and frequent and enhanced cleaning and wiping of surfaces are required.   	• lifting occupancy restrictions in all retail settings and indoor recreation sites except for gyms, fitness centres, martial arts, gymnastic clubs and yoga studios. These sites must remain at occupancy levels of 50 per cent or one person per 10 square metres, whichever is lower.   	• allowing closer distancing at therapeutic health businesses and personal service businesses such as hair and nail salons where a non-permeable barrier is installed.    	• allowing counter walk-up service in bars, beverage rooms and brew pubs provided non-permeable barriers and hand sanitizer is available for patrons, along with more frequent cleaning and wiping of surfaces.   	    	The province is also considering removing the 14-day, self-isolation travel restriction for domestic travel within Canada, the premier noted.    	    	“Manitoba is one of the safest places in the world to go back to work and get back up on your feet,” said Pallister. “We must maintain our vigilance while growing our way out of this pandemic. I encourage all Manitobans to have their say in our next steps of restarting our economy.”   	    	Manitobans are encouraged to fill out the survey at https://engagemb.ca and will also have the opportunity to participate in a telephone town hall tomorrow. Detailed information on the updates, including service restoration, measures the public can take to reduce their risk of COVIC-19 exposure or spreading the virus, and workplace guidance for businesses, can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/restoring/.   	    	Public health officials continue to encourage businesses to take steps to help staff, customers and visitors stay safe including:   	• ensuring people are able to reasonably maintain two metres of distance;   	• only conducting necessary and brief exchanges within two metres of others;   	• applying enhanced cleaning protocols, especially in common areas like washrooms;   	• maintaining physical distancing and food-handling protocols in workplace areas including lunch and common areas;   	• ensuring staff stay home when feeling sick; and   	• following personal risk reduction measures.   	    	#RestartMB is the Manitoba government’s roadmap to recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Manitoba processors have stepped up to deal with those challenges, just as Canadians have never been more appreciative of the importance of our food supply chain,” said Bibeau. “The funding our two governments are delivering together today gives Manitoba processors an extra financial boost to adjust to the challenges presented by COVID-19 and help keep their workers safe.”   	    	“A COVID-19 response for the agri-food and agri-product sector is needed to ensure processors can adapt, recover and maintain competitiveness,” said Pedersen. “The pandemic has required them to make changes to their operations and enhance their employee protections. Manitoba’s food and agri-product processors are significant contributors to our economy, so we are pleased to offer a program that helps respond to these challenges.”   	    	The new COVID-19 Response Initiative will provide financial assistance to agri-food and agri-product processors, food distributors and agri-food industry organizations for:   	• personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies;    	• business continuity practices, training and resources to support COVID-19 mitigation; and    	• beginning in September, financial assistance will also be available for materials, supplies and equipment rentals needed to adapt production processes to meet social distancing and other precautions related to COVID-19.   	    	Eligible costs must be directly related to the execution of a project and must be incurred between April 1, 2020, and Jan. 31, 2021. Projects must be completed on or before Jan. 31, 2021.   	    	Governments will contribute a maximum of 50 per cent of eligible project costs, up to $25,000 per applicant.   	    	Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s Emergency Processing Fund (EPF) is a federal investment of up to $77.5 million to help companies implement changes to safeguard the health and safety of workers and their families due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.   	    	The five-year, $3-billion Canadian Agricultural Partnership includes $2 billion for cost-shared strategic initiatives delivered by the provinces and territories and $1 billion for federal programs and services.

He added the provincial funding must be spent on eligible expenses, which include:   	• food and accommodations,   	• practice field rentals,   	• group transportation, and   	• event-specific expenses in Manitoba.   	    	The CFL has conducted extensive consultations with Public Health, and the CFL’s hub city plan for Winnipeg has been thoroughly reviewed by Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.   	    	“The health and safety of all Manitobans and all participants is paramount,” Roussin said. “CFL teams and anyone associated with the hub city will be expected to follow all protocols as reviewed by Public Health, at all times.”   	    	The premier noted the province’s investment of $2.5 million would result in substantial economic spinoffs if Winnipeg were named as the CFL hub city. A recent economic impact analysis estimates approximately 800 participants would result in the equivalent of 55,000 hotel room night stays, which would generate approximately $3.8 million for the provincial economy. It also estimates $45 million in business sales and $4.5 million in direct tax would be generated. Should Winnipeg win the full bid to serve as hub city, it would serve as the backdrop for 60 football games televised across Canada and the CFL has indicated the 108th Grey Cup game would be played in Winnipeg.   	    	“Sports, and particularly the CFL and our beloved ‘Blue and Gold’, is intertwined into Manitoba culture,” said Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox. “As a CFL hub city, we would be so proud to showcase our beautiful province, and from a safe distance, cheer on our Blue Bombers as they defend their 2019 Grey Cup championship title.”   	    	The premier noted Manitoba has a long and proud history of hosting major world-class events such as the Pan American Games, the IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship, FIFA Women's World Cup, the Canada Summer Games, Brier, the Juno Awards and numerous Grey Cup championships.   	    	The province is in the process of putting together an event committee that will work with the CFL and the Winnipeg Football Club to successfully serve as a hub city.   	    	At the conclusion of a CFL hub city event, the province would require a final report that details actual expenditures, the premier noted.   	    	- 30 -  "

The amount will continue to grow over time, creating guaranteed sustainability and growth for the museum in perpetuity.    	    	Additionally, the signature museums will have access to about $10,000 for training each year through the proceeds of a $200,000 Signature Museum Capacity Building Fund that will also be managed by The Winnipeg Foundation.   	    	“We are pleased to manage these funds to help ensure these valuable Manitoba institutions continue to offer world-class experiences for visitors to our province,” said Rick Frost, CEO of The Winnipeg Foundation.    	    	“We are grateful for this strategic investment and are happy to see the fund is targeting things like enhanced visitor experiences and access to professional development opportunities,” said Vania Gagnon, director, St. Boniface Museum. “This provides us with a new level of certainty, which will make it easier to plan and continue to serve our role as one of the province’s signature museums.”   	    	The signature museum program was established in 1998 and assists selected museums that have the potential to be significantly enhanced as heritage tourism attractions.

When police respond to a call and find a person in a mental health crisis, the tool helps them determine the most appropriate response based on their observations and an assessment of the potential risks.   	    	“The HealthIM tool ensures police are centered on the person in crisis and determining a pathway that best supports their needs,” said Deputy Chief Gord Perrier, Winnipeg Police Service. “Data accountability within the program provides real-time insight that assists in whole system alignment that improves outcomes and overall patient care.”       	    	Manitoba will be the first province in Canada to expand this mental health tool across the province.   	    	“Every day, our officers across Manitoba strive to make the communities they serve safer and to help those in need. In several communities, RCMP members have been utilizing HealthlM during encounters with individuals in crisis,” said Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy, commanding officer for the Manitoba RCMP. “HealthIM provides valuable insights to our members when they are attempting to de-escalate volatile situations. This additional funding will ensure that more of our officers will have access to HealthIM to help them better handle these difficult calls for service.”   	    	In lower-risk situations, the HealthIM assessment might allow the person to work with the officer to co-ordinate a referral to a local mental health agency, which would receive a copy of the officer’s assessment and then assign a worker to followup. In higher-risk situations, the tool will help officers determine an approach to safely reduce the likelihood the person will harm themselves or others. Officers will also be able to see if the person has had a prior mental health crisis involving a police response.    	    	HealthIM receivers have also been installed in local emergency rooms, nursing stations and community mental health agencies to support secure information sharing.    	    	“The Manitoba government’s renewed commitment to HealthIM will continue to ensure effective use of police and health resources across our jurisdictions,” said Chief Wayne Balcaen, Brandon Police Service. “As a result, individuals in mental health crisis are receiving the best treatment available, while officers are spending less wait time in hospitals.”   	    	The minister noted that this investment is on top of recent provincial investments in mental health and addictions supports. The initiatives address a number of recent recommendations made in the in the Virgo report and support recommendations made by other organizations such as the Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth, Tracia’s Trust and the Illicit Drug Task Force.   	    	To date, more than $39.8 million has been invested in 22 initiatives to improve mental health and addictions services throughout the province. These investments help ensure better outcomes for people in mental health crisis, manage the demands placed on police officers and ensure appropriate support is provided when and where it is needed, the minister noted.   	    	In all, the Manitoba government has committed more than $750,000 to ensure police officers across the province can access HealthIM.    	    	Between July 2019 and June 2020, Health IM was used 4,087 times, and in 28.5 per cent of cases, the person remained in the community and did not require hospitalization or other urgent interventions. In the same time period, Manitoba has seen a 57.5 per cent decrease in apprehension rates and a 68 per cent decrease in average hospital wait times. This ensures officers can spend more time in the community doing active police work, and less time transporting or waiting with individuals in hospital.   	    	HealthIM is an Ontario-based company, and its software and other tools have been used to help municipal police agencies respond more effectively in these types of situations since 2013.    	    	The minister noted today’s announcement was made possible through the Federal Proceeds of Crime Fund, maintained by Manitoba’s Criminal Property Forfeiture Branch. Manitoba allocates funds forfeited from federally prosecuted Criminal Code offences to activities related to crime prevention including victim services, law enforcement and community initiatives such as drug prevention education. More information about criminal property forfeiture is available at www.gov.mb.ca/justice/commsafe/cpf/disbursement.html.    	   Manitoba’s Policing and Public Safety Strategy, announced in May 2019, identified the need to reduce extraneous demands on police, recognizing mental health challenges are often better addressed by other professionals. This tool helps ensure that police better understand what mental health services an individual in crisis needs.   	   Manitoba’s Policing and Public Safety Strategy is available online at:  www.gov.mb.ca/justice/pubs/police_publicsafety_strategy.pdf.    	    	- 30 -  "

The total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba is now 331.    	    	Today’s case is a male in his 30s from the Southern Health–Santé Sud health region. The investigation is ongoing and any additional information will be provided as needed once investigations are complete to inform people of any public health risks.   	    	The data also shows:   	• no individuals are in hospital,   	• six active cases and 318 individuals have recovered from COVID-19, and   	• the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at seven.   	    	An additional 734 tests were completed on Wednesday, bringing the total number of tests performed since early February to 73,042.    	    	With summer in full swing now, it is important to remember to maintain physical distancing at the beach too. Standard physical distancing practices should be followed, including two metres or six feet of separation from other beach users outside a family group, and four metres or 12 feet of separation between each group’s towels and blankets on the beach to allow for foot traffic to and from the water. More information on guidelines for Manitoba beaches can be found at:  www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/provincial-park-beaches/index.html.   	    	Manitoba Parks has reinstated the life-jacket loaner program at 11 provincial parks. There will be some occasional cleaning efforts made, but after consulting with public health officials, it has been determined the risk of transmission would be relatively low and was balanced against the risk of drowning if someone needs a life jacket. Park visitors are still encouraged to bring their own life jackets if they are a non-swimmer.    	    	For up-to-date information on COVID-19 in Manitoba, visit www.manitoba.ca/COVID19.    	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:  https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

The study will guide the design of a roundabout to improve the safety and operational efficiency of the intersection.   	    	“We want to improve the safety for everyone on Manitoba roads and we’re exercising due diligence in considering permanent safety solutions,” said Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler. “We’ve identified the intersection of the Trans-Canada and Yellowhead highways as a priority project and our investment will make the intersection safer and more efficient, as well as create construction jobs for Manitobans to help our economy rebound.”   	    	The minister noted the study and design will be complete in October 2020.   	    	Schuler noted the province recently implemented interim safety measures at the intersection including additional pavement markings, installation of a dedicated turning lane, improved signage and traffic signal upgrades.    	    	Funding for the PTH 1 and PTH 16 intersection upgrades are part of the $500-million Manitoba Restart Program, an economic stimulus package to help restart Manitoba’s economy and ramp up construction in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The province has earmarked $65 million for major highway projects, including the PTH 1 and PTH 16 upgrades and recently announced PTH 100 and St. Mary’s Road interchange.    	    	#RestartMB is the Manitoba government’s roadmap to recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nightly camping fees and fees in national parks still apply.    	    	Provincial parks have seen a significant increase in visitation this year, with over 68,000 campsite reservations made this year to date, an increase of 13 per cent over 2019. Campground occupancy has increased eight and a half per cent compared to this time last year.   	    	Parks offer a full range of physical activities in the great outdoors. Hiking, swimming, canoeing and mountain biking are all part of a healthier lifestyle. When visiting parks, remember to practise physical distancing and wash or sanitize hands frequently to protect yourself from COVID-19.    	    	Other reminders when visiting parks include:   	• Practice ‘Leave No Trace’ – always pack out everything you packed in.   	• Keep dogs on leash and clean up after pets.   	• Avoid busy trails. If a trailhead parking lot is full, do not park along roadways. Visit another trail to minimize impacts on the landscape.   	• Be ‘Wildlife Smart’ by staying alert and secure attractants such as food, toiletries and trash. For more information on staying safe in black bear country, visit www.manitoba.ca/blackbear.   	    	Park interpreters are offering a range of summer programs while maintaining physical distancing for COVID-19. Look for posted event details in select parks for information on amphitheatre events and campfire talks.   	    	Manitobans are also reminded to stop the spread of invasive species to help protect provincial parks. Firewood cannot be moved out of the city of Winnipeg due to the presence of the emerald ash borer and the designation of Winnipeg as a federally regulated area.  Anyone caught transporting firewood could face fines or charges. Firewood should always be obtained and burned locally.   	    	The spread of zebra mussels and other AIS is preventable. All surface water users such as boaters, fishers, beach goers and floatplane operators are reminded to do their part when entering and exiting all water bodies in Manitoba. Specific decontamination and bait requirements are in place within AIS control zones. The AIS open-water season checklist is a step-by-step resource that can help surface water-users comply with the Manitoba government’s AIS regulation.   	    	Watercraft inspection stations are operating into the middle of fall. It is a legal requirement for all watercraft, which includes canoes, kayaks and jet skis, to stop at watercraft inspection stations when they are open. AIS requirements and set fines for offences are in effect year round.   	    	For more information on invasive species, including the decontamination station schedule for aquatic invasive species, visit www.manitoba.ca/StopAIS.   	    	Check park-related COVID-19 information before visiting or sign up for guided tours and look for local event details at www.manitobaparks.com.    	    	- 30 -   	   "

Changing CERB so returning workers can keep some of this benefit, rather than lose it all at once, would help both businesses and workers.”   	    	Manitoba recognized this disincentive early on and created the Manitoba Job Restart Program to provide direct payments of up to $2,000 in financial support to those Manitobans who voluntarily came off CERB and took full time work. Over 2,500 Manitobans have applied for the Manitoba Job Restart Program, with hundreds of new applications received daily, the premier noted.

Ensuring our food security, especially in our northern communities, is a cause that is close to my heart and a major preoccupation of our government - which is why we launched the Food Policy for Canada that is supporting local food initiatives in communities across the country.”    	    	“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused financial stress for a number of Manitobans, making access to healthy food more difficult,” said Pedersen. “Prior to the pandemic, many of Manitoba’s northern communities were already facing distribution and access problems. This project will increase food security and resiliency within Manitoba’s northern region.”   	    	Canada and Manitoba will be providing a total of $200,000 through the CAP to support innovative projects that directly increase northern food supply.

Grant funding to the Northern Healthy Food Initiative’s key strategic partners will be increased by $220,000 this year to reinforce existing food security programming in northern Manitoba. These partners include the Bayline Regional Roundtable, Four Arrows Regional Health Authority, Frontier School Division, Food Matters Manitoba and the Northern Association of Community Councils.    	    	“Needed now more than ever, strengthening food security in northern Manitoba helps build healthier communities,” said Manitoba Indigenous and Northern Relations Minister Eileen Clarke. “From greenhouses, gardens and poultry to beekeeping and traditional Indigenous food system projects, today’s funding will not only put food on the table today, but will build leadership, self confidence, and strengthen family and community connections for years to come.”    	    	The ministers noted these collective investments recognize and celebrate the efforts of northern communities and their partners who work tirelessly to strengthen northern Manitoba’s food system.     	    	For more information about the NMFCCC, www.nmfccc.ca/.  For more information about the Northern Healthy Foods Initiative, visit www.gov.mb.ca/inr/major-initiatives/nhfi/.    	    	The five-year, $3-billion Canadian Agricultural Partnership includes $2 billion for cost-shared strategic initiatives delivered by the provinces and territories and $1 billion for federal programs and services.

The provincial labour force increased by 23,600 people in June.   	    	Manitoba saw a significant 13.3 per cent increase in part-time jobs, up by 14,200. Full-time employment was up 14,800, a 3.1 per cent increase.    	    	Manitoba youth unemployment in particular decreased 3.5 percentage points to 19.3 per cent, the lowest in Canada. This reflects the focus the provincial government has placed on providing opportunities for students to find work.    	    	Overall, the provincial unemployment rate edged down to 10.1 per cent, the second lowest in the country and below Canada’s rate of 12.3 per cent.

It was expected they would move down the Nelson River naturally, so it was designated an aquatic invasive species (AIS) control zone in 2015 to help prevent the introduction and control the spread of zebra mussels and spiny waterflea.   	    	Adult and veliger zebra mussels were first detected in the Nelson River in August 2019. Last fall, department officials contacted nearby communities and stakeholders to inform them of the discovery of zebra mussels, mostly in the larval stage, in the region.     	    	Zebra mussels can impair community drinking water systems and other industries that use water from affected water bodies. They can contaminate watercraft motors and shorelines. Zebra mussels also negatively affect commercial fishers, lodge operators and local tourism.   	    	The spread of zebra mussels and other AIS is preventable. All surface water users such as boaters, fishers, beach goers and floatplane operators are reminded to do their part when entering and exiting all water bodies in Manitoba. Specific decontamination and bait requirements are in place within AIS control zones. The AIS open-water season checklist is a step-by-step resource that can help surface water-users comply with the Manitoba government’s AIS regulation.   	    	Watercraft inspection stations are operating into the middle of fall. It is a legal requirement for all watercraft, which includes canoes, kayaks and jet skis, to stop at watercraft inspection stations when they are open.

It was expected they would move down the Nelson River naturally, so it was designated an aquatic invasive species (AIS) control zone in 2015 to help prevent the introduction and control the spread of zebra mussels and spiny waterflea.   	    	Adult and veliger zebra mussels were first detected in the Nelson River in August 2019. Last fall, department officials contacted nearby communities and stakeholders to inform them of the discovery of zebra mussels, mostly in the larval stage, in the region.     	    	Zebra mussels can impair community drinking water systems and other industries that use water from affected water bodies. They can contaminate watercraft motors and shorelines. Zebra mussels also negatively affect commercial fishers, lodge operators and local tourism.   	    	The spread of zebra mussels and other AIS is preventable. All surface water users such as boaters, fishers, beach goers and floatplane operators are reminded to do their part when entering and exiting all water bodies in Manitoba. Specific decontamination and bait requirements are in place within AIS control zones. The AIS open-water season checklist is a step-by-step resource that can help surface water-users comply with the Manitoba government’s AIS regulation.   	    	Watercraft inspection stations are operating into the middle of fall. It is a legal requirement for all watercraft, which includes canoes, kayaks and jet skis, to stop at watercraft inspection stations when they are open. AIS requirements and set fines for offences are in effect year round.   	    	For more information on invasive species, including the decontamination station schedule for aquatic invasive species, visit www.manitoba.ca/StopAIS.   	    	- 30 -  "

Mathias Colomb Cree Nation, Granville Lake and Leaf Rapids residents should be prepared for high water.   	    	Saskatchewan Power is releasing record high flows from reservoirs along the Churchill River. The effects of this flow increase in Manitoba will be:   	• Pukatawagan Lake - Mathias Colomb Cree Nation  - Increased levels will be seen in three to five days, with peak levels in five to eight days.  At the peak, the level is expected to rise by five to seven feet.   	- The current lake level is 905.5 ft. and the peak forecast level is 910.5 to 912.5 ft.   	• Granville Lake   	- The increased release is expected in about two weeks, with the peak arriving within three to four weeks, rising by eight to 10 ft.    	- The current lake level is 859 ft. with the peak expected to be 867 to 869 ft.   	• Leaf Rapids   	- The increased release is expected in about two weeks, with the peak within three to four weeks.  At the peak, the level is expected to rise by eight to 10 ft.    	- The current lake level is 856.3 ft. with the peak level estimated at 864.3 to 866.3 ft.   	    	Areas of southwest and western Manitoba continue to experience flood conditions following record-high precipitation of more than 200 millimetres. Southern Manitoba, including the United States portion of the Red River basin, also received significant precipitation during this time. The precipitation has caused water levels to rise in rivers and creeks in these areas.   	    	Water levels at the provincial dam at Rivers on the Little Saskatchewan River have declined steadily as there has been no significant rain in the area. The levels are now closer to the 2014 high water event.    	    	The steady declines have allowed provincial crews to prepare material and equipment to start the process of assessing the condition of the dam at Rivers.    	    	The latest flow on the Little Saskatchewan River at Minnedosa is 1,540 cubic feet per second (cfs).     	    	The latest flow rate from the Rivers dam is approximately 3,900 cfs, receding from the 12,000 cfs peak flow observed July 1.   	    	The dams at Rivers and Minnedosa are being monitored around the clock.   	    	At present, 57 individuals remain evacuated from the RM of Riverdale, 17 remain evacuated from the RM of Whitehead while the town of Neepawa and the RM of Cornwallis evacuees have returned. In addition, livestock has been moved from the RMs of Riverdale and Whitehead.     	    	People are advised to stay away from areas experiencing flooding and to avoid entering flooded water bodies. Unless travel is necessary, the province requests that individuals stay away from affected areas.   	    	Manitoba Infrastructure crews are working in the flood-affected areas. Staff are monitoring water level conditions and inspecting infrastructure on an ongoing basis, and 11 standard emergency response trailers have been deployed to the Westman area. These trailers contain pumps, water tubes and other essential flood equipment.   	    	Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization staff are working with municipalities to support local emergency management efforts. If required, evacuee reception centres will have physical distancing measures in place.   	    	A high water advisory has been issued for the Red River between Emerson and Winnipeg.   	    	Water levels are rising on the Red River and its tributaries due to recent rain, but levels are expected to remain within banks.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

The minister noted results from three aerial surveys on moose population trends were also released today, as part of the government’s commitment to enhance the quality and transparency of big game population data for biologists and the public.   	    	“Fall hunting is an important annual activity for many Manitobans as they spend time in our province’s great outdoors,” said Pedersen. “We are pleased to be making hunting licences and other outdoor recreation licences and permits more accessible and convenient with the move to e-licensing.”   	    	Fall hunting licenses will be available in August on the new e-licensing system at www.manitobaelicensing.ca/licensing.page. Hunters should visit the site to set up their account, order game tags and purchase their license in advance of opening day, as they must allow two weeks for delivery of game tags. The site can also be used to search for vendors that sell licences.    	    	Print copies of the Manitoba Hunting Guide 2020 will start to become available at Manitoba Conservation and Climate offices and licence vendors in the coming weeks and the guide is now available at www.gov.mb.ca/sd/pubs/fish_wildlife/huntingguide.pdf.    	    	The province has made its 2020 aerial moose surveys available in a new, more user-friendly format. Aerial population surveys allow biologists to determine changes in population trend over time and evaluate changes in sex and age ratios. Aerial moose surveys were conducted in January and February in Game Hunting Areas (GHA) 13, 13A (Porcupine Mountain), 18, 18A-C (Duck Mountain) and 26 (Pinawa/Bisset area), and a summary of the recent results is available at http://gov.mb.ca/sd/pubs/fish_wildlife/hunting/2020biggame_results.pdf.   	    	“Moose populations appear to be recovering in certain areas. However, the slow recovery suggests they are facing an uphill battle,” said Pedersen. “By sharing this information, we want to help user groups better understand the demands on these resources and inform the potential measures that may be needed to help keep moose populations healthy.”   	    	The survey results suggest a gradual trend of increasing moose populations in Duck Mountain and GHA 26 since 2010 and a stable population in Porcupine Mountain. The trend over time suggests these populations are recovering, but more slowly than anticipated.   	    	Moose hunting closures have been in place in the areas surveyed. However, the results show hunting is only one of several factors affecting populations. Good nutrition and habitat have positive effects on moose survival and reproduction, while other factors such as disease, parasites, predation and the harvest of cows have negative effects.   	    	The minister noted the province is committed to implement shared management plans, based on listening, learning and working with stakeholders. This work will begin in partnership with user groups and communities later this year.    	    	- 30 -   	   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED   	   "

Some of the funds saved were used to cover new costs for improvements to technology for remote learning and the remaining savings will go toward adapting to reopening classrooms in September as well as for public health measures that may be in place.   	    	In addition, once fully implemented, more than $4 million per year will be redirected to classrooms after Manitoba school divisions identified this sum in annual savings as part of an executive management streamlining initiative across multiple public-sector organizations, Goertzen noted.    	    	The fiscal sustainability measures have involved executive compensation, management streamlining and staff efficiencies. School divisions were directed to reduce their executive and senior management complements by 15 per cent by Sept. 1.   	    	“This is good news for students and parents as it will mean more spent on improving classroom learning,” said Goertzen. “The government measures ensure fiscal sustainability will make a positive impact on Manitoba schools and the education of students across the province.”   	    	Medium-sized and large school divisions with more than four executive or senior management positions were expected to reduce their numbers of positions by 15 per cent, the minister said.

Private investment is used to fund the programs initially, and then is repaid if social outcomes and cost savings are realized. These types of programs allow the government to explore more innovative solutions without financial risk, with the ultimate goal of delivering better outcomes for Manitobans.   	    	In this case, the social impact bond is intended to reduce recidivism in youth between the ages of 12 to 18 who are currently involved with restorative justice, community supervision orders and/or are in custody. The resulting programming will use a holistic approach grounded in Indigenous traditions and knowledge, and will seek to include the youths’ natural and found families. The skills, education and mental health needs of youth will also be supported.    	    	The province will provide up to $460,000 for a site in Winnipeg and up to $230,000 for a site in Thompson for each of the three years of the project, inclusive of program and evaluation costs.    	    	The Manitoba government will select one or more service providers from among those that submit ideas and the successful proponent will work with the province to develop a business case to promote the project with potential investors.

In Turtle Mountain Provincial Park, 5,114 ha have changed from recreational development, resource management and access to back-country land-use category. This change will help the moose population recover, the minister noted.   	    	The increased protection afforded in the Turtle Mountain Provincial Park was made possible when Tundra Oil and Gas voluntarily ceased operations in the park and rehabilitated its lease sites.   	    	“The partnership Tundra Oil and Gas has with the Turtle Mountain Provincial Park is a strong example of collaborative land-use restoration under a sustainable resource use model,” said Jane Mactaggart, president and chief executive officer, Tundra Oil and Gas. “Following our voluntary contribution of legacy land leases, Tundra’s oil and gas operations have been reclaimed and restored with a blend of native grasslands. The team at Tundra joins with our fellow Manitobans to celebrate the land-use change of this permanently protected ecosystem.”   	    	Establishing new protected areas is a key goal of the nature pillar of the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan. Adding these lands to Manitoba’s network of protected and conserved areas has increased the area of the province set aside for biodiversity conservation to 11.1 per cent, the minister noted.   	    	- 30 -  "

Resurfacing work will take place on the following sections of highway:     		the Trans-Canada Highway eastbound lanes from Provincial Road (PR) 257 near Virden to the east junction at Oak Lake (29.5 km);   		the Trans-Canada Highway eastbound lanes from the east junction of PR 250 to the west junction of PTH 10 near Brandon (22.9 km);   		the Trans-Canada Highway eastbound lanes from the east junction of PTH 26 near St. François Xavier to Gaol Road near Headingley (six km);   		the Trans-Canada Highway westbound lanes from Gaol Road to the east junction of PTH 26 (six km);   		PTH 23 from PTH 59 to PTH 75 near Morris (29 km);   		PTH 23 from PTH 34 to PTH 5 west of Baldur (39.4 km);   		PTH 23 from PTH 5 to the west junction of PTH 18 near Ninette (25.3 km);   		PTH 23 from the west junction of PTH 18 to the south junction of PTH 10 near Minto (26.2 km);   		PTH 59 from the U.S. Border to PR 403 near St. Malo (40 km); and   		PTH 59 from PR 403 to PTH 52 (21 km).    	Some of the planned projects involve reconstruction, which includes grading or grade widening, removing the existing surface, restoring the road base and resurfacing multi-layered pavement. Work also includes major rehabilitation that involves a multi-layer pavement overlay to restore the pavement surface condition, extend pavement life and increase loading capacity. Other projects will involve single layer pavement overlays to improve pavement surface condition and extend pavement life.   	    	Schuler said the province expects to begin work on some of the roadways this August.   	    	“We have identified areas for reconstruction and major rehabilitation on three key highways in our province,” said Schuler. “We are making upgrades and performing maintenance on the Trans-Canada and highway 59 south, which are important routes for trade and tourism, and repairing damage on portions of highway 23 that occurred during the spring breakup to prevent further closures.”    	    	The road resurfacing funds come from the $500-million Manitoba Restart Program, an economic stimulus package announced in May to help restart Manitoba’s economy and ramp up construction as the province moves forward through the COVID-19 pandemic. The province will announce further projects funded under the Manitoba Restart Program in the coming weeks.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

We thank Manitobans for their patience during this time,” said Friesen. “This government is looking for innovative solutions to address the backlog of surgeries created by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we believe this plan will get people the care they need, as quickly and efficiently as possible.”   	    	The proposals, which can be submitted by both public and private facilities, must present details on how the applicant will be able to address priority surgical and diagnostic areas by creating additional capacity in the system.    	    	“The Manitoba government already works with a number of providers outside the public system to provide services, including cataract surgeries, and other surgical and diagnostic procedures,” said Friesen. “This government believes Manitobans deserve better health care, sooner. This initiative demonstrates that we are committed to exploring all available options to get surgeries and procedures rescheduled so that Manitobans have access to the care they need now, while the risk of COVID-19 is lower.”   	    	Priority areas include, but are not limited to:   	• pediatric dental surgeries;   	• pediatric ear, nose and throat surgeries;   	• minor orthopedic procedures;   	• ophthalmology surgery;   	• outpatient spine procedures; and   	• outpatient urology surgeries.    	    	Services must be able to be delivered beginning Aug. 1.    	    	The proposals must also consider and identify how services can be provided by meeting all required legislative, regulatory and standards requirements including regulatory body licensure requirements for health providers. In addition, the proposals must not affect existing service delivery capacity in the public system.   	    	The health-care system paused elective surgeries in late March to ensure there was capacity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic if case numbers continued to increase. Surgical volumes were reduced by approximately 7,000 procedures. In late April, elective surgeries resumed as case numbers fell and surgical volumes reached 90 per cent of normal levels by early June. At that time, there were approximately 5,500 people still waiting to have their surgery rescheduled.    	    	The minister noted this is similar to a process that was arranged in British Columbia.    	    	The request is posted to MERX at www.merx.com under an open tendering process.   	    	- 30 -  "

That spending is targeted as follows:    	• protecting Manitobans – $932 million;   	• protecting livelihoods – $477 million; and   	• restarting the economy – $774 million.   	    	Manitoba Finance is planning for three economic scenarios:  a quick economic rebound or ‘V’, a gradual economic rebound or ‘U’, and a long, limited recovery or ‘L’.   	    	Under the ‘V’ impact scenario, the 2020-21 summary net debt is projected to exceed $29 billion with a net debt to GDP ratio at nearly 41 per cent. This is up from 34.2 per cent forecast in Budget 2020. Higher interest costs alone on this new debt amounts to $70 million more per year, which is equal to building three new schools each and every year going forward, Fielding added.   	    	“Thanks to the government’s effective fiscal management and targeted investments in emergency preparedness prior to the pandemic, Manitoba was better prepared to face this crisis,” said Fielding. “However, the impacts of COVID-19 will take several years to address, and should we have a COVID comeback and the global economy fails to grow, we will wind up with higher projected deficit and debt levels.”   	    	Manitoba’s economy is expected to decline by approximately five per cent this year with an expected loss of revenues in the range of $1.5 billion this year and over $1 billion next year. With additional unanticipated spending underway to combat COVID this year, a rapid restart to the economy will be required or the province’s financial problems will deteriorate further, the minister noted.   	    	Manitoba’s road to recovery will focus on two strategies:  continued investments in public health preparedness and increased investment in jobs and growth, the premier added.   	    	“There is only one way out of the global economic and public health crisis, and that is to keep our COVID curve flat and grow our economy,” said Pallister. “Beating COVID creates jobs.”   	    	To view the Economic and Fiscal Outlook visit www.manitoba.ca/RestartMB.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

This system will bring hot conditions to southern and central Manitoba, with some areas experiencing extreme heat for three or four days.   	    	Everyone is at risk for the effects of heat. However, during a period of prolonged heat, older adults, people with chronic illness and people living alone have a particularly high risk for heat illness, especially if they are living in an urban area or do not have air conditioning. Others at greater health risks to heat include infants and young children, and people who work or exercise in the heat.   	    	Take care of yourself and others. Check in regularly with vulnerable or socially isolated community members, friends and family. Contact people by phone where possible to reduce face-to-face interactions, which will help control the spread of COVID-19.   	    	Never leave people or pets alone in a parked vehicle or direct sunlight.   	    	Certain substances, including amphetamines, MDMA (ecstasy), cocaine, alcohol and cannabis can alter mental status as well as increase the risk of over-heating. Some medications can also increase risk, so it is important to ask doctors or pharmacists whether prescribed medication affects the ability to cope with heat.   	    	If someone has many of the following symptoms, their body may be overheating and at risk of heat illness or heat stroke:   	• headache;   	• red, hot and dry skin;   	• dizziness;   	• confusion;   	• nausea;   	• rapid weak pulse; and    	• a complete or partial loss of consciousness.   	    	The longer a person’s body temperature is above 40 C (105 F), the greater the likelihood of permanent effects or death. If these symptoms occur, immediately move to a cool place and drink water.   	    	Emergency medical care may be needed depending on the severity of symptoms. If someone has a high body temperature, is unconscious or is confused, call for help. While waiting, cool the person right away by moving them to a cool place, apply cold water to large areas of the skin or clothing, and fan the person as much as possible.   	    	Heat illnesses are preventable. The health effects of heat can be reduced by:   	• drinking plenty of liquids, especially water, before feeling thirsty;   	• wearing loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing and a wide-brimmed hat;   	• planning outdoor activities during cooler times of the day;   	• limiting alcohol consumption;   	• avoiding sun exposure and considering cancelling or rescheduling outdoor activities;   	• going to a cool place such as a mall, community centre, public library or place of worship, after checking the hours these sites are open under COVID-19 restrictions;   	• taking a cool shower or bath; and   	• blocking sun out by closing awnings, curtains or blinds during the day.   	    	Regularly updated weather forecasts are available from Environment and Climate Change Canada at https://weather.gc.ca/canada_e.html.   	    	For more information on heat and health, call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) 1-888-315-9257, or visit:   	• www.manitoba.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/heat.html;    	• www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/sun-safety/extreme-heat-heat-waves.html or   	• www.safemanitoba.com for workplace concerns.   	    	- 30 -  "

On June 27, 2020, the four provinces were the first to implement the online Multi-jurisdictional Registry Access Service (MRAS), a hub that allows corporate information sharing between the provinces, making extra-provincial registration faster and easier.     	    	“People using this new service will find it easier to register their business in multiple provinces, and efficiently complete necessary paperwork through one central hub,” said Anne Kang, B.C.’s Minister of Citizens’ Services. “This joint effort under the New West Partnership Agreement streamlines trade between our provinces and opens up the possibility of including other provinces and territories in the future.”    	    	As members of the New West Partnership Trade Agreement, the four western provinces committed to reconciling business registration and reporting requirements between the jurisdictions, thus simplifying extra-provincial business registration processes.    	    	“The launch of this online service is just one of the ways we are cutting red tape for businesses, which is especially important as we relaunch our economy. MRAS is convenient and efficient, and makes it easier for Alberta job creators to expand their operations across western Canada and for western Canadian job creators to grow into Alberta,” said Nate Glubish, Alberta’s Minister for Service Alberta.   	    	Through MRAS, other jurisdictions will eventually be able to share corporate information, thus extending the New West Partnership’s efficiencies across Canada.    	    	“We are always pleased to reduce red tape and make it easier for businesses to register and set up operations in Saskatchewan and Western Canada,” said Don Morgan, Saskatchewan’s Minister of Justice and Attorney General.    	    	“Manitoba is eager to work with our western neighbours under the New West Partnership Agreement and find ways to make life easier for business owners,” said Scott Fielding, Manitoba’s Minister of Finance. “A priority for our government is to reduce red tape and this is another way we are able to do so and improve economic trade across Western Canada.”   	    	“We are pleased to see the western provinces move ahead with the Multi-jurisdictional Registry Access Service and reduce the regulatory burden on businesses who operate within different provinces. Today’s announcement is one step in the right direction on creating a more open interprovincial trade environment in Canada. It is encouraging to see these provinces move on this key recommendation CFIB made to the Canada Free Trade Agreement,” said Marilyn Braun-Pollon, CFIB’s vice-president, Western Canada & Agri-business.    	   Quick Facts:   	• MRAS allows jurisdictions to share corporate information so corporations and limited partnerships can complete and update their extra-provincial registration online.    	• MRAS also includes a national corporate registry search tool, which provides core registration information for corporations and extra-provincial corporations.   	• At this time, MRAS is not available for limited liability partnerships and co-operatives. These filings will continue to be completed through the current model.    	    	- 30 -   	   The Province of Manitoba is distibuting this release on behalf of the governments of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.   	   "

MARY'S ROAD AND SOUTH PERIMETER HIGHWAY  					  Improvements Planned to Improve Safety and Traffic Flow Along Major Economic Corridor:  Schuler  Watch news conference       	As part of the $500-million Manitoba Restart Program, the province is planning to construct a new interchange to improve safety and the flow of traffic at the intersection of Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 100 and St. Mary’s Road, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.   	    	“As part of the Trans-Canada Highway, the South Perimeter Highway is one of Manitoba’s most important trade corridors and plays a strategic role as it also connects with PTH 75, our major route to the United States,” said Schuler. “A new interchange will improve reliability and efficiency of Canada’s international and inter-provincial trade flows and support the growth of our economy.”   	    	PTH 100 (South Perimeter Highway) and St. Mary’s Road is an at-grade intersection with traffic signals. The minister noted the intersection currently leads to high levels of traffic congestion during peak hours and has a high rate of vehicle collisions.   	    	“The safety of the South Perimeter Highway has been a priority of our government, and these improvements will build on the measures we’ve taken over the past few years to create a safer and more efficient roadway for the approximately 30,000 vehicles that use it daily,” said Schuler. “With residential, commercial and industrial growth in south Winnipeg and communities south of the city, it is time to build the South Perimeter Highway to a freeway standard.”   	    	In 2018, the province developed a South Perimeter Highway Safety Plan, which included closing some uncontrolled access points and median openings. It also launched a long-term South Perimeter Highway design study to reconstruct PTH 100 to a freeway standard with no at-grade crossings from the Trans-Canada Highway West interchange at Portage Avenue to the Trans-Canada Highway East interchange at Fermor Avenue. Intersecting roadways and railways would be separated through interchanges and overpasses. The province held public consultation and expects to complete its study this summer, the minister noted.   	    	Schuler added the design study recommends an interchange at PTH 100 and St. Mary’s Road, and construction is expected to begin in 2021.   	    	Funding for the St. Mary’s Road interchange is part of the $500-million Manitoba Restart Program, an economic stimulus package to help restart Manitoba’s economy and ramp up construction in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The province has included $65 million for major highway projects, including the PTH 100 and St. Mary’s Road interchange. Further projects funded under the Manitoba Restart Program will be announced in the coming weeks.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

Visitors to Lake Winnipeg should minimize water contact if lake levels are high and strong winds are blowing from the north. Research shows E. coli counts tend to be elevated during these conditions as they are washed out of the wet beach sand and into the swimming area.    	    	This week, algal blooms were sampled at Pelican Lake (Ninette and Pleasant Valley), Oak Lake, Metigoshe, Sandy Lake, Silver Beach Lake and Rivers Reservoir beach. The number of blue-green algae cells was above Manitoba’s recreational water quality objective at all beaches, while the concentration of algal toxin microcystin was below the recreational water quality objective at all beaches. First level algae advisory signs were posted at all above mentioned beaches this week.   	    	Algal blooms are difficult to predict and may form and then disperse quickly or last for several days or weeks. Warm and calm weather coupled with relatively high nutrient loads provide ideal conditions for blue-green algae to develop. People are reminded to avoid swimming in water where severe algal blooms are visible and to prevent pets from drinking water along the shoreline where algal blooms are present. Home and cottage owners who use lake water as a source for drinking water should be aware that most small treatment systems are unable to remove algal toxins. Therefore, where blue-green algal blooms are present, avoid drinking the water or using it for other domestic purposes.    	    	Information on beach water quality results, advisory signs posted at beaches and swimmer and water safety is available at www.manitoba.ca/beaches.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

Bird seed can attract bears as well as birds, and with other food sources plentiful for birds in the summer months, people are asked to put feeders away until later in the fall.   	    	Once a bear is attracted to an area, it can associate that area with food and may return multiple times, which can be dangerous for people, but also for the bear. If a bear is identified as a problem animal, the province may have to take steps to trap and relocate it or possibly use lethal force.   	    	To enjoy birdwatching, Manitobans are encouraged to use birdhouses, birdbaths or grow a variety of bird-friendly plant species in their yards. Bird feeders should be removed April to November. For winter bird-feeding, the feeders should be hung at least two metres above the ground and spilled seed should be cleaned up regularly.   	    	Additional ‘Wildlife Smart’ tips to reduce the risk of conflicts with black bears and other wildlife include:   	• never approach or feed a bear or any other wild animal;   	• restrain (leash) dogs when walking outside to reduce the potential of it harassing a bear or of being attacked by one as unrestrained dogs can lead a bear back to the dog’s owner;   	• store garbage in a secure building or bear resistant container;   	• secure compost piles or compost food items indoors;   	• remove ripened or fallen fruit daily in the morning and before dusk and do not allow it to rot on the ground;   	• allow barbecue grills to burn for about two minutes after cooking to burn off grease and to eliminate odors;    	• clean grills and grease cups after each use;    	• clean up after picnics in the yard or on a deck and do not allow food odors to linger;   	• feed pets indoors; and   	• fully enclose backyard beehives and chicken coops – electric fencing is an effective bear deterrent.   	    	These measures also apply to other wildlife species that can be a problem, such as the coyote, fox, raccoon and skunk.   	    	Bears are wild animals and must be respected.  When in bear country, it is best to assume bears are in the vicinity even if no recent conflict or encounters have been reported. Carry bear deterrent spray and know how to use it.  Be aware of surroundings, walk or jog in groups, make noise and make sure things like listening to music with earphones do not impede hearing.   	    	More information on how to be Wildlife Smart is available at www.manitoba.ca/human-wildlife.    	    	- 30 -  "

Many are struggling to meet lease obligations, prevent layoffs and manage drops in revenue due to COVID-related circumstances. The government’s action will temporarily ban evictions of commercial tenants during the pandemic if the landlords and tenants are eligible for CECRA but have not applied.    	    	The federal government’s rent relief program has been set up to have landlords apply and work with their tenants to receive rent relief. Not all landlords eligible for this funding are applying, leaving tenants without an option to stay in their current leased commercial space. The CECRA program runs until Aug. 31.   	    	Manitoba has received only approximately 145 applications and has paid out $1.5 million of the $64 million available. The minister said it is hoped this measure will create an additional incentive for landlords and tenants to work together and apply to the CECRA, as well as keep businesses from closing or having to relocate during the pandemic.    	    	The temporary measures have been introduced under The Emergency Measures Act and are consistent with initiatives in other provinces.   	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:  https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.    	    	- 30 -   	   "

Our investment in the Parkland region will create jobs and encourage further economic development in the area.”   	    	Vermillion Growers has started construction of the first large-scale greenhouse in Manitoba. The high-tech hydroponic commercial greenhouse development in Dauphin will be designed for vegetable production, consisting initially of tomatoes with plans to expand to a wide range of produce. Phase One of the project is a 10-acre facility, with plans to expand to 60 acres after five years of production. Vermillion Growers plans to plant its first crop in early 2021.    	    	“Manitoba is committed to creating an environment for a competitive, sustainable and adaptable agriculture and agri-food industry that ensures it thrives as a key economic driver,” said Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen. “Having a large-scale greenhouse in Manitoba is very important from a food security standpoint – access to fresh, locally grown produce year-round is a great benefit for Manitobans.”    	    	“Canada currently imports close to 90 per cent of our table fresh tomatoes, but Vermillion Growers will displace some of these imported tomatoes with local product, meaning healthier food and more jobs for our community and province,” said Maria Deschauer, managing director and proprietor of Vermillion Growers. “Once fully built, the site will provide 60 acres of growing area, requiring Vermillion Growers to create the equivalent of 180 full-time positions. Vermillion Growers is thrilled by the support of the Manitoba government and looks forward to working with the province as Vermillion expands.”   	    	The province unveiled the MWCI in May 2020 as a new approach to tax-increment financing that rebates the incremental education property taxes generated by a project for up to 20 years. Approved projects receive a tax rebate based on the difference between pre-development property tax revenue and the increased amount generated by the completed project. The program aims to encourage significant new business investment or existing business expansion, noted Eichler.   	    	A new or existing business interested in establishing or expanding its operations in Manitoba may apply for the MWCI if:    	• the business is prepared to make a minimum capital investment of $10 million to a specific property, which will be designated for tax-increment financing benefits;    	• a minimum of 65 per cent of total project costs are from private sources; and    	• there is demonstrable potential to create and/or maintain at least 10 new jobs in the province, or the new business activity will have a substantial and measurable net economic benefit to the province.   	    	The minister’s visit to the region on Friday includes a Parkland regional economic development meeting held in collaboration with Team Manitoba strategic and regional partners, namely Manitoba’s new Rural Economic Development Corporation, North Forge Technology Exchange, World Trade Centre Winnipeg and Travel Manitoba.  The meeting will also include provincial representatives, the mayor and reeve of Dauphin, and key industry stakeholders, organizations and community leaders to discuss partnerships and ensure the Parkland region is best positioned to enable investment and economic growth.   	    	For more information on the MWCI, visit www.gov.mb.ca/jec/busdev/financial/mwci/index.html.   	    	- 30 -  "

We are especially grateful today for this financial assistance from the province, which will enable us to continue to meet those needs and plans for whatever challenges arise going forward.”   	    	The Centre of Hope is at Henry Avenue and Martha Street, and includes a residential mental health program, transitional housing for individuals who have been released from a correctional facility, emergency shelter beds and a number of on-site programs to support people toward independence and stability.   	    	The minister also noted this funding includes one month of operational costs ($22,000) previously announced to support Samaritan House Ministries’ Safe and Warm Shelter in Brandon.  The 10-bed emergency shelter typically is open only in the winter months, but ongoing provincial support has helped it continue to serve vulnerable clients throughout the summer.     	    	This investment is part of the Manitoba Protection Plan, a government-wide response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   	    	For more information on COVID-19, including supports and programs in place for Manitobans, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.   	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:  https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.   	    	    	- 30 -   	   "

While we can’t be sure what the COVID-19 pandemic will look like in the fall, detailed planning is needed to ensure schools can resume in-class learning and to prepare for different scenarios,” said Goertzen. “This framework will allow schools and school divisions to prepare plans that are flexible at the local level, yet consistent with those at other sites across the province.”   	    	The framework provides guidance for school divisions to develop detailed reopening plans to be submitted to Manitoba Education for three public health scenarios including:   	• in-class learning with near-normal conditions;   	• in-class learning, taking additional public health measures into consideration; and    	• remote learning from home, with limited use of school facilities.   	    	The minister noted that while the plan is for all students to return to classroom learning in the fall, Manitoba Education will provide final confirmation by Aug. 1 based on public health directions.   	    	Significant consultation with students, parents, teachers and education stakeholders occurred over the past month to gauge their comfort, with tens of thousands of Manitobans providing feedback.   	    	Divisions will ensure all schools have plans that are accessible to parents and students. Funded independent schools will also be asked to submit plans and post them publicly.   	    	“Public health officials expect the COVID-19 virus to be around for some time and that’s why schools need to develop plans for the fall,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “In addition to these plans, it will continue to be important for people to stay home if they are sick, ensure physical distancing, continue to practise good hand hygiene and cover coughs.”   	    	The framework also outlines key considerations that should be addressed in the school and division plans including:   	• ensuring schools can respond and adapt to changing public health orders and guidance;   	• making sure any necessary physical distancing requirements can be met;   	• considering the use of cohorts in classrooms, on buses and during activities to limit exposure to COVID-19;   	• planning with a focus on in-class learning and establishing priorities;   	• looking at ways to accommodate specialty programming and extracurricular activities;   	• considering how school transportation can be safely offered;   	• looking at blended learning options that can be implemented quickly;   	• making arrangements for students, teachers and staff who may be at higher risk of COVID-19; and   	• considering learning and assessment needs, as well as any educational gaps for students as a result of the pandemic.   	    	“Students, parents, teachers, staff and administrators have had to make many adjustments in a very short period of time, and I thank everyone who has worked hard to find solutions to keep everyone safe during the pandemic,” said Goertzen. “By taking the time to develop thorough plans, we can continue to protect the health and well-being of our school communities while ensuring that students have the opportunity to learn and develop their skills.”   	    	The report can be viewed at www.manitoba.ca/covid19/restoring/safeschools.html and feedback can be provided at https://engagemb.ca.   	    	For up-to-date information on COVID-19 in Manitoba, visit www.manitoba.ca/COVID19.    	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:  https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.   	    	- 30 -  "

A new Buffalo Crossing multi-purpose public facility will be constructed, and will feature educational and recreational elements including adventure and nature play areas.    	    	The contribution is being made through the New Building Canada Fund – Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component – National and Regional Projects, with the Government of Canada also investing $4.7 million.   	    	Work is underway on the interpretive centre and construction on the Buffalo Crossing facility is anticipated to begin in early 2021, with project completion being targeted for 2022, the premier noted.   	    	“Now more than ever, we see how important time spent in nature is as it restores us, builds resilience and gives us a sense of hope,” said Liz Wilson, president and CEO of FortWhyte Alive. “This forward-thinking investment by the Province of Manitoba provides stability to FortWhyte Alive and ensures hands-on environmental education, grounded in climate change science, will be accessible for generations of Manitobans.”   	    	The province has also provided a $4-million contribution to the FortWhyte Forever Endowment Fund held by The Winnipeg Foundation.

This is increasingly important as we address the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”   	    	Jobs on 9th, located at 157-340 Ninth Ave. in Brandon, began working with clients in November 2019. Three staff help clients who are looking for employment and training options by assessing their needs and rapidly developing personalized plans to help them enter or return to the workforce. Since it opened, Jobs on 9th counsellors have established strong partnerships with community resources and non-governmental organizations that support individuals seeking work, such as Samaritan House Employment Resource Centre (SH-ERC).    	    	“With the launching of the new employment program Jobs on 9th, we will continue to work with the province to provide increased support to transition people into employment,” said Nataliya Masyuk, SH-ERC program manager/employment officer. “The new employment program will increase EIA recipients’ job readiness and boost their confidence by reducing and removing barriers for employment. In conjunction, SH-ERC will support clients in accomplishing their employment goals by providing resume services and delivering information through employment workshops. We will work collaboratively to improve clients’ success rate for employment and help them to achieve financial independence faster.”   	    	Services at Jobs on 9th include resume development, job-search counselling, job, education and training referrals, and access to computers, phones and printers. Work-related expenses for clothing, transportation and equipment are also available for eligible clients. Staff follow clients’ progress for up to 90 days to support their success and to address any possible challenges.     	    	Since it launched, Jobs on 9th has provided services to more than 170 clients and about one-quarter of them have gained independence from EIA to date, the minister noted.   	    	“The City of Brandon is always pleased to see supports for job creation and employment opportunities in our community,” said Mayor Rick Chrest, City of Brandon. “The establishment of this service for our area has been well-received by local clients.”   	    	This approach is modelled after the successful Jobs on Market office in Winnipeg. Since Jobs on Market launched in February 2017, it has worked with more than 6,600 people and over 3,100 of them have gained financial independence.   	    	The minister noted that Jobs on 9th is highlighted as one of the priority areas for the Department of Families in its 12-month action plan, recognizing its importance to clients, the community and the province overall. The strategy is available online at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/pubs/shared-priorities-sustainable-progress.pdf.    	    	Individuals in Brandon and the surrounding region who receive EIA should contact their counsellors directly for more information.

The province has implemented short-term solutions over the past couple of years, such as the reduction of speed limits in the area and installation of rumble strips to warn drivers of the upcoming stop sign.   	    	The Manitoba government undertook a virtual public engagement online via EngageMB from May 25 to June 5. The engagement presented two options:  the installation of traffic lights and auxiliary turning lanes, and a roundabout.   	    	A total of 505 responses were received and 80 per cent of respondents reported using the intersection daily or weekly. Construction to improve safety at the intersection was the option chosen by 87 per cent of engagement participants.   	    	“We are incredibly pleased at the participation rate of the virtual engagement, considering Manitoba Infrastructure’s in-person open houses receive on average 75 to 100 participants,” said Schuler. “Due to public health guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgency to improve safety at this intersection, we tested out a virtual model. Based on its success, we hope to incorporate online public engagement on future projects as it offers an accessible and convenient format to involve more Manitobans.”   	    	Staff identified several themes when analyzing the feedback including increased safety through a combination of driver education, traffic law enforcement and roundabout design.    	    	Results of the engagement indicated a roundabout is the preferred option for the intersection. Construction on the project is expected to begin this summer and be completed this fall, the minister noted.   	    	“Safety is a top priority for our Springfield council and we welcome the safety upgrades at the intersection of PR 206 and Garven Road,” said Mayor Tiffany Fell, Rural Municipality of Springfield. “We appreciate the province has taken the time to listen to our residents.”   	    	EngageMB is a central location where the public can easily learn about and contribute to all Manitoba government engagements underway. It is a convenient location for Manitobans to learn engagement results and view a final report on the initiative under consideration. The minister noted the government is committed to be accountable to the public, include the public in decision-making processes and be transparent on findings and outcomes.   	    	The What We Heard report is available at:  https://gov.mb.ca/asset_library/engagemb/infrastructure/garvenroad/garven_road_what_we_heard.pdf.   	    	- 30 -  "

The province estimates removing the sales tax on property insurance will save residential property owners $38 million per year and commercial property owners $37 million a year.   	    	Starting July 1, the province is reducing vehicle registration fees by 10 per cent, which is expected to save drivers $11 million, and builds on the $110 million in rebate cheques that Manitoba Public Insurance returned to policyholders this spring.   	    	The minister said these measures are among several in the 2020 Tax Rollback Guarantee, introduced by the Manitoba government to make life more affordable for individuals, families and businesses.    	    	“We want to help Manitoba taxpayers hang on to more of their hard-earned dollars, which is even more important in these challenging times brought on by the global pandemic,” said Fielding. “These measures build on other tax initiatives our government has introduced, such as reducing the PST to seven per cent from eight, indexing the basic personal allowance and personal income tax brackets, and removing PST from the preparation of wills.”   	    	Due to COVID-19, the province also extended filing deadlines for small and medium-sized businesses with monthly remittances of no more than $10,000 for the April, May and June sales tax and Health and Post-Secondary Education Tax Levy, commonly called the payroll tax.

The expected outcome is for simpler, faster and more efficient judicial proceedings.”    	    	The state-of-the-art information technology system will support the operations of all three levels of Manitoba courts and its branches. Currently, there are more than 20 different systems throughout Manitoba courts that are not integrated and the majority of the systems are paper-based, requiring manual updating.   	    	“Technology helps us to provide greater access to justice, and these changes will complement other recently implemented improvements to the court’s scheduling and case flow models in all areas of judicial service,” said Chief Justice Glenn Joyal, chief justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench. “Given the diverse breadth of the judicial service provided by the Court of Queen’s Bench in the areas of criminal, civil, family and child protection proceedings, this modernization will be highly beneficial to Manitobans.”    	    	“The provincial court of Manitoba presides in all court centres and up to 50 circuit court communities in Manitoba,” said Chief Judge Margaret Wiebe, chief judge of the provincial court. “A single, web-based case management system that could be accessed remotely throughout the province would speed up court proceedings and make the system more efficient overall.”    	    	Once implemented, the system will reduce the need for personal attendance at court offices by counsel and the public to conduct routine business such as filing documents, scheduling hearings and paying fines or fees. In addition, online dispute resolution will reduce backlog and allow the court to focus on more serious, high-conflict matters.   	    	Due to the scale and technical nature of the project, the province worked with outside agencies to complete the request for proposals. An external expert was hired to develop the technical content, and a change management consultant worked with Manitoba courts and its stakeholders to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth transition.    	    	The project is a result of the Idea Fund, which supports innovative initiatives within government. These ideas are advanced by front-line public servants and are designed to produce meaningful return on investment for taxpayers.     	    	The RFP has been posted to MERX at www.merx.com under an open tendering process.     	    	- 30 -   	   "

It was designed based on input from Manitobans and is supported by legislative change and service innovation, the minister said.   	    	Families can now access:   	• early resolution support services delivered by family guides with expertise in domestic violence and safety planning, conflict resolution and mediation, family law and court processes;   	• navigation assistance to other culturally and linguistically appropriate specialized services, which could include a new Child Support Service, Legal Aid, expanded enforcement or other financial, legal or health and social services;    	• self-service tools and a resource inventory that is searchable by region and issue; and    	• support to complete any prerequisites for court.   	    	The new service also allows families to access support electronically, which is particularly beneficial during the COVID-19  pandemic, the minister said.    	    	The minister also noted that changes to The Family Law Modernization Act coming into effect July 1 expand the role of the Child Support Recalculation Service and give it the authority to make initial child support decisions in a broad range of cases, such as changes in employment, without going to court.    	    	The Manitoba government also expanded the Maintenance Enforcement Program (MEP) in April to help families meet the increased challenges brought about by COVID-19. The program now has authority to review and adjust maintenance as needed, and more families have been able to resolve support enforcement issues by working with the program instead of having to make court applications.   	    	It is critical to note that families will still be able to pursue in-court options and appear before a judge if required, the minister added.   	    	These changes are expected to take thousands of matters out of court and could result in up to $41 million in annual savings in court and legal fees for Manitoba families, noted the minister.   	    	“These enhancements reflect our progress on recommendations made by Manitobans and are the latest in our ongoing efforts to modernize the family law system in Manitoba,” said Cullen.   	    	Every year, approximately 3,000 to 5,000 Manitoba families are affected by separation or divorce.

Since his appointment, McDonald has presided at the swearing-in ceremonies of town councillors and local school trustees, and has appeared before local student groups to explain the functioning of the provincial court and duties and responsibilities of provincial court judges.    	    	He has presented at education sessions of the provincial court on procedure and rules in provincial family court proceedings. He served as a facilitator at a joint Manitoba/Saskatchewan Bench conference, and as a mentor for a recent judicial appointment.   	    	McDonald is the chairperson of the Facilities Committee of the provincial court and is currently a member of the Family Rules Committee, the Canadian Association of Provincial Court Judges and the Committee on Access to Justice.    	    	He graduated from the University of Manitoba in 1982 with a bachelor of law and was a partner at Law North, formerly McDonald Huberdeau, prior to his judicial appointment.    	    	Associate chief judges are appointed for a non-renewable term of seven years.

Français  June 23, 2020 MANITOBA SUPPORTS EXPANSION OF THE MOTHERING PROJECT AT MOUNT CARMEL CLINIC  					  Funding Supports End of Birth Alerts as of June 30:  Stefanson   Backgrounder Background Information  Watch news conference       	The Manitoba government is investing nearly $400,000 to double the capacity of the Mothering Project (Manito Ikwe Kagiikwe), ensuring better health and family outcomes for at-risk women and their children as part of a commitment to end the use of birth alerts on June 30, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.   	    	“The Mothering Project helps keep families together by supporting vulnerable mothers when they need help,” said Stefanson. “Our government is committed to preventative programs that help to reduce the number of children in care by building partnerships with organizations like Mount Carmel Clinic. This new funding will ensure more families can stay together safely with the help of community-based supports they know and trust.”     	    	The Mothering Project at Mount Carmel Clinic helps connect vulnerable mothers with services and programs to support health and wellness for themselves and their children. Culturally safe supports are available during pregnancy and throughout their children’s early years including pre-natal care, health services, drop-in programs, healthy meals and nutritional learning, parenting groups, child development supports and child-care services, access to Indigenous ceremonies and teachings, and support to address needs such as housing, mental health and addictions, counselling and system navigation.     	    	This investment will allow Mount Carmel Clinic to serve up to 200 families by adding four new staff.     	    	“This expansion will allow us to build even more positive relationships with mothers,” said Bobbette Shoffner, executive director, Mount Carmel Clinic. “We are creating a circle of care to ensure a healthier pregnancy and more positive outcomes for mom, baby and the entire family in the longer term. An investment today creates a lifetime of benefits for all of our participating families.”    	    	Eligible women are either pregnant or have had a child in the past year and are considered vulnerable because they struggle with substance use and addictions, are homeless or at risk of homelessness, are involved with the child welfare system or at high risk to have a child taken into care, or are not connected with community supports.    	    	The minister noted this investment supports Manitoba’s plan to replace the use of birth alerts with preventative and community-based supports for families. Over the past year, the province has worked very closely with child welfare authorities and agencies to help ensure at-risk mothers and families are connected with resources, information and supports, while limiting the use of birth alerts to the greatest extent possible. Four birth alerts were issued in May 2020, compared with 38 in May 2019.   	    	Manitoba Child and Family Services (CFS) agencies will be able to refer more women to this program, which further supports the shift away from the practice of birth alerts. The program will include a CFS liaison who will create strong partnerships with the CFS system to reinforce this change in practice. Expanding this program also supports the province’s plan to transform the child welfare system and aligns with recommendations from the Child Welfare Legislative Review Committee.   	    	A 2015 evaluation found the Mothering Project had reduced the number of children entering care, increased access to health-care services and reduced substance use.   	    	Funding for these initiatives is being provided under the Canada-Manitoba Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement. In the past eight months, the Manitoba government has committed $38.2 million toward 21 initiatives to improve mental health and addictions services throughout the province.   	    	The province will commit $350,000 annually to Mount Carmel Clinic, beginning in 2021-22 to ensure that expanded services continue.   	    	Mount Carmel Clinic is a community-based not-for-profit organization that provides primary health and community services, as well as early learning supports, primarily to residents of Winnipeg’s north end.

Both pieces of equipment are now operational.   	    	“Ensuring diagnostic equipment is reliable and ensures timely access to quality care for Manitoba patients are high priorities as we continue to implement the recommendations of Manitoba’s first provincial clinical and preventive services plan,” said Petr Kresta, chief operating officer of diagnostic services, Shared Health. “Investments in this vital equipment will ensure we continue to meet the needs of Manitoba’s growing and aging population.”   	    	Since 2016, the Manitoba government has significantly improved diagnostic services in the province. This includes the recent launch of echocardiography services at the Selkirk Regional Health Centre. MRI services have also been added in Selkirk and at the Dauphin Regional Health Centre to handle increasing patient volumes.   	    	“Our government has responded to the growing demands of an aging population with increasing health-care needs by expanding diagnostic services and bringing them closer to home,” said Friesen.  “These new pieces of clinical equipment are aligned with Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan and will ensure more patients get the care they need, when they need it.”   	    	For more information on Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan, visit www.gov.mb.ca/health/pcpsp.html.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

While these programs have helped Canadians through financial challenges caused by the pandemic, CERB has become a barrier preventing some from returning to work.”   	    	The premier noted Manitoba’s program will provide one initial payment of $500 plus three additional bi-weekly payments for $500 each, for a total of $2,000 over six weeks. Program participants must voluntarily stop collecting CERB or CESB support from the federal government.    	    	The province will fully finance the program, which does not require any contributions from employers in order for workers to qualify.   	    	“The best thing we can do to speed Canada’s economic recovery is to find safe ways to get people back to work,” said Dan Kelly, president and chief executive officer, Canadian Federation of Independent Business. “The Manitoba Job Restart program will help encourage more employees to return to their pre-COVID jobs, assisting both workers and small businesses along the way. CFIB encourages other provinces and the federal government to consider this and other ways to quickly transition workers from CERB back to paid employment.”   	    	To remain in the program, approved applicants must:    	• actively return to work in Manitoba to a job with at least 30 hours per week in order to be eligible for the first $500 payment;   	• complete a simple declaration for each of the following two weeks certifying that they are still working at least 30 hours per week in order to receive the next three $500 payments;   	• no longer receive CERB, CESB or similar COVID-19 related support from the federal government;   	• follow Manitoba’s COVID-19 health guidelines in the workplace; and   	• continue residing permanently in Manitoba and be legally entitled to work in Canada.   	    	The Manitoba Job Restart program will accept applications until July 31.

These youth will become PAX Dream Makers and interact with children and youth in their schools and communities, inspiring more than 800 other young Manitobans, Clarke noted.   	    	“By empowering youth to take leadership roles by creating peace, productivity, health and happiness, in their communities through PAX Dream Makers, we help them strengthen their relationships with each other and with youth in other communities,” said Stefanson.“This helps build stronger communities and leads to more positive mental health.”   	    	Dream Makers participants and their adult mentors attend four gatherings over the course of 24 months. Teams are brought together from different schools, allowing youth from different communities to foster relationships and learn from one another. At the end of this process, youth Dream Makers take on the mentoring role for new Dream Makers.   	    	“Our community is honoured by these PAX Youth Dream Makers and their passion to their communities and youth across Manitoba and beyond,” said Chief Jim Tobacco, Mosakahiken Cree Nation, Swampy Cree Tribal Council. “PAX Youth Dream Makers represent our commitment to our children and youth, as referenced in the Swampy Cree Annual General Assembly, unanimous passing of resolution #2019-001 to support PAX, Opaskwayak Cree Nation, Aug. 7, 2019.”   	    	Research has shown that students who participate in PAX do better in school and are more likely to graduate from high school. Participants need fewer special education services, have better mental health (including fewer suicidal thoughts/attempts), have fewer smoking, alcohol and drug addictions, and are less involved in crime into their adult years.   	    	Recent outreach projects include:   	• led by Pukatawagan PAX Dream Makers, an event was held at the Opaskwayak Cree Nation mall, where PAX was taught to the community and youth displayed clothing they had designed to represent their culture and traditions;   	• led by Norway House PAX Dream Makers, mapping of safe mental health supports for youth in Norway House was conducted;   	• a community clean-up event in Pukatawagan was led by Pukatawagan PAX Dream Makers;   	• led by Chemawawin PAX Dream Makers, instruction for Indigenous youth from across Canada was provided to develop a vision for their home communities and how to make it happen at the Indspire conference; and   	• in the spirit of reconciliation, a First Nations PAX Dream Maker cohort, is mentoring the newest PAX cohort from the Rolling River School Division.   	    	The investment in the PAX Dream Makers program aligns with recommendations made in the VIRGO report to expand mental health and addictions community outreach, promote and support the use of self-management tools, support the flexibility of community-based service delivery, expand services for children and youth, and ensure the use of evidence-based approaches.   	    	The ministers noted that PAX Dream Makers also directly responds to several Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action including eliminating educational gaps between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians, and establishing community-based youth organizations to deliver programs on reconciliation.    	    	The investment in PAX Dream Makers builds on more than $33.7 million invested in 19 mental health and addictions projects, the ministers said.   	    	- 30 -   	   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

Allowing people to receive two kits at a time will reduce travel to naloxone distribution sites, increase resources in the community and help people address social distancing requirements.”   	    	The minister noted the investment is part of the collaborative COVID-19 response to support people who are homeless, accessing shelters and using substances. This collaboration includes federal partners, regional health authorities and approximately 100 different community-based organizations that have come together to address a variety of issues including mental health and addictions in Manitoba.    	    	“Providing support for and addressing issues related to mental health and addictions remains our government’s priority,” said Friesen. “We’re committed to investing in projects, programs and services to support Manitobans living with a substance use disorder.”   	    	Naloxone is used as an antidote to an opioid overdose. It temporarily reverses the life-threatening slowed breathing from an opioid overdose.    	    	In the first three months of 2020, more than 1,315 kits were sent to distribution sites.   	    	As of Dec. 31, 2019, there were 104 take-home naloxone registered sites across the province including in all five health regions and in 27 First Nations. Between January 2017 and December 2019, 4,365 take-home naloxone kits were distributed to registered sites for people at risk of opioid overdose.    	    	From January 2017 to July 2019, there were 200 kits reported to have been used in the community during overdose events.   	    	For more information on where to access a take-home naloxone kit, visit:  https://streetconnections.ca/.    	    	- 30 -  "

We’re pleased with the input we received from the many invested stakeholders and look forward to making improvements to the program where possible.”    	    	The review was initiated to get a better understanding of the purchasing decisions of Manitoba producers in terms of forage insurance products available to them.    	    	Several key recommendations were made and immediate action items will be undertaken by MASC prior to the next insurance year. Some of which include:   	• exploring new methodologies to assign coverages to new insureds,   	• determining if the effect that disaster years have on future coverage can be minimized,   	• establishing insured values that better reflect the price of hay in claim years,   	• identifying areas where the administrative burden for insureds can be minimized,   	• reviewing the index-based insurance approach used in other jurisdictions which relies on weather or satellite-based technology, and   	• working more closely with industry to inform producers and increase awareness of the MASC Forage Insurance programs.   	    	The review was conducted using a number of different methods, including the EngageMB portal, focus groups and interviews with producers, MASC insurance agents, agricultural specialists, industry associations, financial advisors, as well as other insurance providers.   	    	More than 1,200 producers currently have forage insurance through MASC, insuring more than 272,000 acres. This represents about 18 per cent of the more than 1.5 million eligible acres of forage in Manitoba.    	    	The Forage Insurance program is part of AgriInsurance, a joint program of the Government of Canada and the Province of Manitoba under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership.    	    	For more information, and to view a copy of the review, visit:   https://gov.mb.ca/asset_library/en/proactive/2020_2021/forage-insurance-review-May-2020.pdf.    	    	- 30 -  "

As well, the province has received nearly 5,100 online submissions to https://EngageMB and over 32,000 responses on the school restart survey from parents and students.    	    	The final plan being released today is based on public health advice, consultation with key sectors and feedback from the public, the premier added.   	    	Key changes made following public feedback include:   	• removing the maximum capacity of 300 people at any site provided the gathering can be physically divided into sub-groups of 50 or fewer indoors or 100 or fewer outdoors, to a maximum 30 per cent of usual capacity;   	• allowing people from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and people living in the area of the northwestern Ontario (west of Terrace Bay) to visit Manitoba without having to self-isolate for 14 days;   	• ensuring those travelling to northern Manitoba must continue to respect any restrictions that have been put in place by local communities and First Nations;   	• lifting self-isolation requirements on a case-by-case basis where sectors propose and provide satisfactory plans to address public health requirements for necessary travel; and   	• lifting capacity limits for restaurants, bars, beverage rooms, brew pubs, microbreweries and distilleries, as long as tables and seating are arranged so there is a temporary or physical barrier, or two metres of separation between people sitting at different tables.   	    	Detailed information on the plan for Phase Three, including service restoration, measures the public can take to reduce their risk of COVID-19 exposure or spreading the virus, and workplace guidance for businesses, can be found at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices.   	    	“Current indicators show the risk of community transmission of the virus in Manitoba is low at this time, so we are now able to further ease restrictions while ensuring Manitobans still practice the fundamentals that got us to this stage,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public heath officer. “As businesses and communities expand the services they offer, all Manitobans must continue to practise physical distancing with others outside their households, wash their hands often and stay home when they are sick to further reduce the risk of spreading the virus.”    	    	The province continues to encourage businesses to take steps to help staff, customers and visitors stay safe including:   	• ensuring people are able to reasonably maintain two metres of distance;   	• only conducting necessary and brief exchanges within two metres of others;   	• applying enhanced cleaning protocols, especially in common areas like washrooms;   	• maintaining physical distancing and food-handling protocols in workplace areas including lunch and common areas;   	• ensuring staff stay home when feeling sick; and   	• following personal risk reduction measures.   	    	Since May 21, Manitobans have engaged over 124,000 times through online surveys and telephone town halls to provide feedback on the Restoring Safe Services roadmap and restarting schools.    	    	The premier also noted the province is developing a rapid response system to guide future decisions and any additional reopening steps that may be considered. Each level will include a risk assessment and a range of measures that may be in place at that level. As work continues to monitor the spread of the virus, the province may move up or down the rapid response/’stoplight’ scale as indicators change.   	    	“While we can take pride in the progress we’ve made and the additional steps we are announcing today, we must remain vigilant,” said Pallister. “If public health results deteriorate or guidelines are not sufficient, Phase Three measures may be paused and previous measures may be reintroduced. I’m confident that we will continue to be successful if we keep working together as a team.”   	    	The survey for the third phase and the plan to restart Manitoba schools will be open until June 21.

Stakeholders comprised 15 unions, critical service providers and business community organizations that represent more than 17,000 businesses and 110,000 workers.   	    	The payment is available to part-time and full-time employees in various public- and private-sector positions that include the areas of health care, social services, justice, transportation, food and beverage, and essential retail. Essential workers must have worked a minimum 200 cumulative hours (or would have worked that amount but were required to self-isolate under public health orders) from March 20 to May 29.    	    	To expand the program, the province once again solicited input from the stakeholder group. A majority of stakeholders voted to increase the qualifying threshold to a total pre-tax employment income of less than $5,000 per month, or $12,500 total during the 2.5-month eligibility period, and exclude overtime from the total gross income calculation.    	    	The program has also been expanded to include the following positions:    	• hotel workers (reception, cleaners, maintenance, kitchen staff, servers, security); and   	• Business Improvement Zone staff (patrol, graffiti removal, street cleaners, distributors of COVID-19-related education material and Personal Protective Equipment).   	    	“By increasing eligible positions and income limits, and excluding overtime earnings, we will ensure the program continues to support lower- to middle-income workers and recognizes those who may have otherwise worked themselves out of qualifying through overtime,” said Fielding. “Manitoba’s program continues to reflect the federal government’s intention of this cost-sharing program to recognize low-income Canadian workers who risked their own health to provide crucial services.”   	    	The minister is encouraging all eligible workers to apply for the program and view the full list of positions at https://manitoba.ca/covid19/infomanitobans/mrrp.html.    	    	The province has extended the application deadline until Monday, June 29 at noon. It will issue payment via direct deposit once it verifies applications and plans to fully distribute the $120-million fund. As the fund will be divided equally between all successful applicants, the number of program participants will determine individual payments.   	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:  https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.   	    	- 30 -  "

In many cases, they have been providing emergency food items as part of the community response to COVID-19, but the pilot program will allow them to provide additional nutritious foods to families built around menus, recipes and educational activities.     	    	“Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre provides basic emergency food kits to hundreds of low-income families every week, and this investment will help us provide more nutritious foods to children and families in need,” said Diane Redsky, executive director, Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre. “We are very grateful for the province’s substantial investment, and we look forward to the direct and meaningful impacts this investment will have in the lives of our children and families.”   	    	“Andrews Street Family Centre has been providing 120 to 150 hot lunches to our community since COVID-19 began, and this pilot program will allow the centre to support another 50 to 60 families with nutritious food, learning material and menus,” said Dilly Knol, executive director, Andrews Street Family Centre. “Learning to cook together as a family through this pilot program may introduce different foods that families might not have purchased in the past. We hope this will lead to families buying and preparing more nutritious food together.”    	    	Participating families will receive packages of healthy foods along with recipes and learning activities that have been developed by the Child Nutrition Council of Manitoba. These educational resources will also be available online at a new website for all Manitobans, to support families as they spend time together learning about food, nutrition and meal preparation.   	    	“Learning to cook at home is an invaluable life skill,” said Stefanson. “Reading a recipe, measuring ingredients and making food together at home encourages literacy, numeracy and many other skills.

I encourage all Manitobans to join the conversation about accessibility issues this week to learn more about what we can do together to address and eliminate these challenges.”   	    	MAAW runs from June 14 to 20 and the focus this year is accessible employment and customer service during COVID-19. A free webinar will be co-hosted by the province’s Disabilities Issues Office (DIO), the Manitoba Employment Equity Practitioners Association (MEEPA) and Manitoba Possible on June 18 from 2 to 3 p.m., featuring remarks from the minister as well as the launch of a new training video focused on accessibility in the workplace.  Other topics will include:   	• accessibility during COVID-19 including employee safety, new accessibility requirements and accessing goods and services;    	• how to ensure an inclusive workplace by meeting Manitoba’s newest accessibility standard for employment;    	• tips, tools and resources for accessible employment and customer service; and   	• accessibility challenges and success stories during COVID-19.    	    	“We must all continue to take steps to ensure we are increasing accessibility for all our employees and customers,” said Marilyn Funk, co-chair, MEEPA. “During COVID-19, MEEPA reminds employers to consider both visible and invisible health conditions, like a compromised immune system, that may affect employees’ return to more regular operations. We are pleased to co-host the webinar to provide a focus on these important accessibility issues.”    	    	“We all benefit when businesses are willing to be flexible with employees and in how they offer their goods and services,” said Dana Erickson, CEO, Manitoba Possible. “For instance, Manitobans with disabilities and many others appreciate home delivery and virtual consultations as a way to create access, while maintaining social distance.”   	    	To register for the webinar, visit https://maaw2020accessiblemb.eventbrite.ca. Manitobans can also join the conversation about MAAW on social media by using #MAAW2020 and #AccessibleMB.  The province has developed a social media kit focused on MAAW and accessibility issues for individuals, community organizations and businesses. To download these resources, visit the DIO website at www.accessibilitymb.ca.    	    	New provisions under the province’s accessibility standard for employment came into effect for all organizations on May 1. Focused on employee safety, these provisions require all employers to have an emergency response plan for employees with disabilities and to develop a process to share information about individuals who may need help during an emergency with those who can provide assistance. Other provisions under the accessibility standard for employment will be phased in over the next two years.    	    	The minister noted the province provided $200 to lower-income Manitobans with disabilities last month to help address some of the financial challenges caused by COVID-19, as part of its expanded Manitoba Protection Plan.

The team will serve refugees and other immigrants, and include expertise and services from Shared Health, the Aurora Family Therapy Centre, Family Dynamics and Immigration Partnership Winnipeg as well as staff from Manitoba Adolescent Treatment Centre and the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.    	    	“This meaningful investment will make it easier for newcomers and refugees to access mental health services, heal from their trauma and lead productive lives,” said John Smyth, executive director, Aurora Family Therapy Centre. “We thank the Manitoba government for supporting such a unique and progressive approach to helping these communities.”   	    	Improved supports for newcomers with severe trauma will contribute to positive health and social outcomes. That includes reduced child welfare involvement, readiness for employment, reduced justice involvement and reduced gang-related activity.   	    	“Improving access to mental health programming will increase the likelihood that newcomers to our province can make a positive contribution,” said Justice Minister Cliff Cullen. “This investment will help those accessing these services make the right decisions, which will reduce crime rates in our communities.”   	    	This investment fulfils a recommendation made in the VIRGO report, which was to enhance and accelerate supports to deal with community-based substance use, addictions and mental health issues for newcomers and refugees, with a focus on post-trauma care.    	    	Funding for these initiatives is being provided under the Canada-Manitoba Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement. In the past eight months, the Manitoba government has committed $33.7 million toward 19 initiatives to improve mental health and addictions services throughout the province.    	    	- 30 -   	   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

Moore Hospital at Peguis First Nation, to supplement COVID-19 testing already being conducted at facilities throughout Manitoba’s north. The GeneXpert machine, which can provide test results in as little an hour, is already used in a number of Canadian jurisdictions to test for infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and influenza.   	    	“As part of our response to COVID-19, we continue to work closely with provinces and territories to prevent the spread of the virus. The Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory deployed the machines into these remote communities and will continue to provide COVID-19 testing support to them,” said Patty Hajdu, Canada’s Minister of Health.   	    	“Measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within northern communities have been a high priority since efforts to fight this virus within our province began several months ago,” said Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen. “This new equipment has the capability to provide a COVID-19 test result in about an hour and will be used to quickly confirm the presence of the virus in those patients who may require additional support to self-isolate.”    	    	Health-care providers will use the GeneXpert test kits for patients who may not be able to self-isolate easily if they test positive and therefore pose a higher risk of transmitting the virus. These may include patients who are experiencing multiple symptoms associated with COVID-19 or have other factors that put them at greater risk of contracting the virus. Northern Manitoba patients who do not fall within one of these categories will continue to follow the established process, which includes transport to Cadham and Dynacare labs for COVID-19 testing.   	    	“Residents throughout the north are to be commended for their vigilance in preventing the spread of this virus in our region,” said Dr. Michael Isaac, medical officer of health for the Northern Regional Health Authority. “Targeted rapid-response testing provides public health officials with another tool that will help us quickly suppress the spread of the virus if and when it reappears in our region.”    	    	The first three GeneXpert machines have been installed. Two are located at hospitals operated by Indigenous Services Canada in Norway House Cree Nation and Peguis First Nation, and one is on loan to Shared Health for operation at Thompson General Hospital. A fourth machine, destined for St. Anthony’s General Hospital in The Pas, is expected to be operational in the coming weeks.   	    	GeneXpert is a product manufactured in the United States and Canada receives a limited supply of devices based on the high demand for this product. As additional devices, cartridges and the necessary testing becomes available, phased expansion of GeneXpert testing can be considered on a broader scale.   	    	Since the beginning of the pandemic, a number of northern-specific initiatives have been launched to protect residents in Northern Manitoba from the spread of COVID-19 including travel restrictions and the opening of community testing sites in Thompson, Flin Flon and The Pas. To date, three people living in northern Manitoba had tested positive for COVID-19. All three have since recovered.

I am pleased to share with Manitobans the draft plan for Phase Three of Restoring Safe Services, and I encourage their input and advice as we move forward in our recovery efforts, together.”   	    	The draft plan for Phase Three of reopening the Manitoba economy is based on public health advice and consultation with key sectors. Proposed measures include:   	• increasing gathering sizes to up to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors;   	• developing guidelines for faith-based and other cultural gatherings, pow wows and other Indigenous cultural and spiritual gatherings, and small summer fairs and festivals;   	• easing border restrictions to allow residents of western Canada and northwest Ontario to enter Manitoba without the need to self-isolate for 14 days;   	• resuming regular licensed capacity for child-care centres with guidelines in place;   	• increasing group sizes for day camps from 24 children to 50;   	• increasing indoor occupancy levels for community/service centres and senior centres/clubs;   	• allowing people employed by or affiliated with a film production to enter Manitoba without    	self-isolating for 14 days;   	• allowing people employed by or affiliated with a professional sports team to enter Manitoba without self-isolating for 14 days;   	• removing occupancy limits for retail businesses while ensuring physical distancing measures are in place;   	• increasing indoor and patio occupancy limits to 75 per cent of total capacity for restaurants, bars, beverage rooms, brew pubs, microbreweries and distilleries; and   	• lifting occupancy limits for regulated and non-regulated health professions including registered massage therapists.   	    	Detailed information on the plan for Phase Three, including service restoration, measures the public can take to reduce their risk of COVIC-19 exposure or spreading the virus, and workplace guidance for businesses, can be found at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices.   	    	“As we reopen the economy, we will have to adjust to some level of risk and each person has to decide the level of risk they are willing to accept,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public heath officer. “All Manitobans, especially those choosing to resume some activities, must remember to practise good hand hygiene, not to share items with others and practise physical distancing when with others outside their households.”    	    	Roussin also noted it is key for people to stay home if they are sick to further reduce the risk of spreading the virus.   	    	The province continues to encourage businesses to take steps to help staff, customers and visitors stay safe including:   	• ensuring people are able to reasonably maintain two metres of distance;   	• only conducting necessary and brief exchanges within two metres of others;   	• applying enhanced cleaning protocols, especially in common areas like washrooms;   	• maintaining physical distancing and food-handling protocols in workplace areas including lunch and common areas;   	• ensuring staff stay home when feeling sick; and   	• following personal risk reduction measures.   	    	“While we can take pride in the progress we’ve made and the additional steps we are considering today, we must remain vigilant,” Pallister said. “If public health results deteriorate or guidelines are not sufficient, Phase Three measures may be paused and previous measures may be re-introduced.

The economic stimulus package adds an additional $500 million above the $3-billion infrastructure investment in Budget 2020.    	    	Projects selected include pre-existing provincial and municipal priorities, and waste and water projects. The $500 million will be allocated over two years as follows:   	• $230 million earmarked for the provincial share of projects under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP), a cost-sharing, application-based program with the federal government;   	• $150 million for asphalt highway resurfacing;   	• $50 million for the Water Services Board to address the significant backlog of water and sewer projects across Manitoba;   	• $65 million for major projects that will improve the safety of Manitoba’s highways; and    	• $5 million on municipal law enforcement priorities including local jails to alleviate pressure on the Winnipeg Remand Centre.   	    	Pallister noted project goals include increasing clean drinking water, reducing boil water advisories and advancing clean sewer projects. The province will reveal further details of its prioritized ICIP project applications in the weeks and months ahead as it works with other levels of government and Indigenous partners, and it will use the $230 million set aside for ICIP to leverage additional dollars through federal and municipal government sharing.    	    	Once Ottawa approves final ICIP projects, the premier noted the province is prepared to immediately advance funds to municipal partners to allow planning and construction to commence without delay. Other construction projects announced today, such as highways and Water Services Board projects, will be put out to tender in the coming weeks.   	    	The premier also announced today, as part of the initial $3 billion worth of infrastructure investments in Budget 2020, the province has allocated $91 million in total capital investment on construction improvements to the Trans-Canada Highway (PTH 1) across Manitoba. Projects include:    	• road reconstruction on the westbound lanes from the Brokenhead River to PTH 11;   	• road reconstruction on the eastbound lanes from Provincial Road (PR) 248 to the east junction of PTH 26;   	• road rehabilitation on the eastbound lanes from 3.4 kilometres west of PTH 83 to PR 257; and   	• structure replacement at the Assiniboine River 13.2 km east of Portage la Prairie.   	    	“Our number one priority is to ensure the health and well-being of all Manitobans, and we are working to make the Trans-Canada Highway safer from border to border,” said Pallister. “Investments in Highway 1 help ensure the safe and continued movement of people and economic goods across the province. We are also rejuvenating and planting additional shelterbelts to help improve safety and reduce road closures between Portage la Prairie and Winnipeg.”    	    	Pallister announced the province is providing up to $2.5 million in funding for Trans-Canada Shelterbelt Renewal Project through the Growing Outcomes in Watersheds (GROW) Trust program. The province is working with the Manitoba Habitat Heritage Corporation (MHHC) to restore and add to 16 km of shelterbelts on the north side of the Trans-Canada Highway from St. François Xavier to Elie, and west of the PTH 430 intersection.    	    	“It is exciting to take on a project that uses trees to directly protect the well-being of Manitobans,” said Tim Sopuck, chief executive officer, MHHC. “These shelterbelts will also sequester carbon and help to slow spring run-off.”    	    	The project will plant approximately 20,000 new trees and shrubs, sourced from Manitoba nurseries, and employ a Manitoba tree-planting company. The project, expected to be complete in 2022, will be one of Canada’s largest road-related shelterbelt planting initiatives.   	    	- 30 -   	   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED   	   "

The organization offering the housing also provides ongoing support for tenants to fulfil their post-treatment plan including gaining employment or going back to school. Currently there are only seven organizations providing supportive long-term programs in Manitoba to approximately 174 individuals annually.   	    	“We are grateful to the Province of Manitoba for helping to fund the 20 supportive recovery units in our old office space at 300 Princess,” said Jim Bell, CEO of Siloam Mission. “This endeavour fits in perfectly with the mental health programs and the other services we offer, and will enable us to help more people transition back into community.”   	    	The province will provide financing for one-time capital costs and operating funding. Siloam Mission will develop 20 units, Riverwood Church Community Inc. will develop 40 units at Riverwood House in Elmwood and Tamarack Recovery Inc. will develop 10 units.   	    	The organizations were selected based on submissions issued last fall, which focus on expanding system capacity for rehabilitative supports in both urban and rural areas, and address the increasing demand for services.   	    	“The Riverwood House Project Team is grateful for the vision the province has to find creative solutions, and we are committed to seeing this investment provide much-needed housing and supports to empower people to move toward full recovery and healthy integration into the community,” said Jon Courtney with Riverwood House.   	    	The $2.1-million investment will allow the organizations to develop program-based housing solutions providing on-site support services with a goal of all units being operational by March 31, 2021.    	    	“This exciting opportunity means that we can expand our efforts to serve Manitobans seeking long-term recovery from addictions by providing tailored transitional housing support for individuals during the critical post-treatment period in a safe, welcoming and supportive environment,” said Lisa Cowan, executive director, Tamarack Recovery Centre.   	    	Studies show supportive recovery housing is an effective option for those in need of alcohol and drug-free housing accommodations, and improves success rates for addictions treatment.    	    	Recommendations from the VIRGO and the Illicit Drug Task Force reports both identify the need to add supportive recovery housing units to help meet demand for the service. Funding will be provided through the Canada-Manitoba Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement.    	    	The minister noted the government has invested more than $31.6 million to improve access to mental health and addictions treatment including $3.5 million for the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre, an investment to expand Project 11, and a pilot project to provide mental health and addictions services to families at risk of child apprehension.   	    	“We are pleased to work in collaboration with community partners to directly support those recovering from addictions,” said Friesen. “We will continue to build on our front-line services to ensure access to needed addictions treatment and health-care services in Manitoba.”   	    	- 30 -   	   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

These changes required teamwork from a wide variety of our partners within the criminal justice system and were accomplished in a very short period of time.   	    	The Winnipeg Police Service and Brandon Police Service played a key role in implementing these revised procedures, and we thank them for their efforts during these challenging times. There has not been a single case of COVID-19 in our Manitoba correctional facilities to date, and we are appreciative of all the modifications that our justice staff and police agencies have made in response to the pandemic.   	    	Not only did these swift measures protect our staff and inmates from a COVID outbreak, they also brought us in line with procedures in virtually every other Canadian jurisdiction. These changes ensure that people have appeared before a judicial officer prior to admission to a provincial correctional facility, which is how the process works in all other provinces.   	    	All divisions of Manitoba Justice are committed to working with the Winnipeg Police Service to support them in their responsibilities as the arresting agency and we will continue to work to ensure that no one remains in police custody longer than necessary.   	    	While our government flows more than $200 million annually to Manitoba’s police agencies, including nearly $20 million for the Winnipeg Police Service, we also support public safety through a wide variety of community-based measures, some of which were announced as recently as this week.    	    	On Monday, we announced an investment of nearly $3 million in the Thompson Sobering Centre, the latest in a series of this government’s investments to meet better the needs of Manitobans struggling with mental health and addiction concerns. Since October 2019, our government has announced 18 initiatives valued at more than $31.6 million to improve mental health and addictions services throughout Manitoba.    	    	We have invested approximately $1 million into Community Mobilization hubs that help connect social service professionals and community agencies with at-risk youth and families to ensure they are receiving appropriate and timely supports and interventions.    	    	Our government has also made significant investments in restorative justice initiatives, helping divert more than 5,000 matters out of the criminal justice system to be resolved through restorative justice and diversion programs.    	    	We have increased by $400,000 support for restorative justice programming, and in March, I was proud to launch ‘Restorative Justice North’, a pilot project in partnership with the Manitoba Metis Federation and Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak.     	    	While we have already made some progress, we recognize there is more work ahead, and we will continue to invest in these important supports to help protect the safety and well-being of Manitobans.   	    	- 30 -   	   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

We need to maintain these historic structures to help future generations learn about our province’s rich and diverse history.”   	   Our Way Forward: Manitoba’s Culture Policy and Action Plan prioritizes supporting culture in communities and everyday life in addition to modernizing cultural funding programs. The Heritage Resource Conservation Trust was established in 2019 through a $15-million contribution to The Winnipeg Foundation. The annual resources from the endowment fund will ensure that heritage conservation projects are supported in perpetuity.    	    	One of the projects receiving funding is the historic Fraser Block in Brandon, with a grant totalling nearly $22,000 to help with repairs to the building, including the sandstone façade, the minister said. Built in 1890, the Fraser Block was one of the first substantial business buildings outside Winnipeg and it helped Brandon’s early advancement as a commercial centre.    	    	“We are thankful the Province of Manitoba recognizes the importance of preserving heritage buildings because these structures are a visible reminder of our collective past as Manitobans,” said Robyn Sneath, president of the Sneath Group. “By locating our business in a heritage building in Brandon's historic downtown, our goal is to create a unique destination experience for Manitobans, one that blends the past with the present.”     	    	The majority of program receiving investments through the Heritage Resource Conservation Trust target repairs and upgrades, but also include research and building assessments. Grants range from several hundred dollars up to $25,000, depending on the size and scope of the project. Additional projects will be announced in the coming weeks, the minister added.   	    	The Heritage Resources Conservation Grant supports projects that demonstrate a commitment toward the conservation and long-term sustainability of heritage resources that are legally protected under The Heritage Resources Act. Categories for grant application include capital projects, research, conservation planning, education or training, and endowments.   	    	For more information on this program, visit www.gov.mb.ca/chc/grants/heritage_hrcg.html.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

The goal of Restorative Justice North is to increase the use of diversion options in Thompson and resolve conflicts in a more timely way.    	    	Earlier this year, the province announced a $35,000 grant for the City of Thompson to work with a consultant and develop a community safety and well-being strategy.

The gradual easing of visitor restrictions will restore the ability for patients and their loved ones to visit while measures to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 within Manitoba’s hospitals remain in place.   	    	“Connecting with family members, loved ones and support systems are an important part of the healing process for someone in the hospital. During the peak of the pandemic, in-person visits had to be limited as we took every necessary step to prevent the spread of this virus,” said Friesen. “With the co-operation of Manitobans, our COVID-19 response has been successful and we are now pleased to be in a position to allow in-person visits to occur.”    	    	This expanded visitor access follows the successful introduction of outdoor visits at Manitoba’s personal care homes last week, the minister noted, adding Manitoba’s hospitals and health centres have also been tasked with finding ways to accommodate outdoor visits following the trial earlier this week at Victoria General Hospital.    	    	All visitors must comply with infection prevention and control measures, which includes strict hand hygiene and maintaining physical distancing (six feet/two metres apart) at all times.    	    	“We recognize that solitude and separation can have a significant and negative impact on a patient’s health and well-being. Our goal is to find a balance for the longer-term; a balance that will enable visits with loved ones to occur, with all necessary precautions in place,” said Friesen.   	    	Friesen indicated the likelihood of COVID-19 being a part of the ‘new normal’ for a longer duration requires finding a longer-term balance between preventative measures and the many benefits of in-person interaction between patients and their loved ones.   	    	Most patients will be eligible to identify a single designated support person who may visit daily. Most sites are expected to be up and running between Friday and Monday, the minister noted. Facilities will begin implementation as early as June 5, with all sites expected to welcome designated support people as visitors by the week of June 8.    	    	For current information on COVID-19 in Manitoba, such as steps people can take to reduce their risk and workplace guidance for businesses, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.    	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:  https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.    	    	- 30 -   	   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

The province will invest $16 million to convert Provincial Road (PR) 246 from gravel to asphalt from PTH 23 near Morris to PR 205 near Aubigny, which will allow traffic to be rerouted around sections of PTH 75 that are most prone to closure.   	    	“Creating a safe, flood-proof route as an alternative to PTH 75 means Manitoba can stay open for business in times of high water and keep goods moving from the United States,” said Pallister. “The continued flow of commercial traffic along the north-south corridor is critical to Manitoba’s economy, and by making careful, financially responsible decisions, we can ensure these goods continue to make their way to market.”    	    	Since 1996, PTH 75 has been closed approximately once every four years for an average of 24 days, the premier noted. The upgrades will create a flood-proof route from the United States border at Emerson to CentrePort Canada in Winnipeg.   	    	The premier also announced today an additional $17 million investment for six projects that help build Manitoba’s climate resilience:   	• Rural Municipality (RM) of Montcalm – St. Mary’s Road improvement project;    	• RM of Rhineland – GNS east pump house expansion;   	• St. Pierre-Jolys – berm construction;   	• RM of Wallace – Woodworth – Elkhorn lagoon and lift station upgrade;   	• RM of Wallace – Woodworth – Kenton supply wells generator backup; and   	• Altona – downtown drainage upgrade project.   	    	“The province is funding 100 per cent of these projects to help support the long-term sustainability of our communities and it is an additional way we are helping municipal governments weather the storm from the pandemic,” Pallister said. “These projects build on previous commitments to municipalities including our recent announcement of $10 million in Building Sustainable Communities grants to support 344 projects for community development projects and nearly doubling this year’s investment in Green Team projects.”   	    	The $33-million commitment is part of the province’s one-time capital investment in damage prevention and climate resiliency measures announced in November 2019. Stakeholder consultation continues to identify projects in the capital region and additional projects will be announced in the coming months, the premier noted.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

Stakeholders selected a program that will provide a one-time, income-tested payment to eligible low-income front-line workers, with consideration given to the added risk due to COVID-19 and interaction with the public including clients, patients and inmates. Eligible public- and private-sector positions include the areas of health care, social services, justice, transportation and essential retail, food and beverage.    	    	“I want to thank these organizations, representing more than Manitoba 17,000 businesses and 110,000 workers, for providing valuable input and reaching a consensus on how best to administer risk recognition payments,” said Pallister. “Based on their feedback, we will implement a program to recognize and thank workers who played a key role in our provincial pandemic response efforts and made sacrifices in their professional and personal lives to protect all Manitobans, especially those most vulnerable.”   	    	Eligible categories include store shelf stockers, retail salespersons, cashiers, cooks, security guards, light-duty cleaners in retail facilities, early childhood educators, licensed home-based child-care providers, family violence shelter workers, social workers, nurses and nurse practitioners, paramedics, health-care aides, community services workers (including personal care homes, home care, public health, mental health and addictions), direct service workers for adults and children with disabilities, law enforcement (including Winnipeg Police Service, Brandon Police Service and RCMP), correctional officers, long-distance truck drivers and bus drivers.   	    	The payment is available to workers employed on a part-time or full-time basis from March 20 (the start of the provincial state of emergency) until May 29, who either worked a minimum 200 cumulative hours (or would have worked that amount but were required to self-isolate under public health orders).

Development that affects the highly connected flow of water through these wetlands can have both upstream and downstream effects on biodiversity, habitat, and carbon sequestration capacity. However, these impacts can be managed, controlled and offset through best practices.   	    	These codes of practice provide certainty for resource developers by providing guidance about where and how to operate within and around boreal wetlands on Crown lands, said Pedersen.   	    	“Boreal wetlands are some of the most carbon-rich ecosystems in the world, which also provide critical habitat for a variety of wildlife and species at risk,” said Karla Guyn, chief executive officer, Ducks Unlimited Canada. “The Boreal Wetlands Conservation Codes of Practice is an important step in safeguarding these natural areas, and Ducks Unlimited Canada is pleased to have been part of the committee that contributed to their development.”   	    	Developed through a committee of government, industry, environmental non-governmental organizations, and with the guidance of an Indigenous advisor, the Boreal Wetlands Conservation Codes of Practice contribute to the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan, and will help conserve, responsibly manage and protect these valuable wetland ecosystems.    	    	Copies of the Boreal Wetlands Conservation Codes of Practices can be found at:   http://gov.mb.ca/sd/pubs/forestry_peatlands/boreal_codes_practice.pdf.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

The Province of Manitoba has had a great response from both students and employers, and there is room for a lot more. Since the launch, more than 2,300 students have created profiles and submitted over 2,100 job applications.    	    	As well, more than 100 employers have posted 230 available jobs for students. The Department of Economic Development and Training has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from employers and students on how user-friendly and secure the site is. This tool will support Manitobans as we move toward Phase Two of the government’s Restoring Safe Services strategy on Monday.     	    	Student Jobs MB is a complement to the successful Student Summer Jobs Recovery Program. More than 830 employers have applied to the Student Summer Jobs Recovery Program, making 1,929 positions available since it was launched on April 24 as part of the Manitoba government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Employers have told the government that because of this wage subsidy program, they are able to hire more students and meet some of the increasing demands for their services. This is good news for students, employers and all Manitobans.     	    	I am confident the continued success of these two programs will help Manitoba rebuild its workforce and economy during these challenging times.   	    	- 30 -  "

Businesses will now have up to three additional months to remit retail sales taxes and the Health and Post Secondary Education Tax Levy, commonly called the payroll tax.    	    	Fielding noted in the last two months, deferred retail sales and payroll tax deferrals resulted in an estimated $10.8 million savings to Manitoba businesses.    	    	The province is continuing to postpone non-urgent eviction hearings and suspending any rent increases scheduled to take effect in June. The Residential Tenancies Branch (RTB) and Residential Tenancies Commission (RTC) will continue to postpone all hearings for non-urgent matters to halt evictions, and all scheduled hearings are delayed to protect Manitobans from evictions during the pandemic, with certain exceptions to deal with urgent issues that involve the health and safety of tenants. Eviction orders will only be issued to address issues affecting health and safety including unlawful activities.   	    	“We continue to balance safety concerns with support for renters facing economic hardship or needing to self isolate due to COVID-19,” said Fielding. “The Residential Tenancies Branch remains available to resolve urgent situations involving health and safety for landlords and tenants.”   	    	Fielding noted the RTB also recognizes landlords are experiencing financial challenges as some tenants are unable to pay full rent. After June 30, the branch plans to schedule hearings to adjudicate landlord applications for orders of possession on a priority basis. Hearings will be scheduled based on the order in which the applications are received. Landlords and tenants are encouraged to contact the RTB for information by telephone at 204-945-2476 or (toll-free) at 1-800-782-8403 and by email at rtb@gov.mb.ca.   	    	Information on filing requirements is available at www.gov.mb.ca/finance/taxation/bulletins.html.      	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:   https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.    	    	- 30 -  "

The Conservation Trust was established in 2018 with a $102 million contribution to The Winnipeg Foundation that established an endowment fund to generate annual revenues for conservation projects in perpetuity. Two additional Trusts, the GROW Trust and the Wetlands GROW Trust, have also been created, bringing Manitoba’s total investment in these trusts to $204 million.   	    	Activities funded by the Conservation Trust include conserving biodiversity, mitigating floods and droughts, supporting climate-change mitigation through carbon sequestration, improving soil health, preserving waterways and decreasing soil erosion.    	    	“Investing in projects that preserve our environment cannot wait as they play a vital role in combating climate change,” Pedersen noted. “Due to the innovative approach and the permanent endowment we have created, the Conservation Trust’s revenues ensure we are able to invest in worthy projects year after year, no matter the financial pressures Manitoba faces.”   	    	The first round of Conservation Trust Funding for 2020 include:   	• Inter-Mountain Watershed District’s Streambank Stabilization Project on Turtle River ($147,500) – The community-based watershed district is working to reduce soil erosion and restore riparian habitats along the Turtle River as outlined in the Dauphin Lake Integrated Watershed Management Plan.   	• Fort Whyte Alive’s Open Spaces Enhancement Project ($40,000) – Fort Whyte Alive provides opportunities for Manitobans to connect with nature and understand the importance of the environment to everyone’s well-being.

Manitoba Education will continue planning and consulting with school divisions and other education stakeholders, the premier noted.   	    	The plan for Phase Two was revised from the original draft document, released May 21, based on input from the public and businesses, as well as additional input from public health officials. Changes include:   	• detailed guidance for post-secondary educational institutions and vocational colleges;   	• removing occupancy limits for therapeutic and health-care services;    	• detailed guidance for senior’s clubs;   	• additional details on requirements for the safe operation of splash pads;   	• updated guidance for community centres;   	• the reopening of arts and cultural activities, such as dance, art and theatre;   	• clarifications on the opening of bars, beverage rooms, brew pubs, micro-brewers and distilleries to allow sites that do not serve food to open, as well as updated guidance from public health that all patrons must be seated at tables and stand-up service is not allowed; and   	• detailed public health guidelines for film productions.   	    	A number of measures initially outlined in the draft plan for Phase Two can resume effective June 1 including:    	• increasing child-care centre occupancy to up to 24 children plus staffing;   	• increasing day camp group sizes to 24;   	• resuming sports, arts and cultural activities for children and adults;   	• lifting occupancy limits at outdoor recreation facilities and golf courses outdoors, as long as physical distancing can be maintained and allowing limited access to indoor spaces;   	• allowing direct travel to northern parks, campgrounds, cabins, lodges and resorts while ensuring physical distancing;   	• allowing public/private swimming pools, spas, fitness clubs, gyms and community/service centres to reopen with some limitations;   	• allowing religious or other organizations to hold outdoor services or events without limitation on numbers if people stay in their vehicles;   	• reopening manicurists and pedicurists, tattoo parlours, estheticians, cosmetologists, electrologists and tanning parlours at 50 per cent capacity;   	• allowing restaurants to reopen indoor spaces at 50 per cent capacity and continue to offer patio services at that capacity level; and   	• allowing bars, beverage rooms, micro-brewers and similar businesses to operate patio service at 50 per cent of site capacity and to reopen indoor spaces at 50 per cent capacity.   	    	No changes will be made to the requirements for reopening museums, galleries and libraries, and parks, campgrounds yurts and vacation cabins.   	    	Detailed information on the plan for Phase Two of service restoration and steps people can take to reduce their risk and workplace guidance for businesses can be found at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices.   	    	Other changes that came into effect on May 22 included increasing gathering sizes to 25 people indoors and 50 people outdoors, and allowing professional sports teams to resume practicing.   	    	“Case numbers and positive test rates continue to be low and other key factors are also positive,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “These additional steps to safely restore services will help ease the impacts on Manitobans and ensure the health system continues to be able to respond if case numbers increase slightly.”   	    	Mass gatherings such as concerts, festivals and major sporting events will not be considered before September 2020, Roussin noted. He also noted that it is key for people to stay home if they are sick to further reduce the risk of spreading the virus.   	    	Roussin continued to encourage businesses to take steps to help staff, patrons and visitors stay safe including:   	• ensuring people are able to reasonably maintain two metres of distance;   	• only conducting necessary and brief exchanges within two metres of others;   	• applying enhanced cleaning protocols, especially in common areas like washrooms;   	• maintaining physical distancing and food-handling protocols in workplace areas including lunch and common areas;   	• staying home when feeling sick; and   	• following personal risk reduction measures.   	    	Manitoba businesses can submit questions about how the plan applies to them by visiting https://engagemb.ca.    	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:  https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

Since March 30, Manitobans have submitted more than 8,300 questions or survey forms on the pandemic response. Pallister noted the input received will continue to help public health officials refine plans going forward.   	    	From the May 21 survey, 77 per cent of respondents said they definitely or somewhat agree that Phase One of Manitoba’s roadmap was an appropriate, well-considered first step in restoring services safely in the province. Respondents cited the routine briefings by Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, and other officials as the most helpful source of information.     	    	“Our plan to gradually open additional businesses is being made in careful consultation with our public health experts and taking into account the experiences and concerns of Manitobans,” said Pallister. “We rely on all Manitobans, from front-line workers to the business community to those receiving our services, to let us know their thoughts on how best to safely expand available services, while maintaining physical distancing measures and other considerations of our health and well-being.”   	    	Along with the opportunity to provide online feedback through http://EngageMB.ca, the province hosted three public telephone town halls, which had nearly 52,000 participants from across the province.    	    	Roussin and Manitoba’s cabinet ministers have participated in several stakeholder meetings with hundreds of attendees who represent those in the education, child-care and business sectors, as well as virtual town halls with the Winnipeg and Manitoba chambers of commerce.    	    	For those who wish to participate in the survey, visit:  https://engagemb.ca/restoring-safe-services-phase-two.    	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:  https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.   	    	For up-to-date information on Manitoba’ COVID-19 response, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

The facility will be expanded and renovated over time to become a school for Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine (DSFM), which will use it for approximately 350 students from kindergarten to Grade 8.    	    	“This represents a true win-win opportunity, and is a credit to the officials at Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine and Gateway Christian Community Inc. who have been creative in putting the needs of their students first,” said Goertzen. “With its planned improvements, the school building will fill a high demand for French-language education in northeast Winnipeg.”   	    	The purchase of The King’s School and its upcoming expansion and renovations for DSFM will cost the province approximately $13.5 million, which is about $8.7 million less than it would cost to construct a new school, Goertzen noted.   	    	During the transition period, the province and DSFM have agreed to allow existing classes to continue at The King’s School until construction of a new facility for Gateway Christian Community Inc. in West St. Paul is complete. At the same time, DSFM will establish school programming in northeast Winnipeg.    	    	“The school in northeast Winnipeg marks an important step forward in creating new learning spaces for our francophone communities,” said Bernard Lesage, president, Commission Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine. “The newly acquired school will allow us to better welcome our current and future students so we can continue to provide them with a quality French-language education in their neighbourhood.”    	    	The temporary joint use of The King’s School will require minor renovations to the facility during the summer of 2020 and an installation of four temporary modular classrooms for use by its students until June 30, 2022, when DSFM will fully take over the space.   	    	“We are excited to partner with the French school division to see this property continue to serve the needs of the community,” said Peter Todd, pastoral team leader, Panet Road congregation of Gateway Church.   	    	“This is a great arrangement that will see Gateway Christian Community Inc. and The King’s School continue to offer educational, community and faith-based programming at the site for the duration of the shared-use agreement,” said Goertzen. “DSFM will recruit students to its newly acquired school, initially focusing on kindergarten and Grade 1 this fall.”   	    	The province is working toward the construction of 20 new schools within the next 10 years across Manitoba. This commitment comes with a heightened investment in school construction and will give more students from kindergarten to Grade 12 the opportunity to learn at the best possible facilities, the minister noted.   	    	- 30 -  "

Public consultations are currently being held on the practice of paramedicine regulation.    	    	The valued contributions our paramedics make every day is appreciated, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when they are often the first point of contact for Manitobans in need.    	    	I want to thank Manitoba’s paramedics for being true health-care heroes as they put their own health and safety on the line to care for others across the province.

This includes the introduction of a new controlled-access licence for retailers. Manitoba will also continue to offer age-restricted licences for retailers wishing to open stand-alone stores.     	To become a retailer, applicants will be required to successfully complete the required application process, enter into a Cannabis Store Retailer Agreement with Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries, and be issued an applicable licence from the Liquor, Gaming and Cannabis Authority of Manitoba.   	The minister noted that one location per applicant will be processed at a time and new entrants to the Manitoba market will be prioritized.    	There are currently 30 stores with age-restricted licences in Manitoba. Retailers in this next phase will be limited to owning no more than 15 per cent of stand-alone stores in Manitoba. This will be expanded as more stores enter the market.   	“COVID-19 has presented challenges for all Manitobans, including local businesses,” said Wharton. “In launching this third phase of our retail strategy, we are keeping our promise to build a competitive cannabis retail environment and supporting Manitoba’s economic recovery.”   	For more information or to apply, prospective retailers are encouraged to visit: www.mbllpartners.ca/cannabis-partners/become-cannabis-retailer.   	    	- 30 -  	   "

Understanding the patterns and trends of COVID-19 transmission is an important component of Manitoba’s reopening strategy and will inform the gradual lifting of public health restrictions and other elements of the province’s COVID-19 response. Manitoba has developed several options for sentinel testing including introducing voluntary asymptomatic testing for clients in a number of health-care settings to further monitor the presence of COVID-19 in the province.   	Manitobans who present for non-COVID-19 related care may be offered the testing as part of sentinel surveillance.

Hunting guides play a critical role in the delivery of outfitted guiding experiences. The Guide License Program provides those seeking an outfitter a degree of assurance the hired guide has a specific set of knowledge and skills. The transfer of the Guide License Program to the Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association will expedite licence issuance to hunting guides while reducing government red tape.   	Once transitioned, the Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association will review and assess licence applications, administer examinations for guides and issue hunting guide licences on behalf of the minister of agriculture and resource development. Further information on the transfer will be available at a later date, and hunting guides should continue to apply for renewed and new licences through the existing process.   	“The Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association is thrilled to take on the administration of the hunting guide license program,” said Brian Kotak, executive director of the Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association. “In continued collaboration with Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development, we look forward to enhancing the license program to deliver quality training for our existing and new guides, creating more professional guides who offer world-class service and hunting experiences in Manitoba.”  For more information on the Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association, visit https://mloa.com/.   	- 30 -  "

To ensure students are equipped to transition to the new school year, additional teaching days are being examined for the upcoming school year, including starting schools on Aug. 31, and repurposing some of the non-instructional days throughout the school year, the premier noted.   	“Our young Manitobans are our most precious asset, and we need to do everything we can to support students and help prepare them for a bright future,” said Pallister. “We know this has been a challenging time for students and their families as they juggle remote learning while missing their classmates and friends. We want to examine additional ways to assist them in meeting their educational needs.”   	The Department of Education will continue planning and consulting with school divisions and other education stakeholders, the premier noted.   	The draft plan for restoring services in Phase Two builds on measures Restoring Safe Services:  Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap for Recovery, which set out an evidence-based plan to ease public health measures that had escalated since mid-January.   	Others being examined for the second phase of service restoration include:  	•    increasing child-care centre occupancy to up to 24 children plus staffing;  	•    increasing day camp group sizes to 24;  	•    resuming sports activities for children and adults;  	•    lifting occupancy limits at outdoor recreation facilities and golf courses outdoors, as long as physical distancing can be maintained and allowing limited access to indoor spaces;  	•    allowing direct travel to northern parks, campgrounds, cabins, lodges and resorts while ensuring physical distancing;  	•    allowing public/private swimming pools, spas, fitness clubs, gyms and community/service centres to reopen with some limitations;  	•    allowing religious or other organizations to hold outdoor services without limitation on numbers if people stay in their vehicles;  	•    reopening manicurists and pedicurists, tattoo parlours, estheticians, cosmetologists, electrologists and tanning parlours at 50 per cent capacity;  	•    allowing restaurants to reopen indoor spaces at 50 per cent capacity and continue to offer patio services at that capacity level;  	•    allowing bars, beverage rooms, micro-brewers and similar businesses that serve food and drinks to operate patio service at 50 per cent of site capacity and to reopen indoor spaces at 50 per cent capacity; and  	•    allowing the resumption of film productions while ensuring physical distancing.   	Other changes include the increasing gathering sizes to 25 people indoors and 50 people outdoors, and allowing residents of personal care homes and long-term care facilities to have visits outdoors. These changes will come into effect on May 22.   	No changes were made to the requirements for reopening hair stylists/barbers, museums, galleries and libraries and parks, campgrounds yurts and vacation cabins.   	“We look at a number of key factors when making these recommendations including how the spread of the virus has been controlled, the stability of the health system’s capacity, public health capacity and the number of outbreaks in vulnerable settings,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “We will only take additional steps to safely restore services based on this data, as well as on case numbers, testing data and other public health information. Any further changes will be considered based on this data in the coming days and weeks.”   	Mass gatherings such as concerts, festivals and major sporting events will not be considered before September 2020, Roussin noted. He also noted that it is key for people to stay home if they are sick to further reduce the risk of spreading the virus.   	Roussin also encouraged businesses to take steps to help staff, patrons and visitors stay safe including:  	•    ensuring people are able to reasonably maintain two metres of distance;  	•    only conducting necessary and brief exchanges within two metres of others;  	•    applying enhanced cleaning protocols, especially in common areas like washrooms;  	•    maintaining physical distancing and food-handling protocols in workplace areas including lunch and common areas;  	•    staying home when feeling sick; and  	•    following personal risk reduction measures.

A new or existing business interested in getting established or expanding in Manitoba may apply to the program if:    	• the business is prepared to make a minimum capital investment of $10 million to a specific property, which will be designated for tax increment financing benefits;    	• a minimum of 65 per cent of total project costs are from private sources; and    	• there is demonstrable potential to create and/or maintain jobs in Manitoba, or the new business activity will have a substantial and measurable net economic benefit to the province.   	    	The first project to be announced under the program will lever a potential $392-million private capital investment and create 450 new jobs to redevelop the Portage Place mall in downtown Winnipeg, through a rebate of up to $28.7 million over 20 years. The Starlight Developments project will convert Portage Place into a mixed-use complex that includes student housing as well as larger-family Indigenous student housing, retail and services, and will transform its street presence to become more connected to the surrounding area while increasing safety.   	    	The Manitoba Works Capital Incentive carries no risk in that it provides no up-front money to the developer, and the province pays only what is collected in incremental education property tax as a result of the development.    	    	Historically, Manitoba used TIF to promote investment in community revitalization projects, among other uses. In December 2018, the province began refocusing the program toward economic development and moving to increase transparency with a whole-of-government approach to project reviews. The new Manitoba Works Capital Incentive framework provides clear parameters and aligns with the province’s mandate to champion Manitoba as an ideal location for business investment and expansion.     	    	The government has committed to phase out education property tax in order to relieve property owners of this burden and to align Manitoba with other provinces. Rebates provided through the Manitoba Works Capital Incentive will support significant development during the phase-out period and will provide a competitive tax advantage to stimulate economic growth, the minister added.   	    	- 30 -   	   "

Through Manitoba Hydro, the province owns thousands of kilometres of fibre-optic cable across the province. The network was created to communicate with northern hydroelectric facilities and transmit data. However, much of it has never been used, with no plans for use in the future.   	“By allowing qualified carriers and providers to tap into this fibre-optic capacity, we will make use of an existing resource rather than building new infrastructure,” said Wharton. “This network will allow providers to offer or improve service to the significant number of rural and remote communities in Manitoba that are largely underserved by high-speed, competitive and reliable telecommunications.”   	The province plans to work with these assets and a qualified telecommunications company (or companies) to:  	•    improve access to broadband and support further implementation of technologies that are capable of evolving to ‘next generation’ to keep pace with growing data needs; and  	•    improve cellular service across long stretches of transportation corridors and in communities that are currently without cellular service, which poses a safety risk to Manitobans.   	Manitoba issued a request for qualifications (RFQ) last fall to seek carriers and other providers who could use existing infrastructure to make services available in communities across rural and northern Manitoba. The RFQ was used to pre-qualify and create a shortlist of up to five proponents, who are assisting the province in defining the scope and scale of this opportunity and informing the planned RFP.     	The province is preparing the RFP and plans to post it in late spring or early summer, the minister noted.   	- 30 -  "

This is especially important in public areas, such as campgrounds, trails, beaches, playgrounds, washrooms and shower buildings.   	Frequent cleaning and sanitization of washrooms and shower facilities within provincial parks will be in place to ensure visitors have a safe and positive experience. However, campers are asked to bring their own supplies, including items such as soap, sanitizer, hygiene products and toilet paper, to campgrounds, yurts and cabins. They are also reminded to pack required prescription drugs and medical supplies, and water shoes or sandals for use in shower facilities.   	Campers should buy their park entry passes online ahead of time and be sure to print their campground reservation. At this time, to limit personal contact, reservation holders can proceed directly to their campsite when they arrive. Walk-up customers will still need to check in at the camp office.   	A reminder that gatherings of more than 10 people are not permitted at this time and is best to limit interactions to people within your own household. This includes socializing with neighbouring sites.   	Manitobans who feel unwell should stay at home, and return home immediately if they feel ill or experience symptoms that may be COVID-19 related.  Do not use local health providers unless it is an emergency. In addition, travel is not permitted from southern Manitoba to areas, including campgrounds, north of the 53rd parallel. This is essentially anywhere north of the northern edge of Lake Winnipeg.   	Due to the cool spring, some campgrounds may not have all the usual amenities operational this weekend. There is still a lot of snow on the ground at Paint Lake, Wekusko Falls and Grass River campgrounds, so nightly camping will not be available yet. However, the yurts at Paint Lake will be open. Water lines are not ready yet in Big Whiteshell Provincial Campground, which affects modern washrooms and showers. Water will be available from a water tank at the campground office.   	Key reminders of what is different in Manitoba campgrounds and cottage country at this time:  	•    buy provincial park entry passes online before leaving home;  	•    print campground reservation confirmations and go directly to the reserved site;  	•    practise social distancing;  	•    no gatherings of more than 10 people;  	•    bring supplies of hygiene items such as soap and toilet paper;  	•    pack out trash when leaving; and  	•    no travel from southern Manitoba to north of the 53rd parallel.   	Conservation officers and park patrol officers will be enforcing the emergency public health orders within provincial parks. Campground attendants and park staff will also provide education and monitor compliance.  	   	Cottagers are reminded to limit the number of additional contacts made as part of their trip. Gather supplies and fuel up near home if possible, and avoid any extra stops along the way. In addition, stay home if feeling sick, because getting ill in a smaller centre could quickly overwhelm the local health facility.  	   	Another important annual reminder for campers is that since the emerald ash borer has been confirmed in Winnipeg, and Winnipeg remains designated as a federally regulated area, firewood cannot be moved out of Winnipeg. Anyone caught transporting firewood could be fined/charged up to $1,300 for individuals or $15,000 for businesses.  	   	For more information on Manitoba parks, visit https://gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/index.html.

This includes:  	•    safety and health officers under The Workplace Safety and Health Act;  	•    inspectors under The Liquor Gaming and Cannabis Control Act;  	•    public health officers appointed under The Public Health Act;  	•    park patrol officers under The Provincial Parks Act; and  	•    public health officers within Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development including food safety inspectors, animal health inspectors and animal protection officers.   	In addition, with the assistance of Manitoba Conservation officers, who already have the ability to enforce these orders, provincial park patrol officers will be able to enforce public health emergency orders related to public travel, social distancing and gathering size.   	In all, more than 3,000 provincial and municipal personnel can be deployed to enforce COVID-related orders. These officials will operate in their regular roles and provide education and warnings to businesses in their sectors as required. As with other enforcement agencies, tickets will be issued as a last resort.   	Other agencies that are able to enforce these orders include:  	•    RCMP, Winnipeg Police Service, Brandon Police Service and other municipal police agencies;  	•    community safety officers;  	•    First Nations safety officers; and  	•    bylaw enforcement officers.   	Complementing formal enforcement efforts is Operation Safe Apart, which provides an operational framework for the overall enforcement. Operation Safe Apart includes the recruitment of volunteers to assist with public awareness and education with respect to public health orders (PHOs), and refer matters for formal enforcement as necessary. These efforts can be undertaken by a number of organizations including City of Winnipeg community safety ambassadors, Citizens on Patrol (COPP) and the Bear Clan in co-ordination with provincial and municipal officials.   	In the coming days, the Help Next Door MB website and app will be updated to include a section that will assist in matching municipalities with volunteers. Further information will be available at https://helpnextdoormb.ca/.   	In Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made by calling 311, by email at 311@winnipeg.ca or on Twitter @cityofwinnipeg.

This tool is a made-in-Manitoba solution that addresses a need identified by Manitoba businesses as they transition to economic recovery phases of COVID-19.   	“The manufacturing sector, key to Manitoba’s economy, has stepped up in a significant way to make needed protective supplies,” said Ron Koslowsky, divisional vice-president of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters (CME). “As the association representing manufacturers, CME is pleased to support this valuable initiative which will help businesses, their staff and customers operate safely as we help get Manitobans back to work.”   	“The Manitoba Chambers of Commerce is excited about the opportunity this new tool will create for suppliers in Manitoba and, more importantly, for small business owners that are experiencing significant challenges in reopening their businesses in a manner that will be safe for both employees and consumers,” said Chuck Davidson, president and CEO of the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce.   	“Ensuring the well-being of employees and customers is the business community’s top priority,” said Loren Remillard, president and CEO, the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce. “Having the right equipment and procedures in place enables healthy workplaces and the public confidence needed for all phases of Manitoba’s reopening plan. We’re proud to be a partner in this innovative approach to match local need with local supply for the benefit of all Manitobans.”   	In addition, this online marketplace will support those critical businesses that never closed with restocking needed supplies and will help manufacturers who have retooled their current operations to produce PPE and are looking for ways to access a new customer base.   	The online marketplace will be monitored by the Manitoba and Winnipeg Chambers of Commerce and the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters to protect against spam and abuse. They will also ensure that any listings for medical grade PPE are redirected to the provincial government’s PPE portal.   	Developed by Winnipeg-based firm Permission Click, www.B2BManitoba.ca will be secured with the same level of encryption used by leading financial institutions and government agencies so businesses and suppliers can be assured their data is fully protected when using the site.   	“As a key innovation partner for the province of Manitoba, we are proud to deliver another made-in-Manitoba tech solution,” said Joelle Foster, CEO of North Forge Technology Exchange. “This solution is innovative and innovation is what North Forge does best.”   	“In times of need, Manitobans always face the storm together,” said Pallister. “I want to thank our partners, our business community and all Manitobans for everything they are doing and continue to do as we fight COVID-19 and work to restore safe services.

The Premier’s Economic Opportunities Advisory Board will examine the potential creation of new growth hubs and economic clusters, in addition to networks in which businesses and communities would collaborate to support investment, trade and job creation. The plan includes identifying opportunities to transform government policies, programs, regulations, and services to support a fast recovery and renewed economic growth, and a further alignment of post-secondary programs and courses with the province’s labour market needs and priorities.   	“This team of leaders will provide the best possible direction for unleashing private-sector capital and investment for our province,” said Pallister. “The way forward is to foster entrepreneurship and technological growth toward longer-term economic resilience and sustainability.”   	The premier was pleased to announce that Curt Vossen, president and CEO of Richardson International, has agreed to serve as chair of the board.   	“I look forward to the prospect of working together to identify and articulate economic opportunities for Manitoba,” said Vossen.

The registration fee applies to non-commercial vehicles and trucks, resulting in an annual registration fee of $139.

E-licensing allows for access 24 hours a day, seven days a week online and the ability to immediately purchase and print licenses and permits at home.   	The Manitoba government is using the Manitoba Regulatory Consultation Portal for the public consultation. This platform provides the public online access to the proposed regulations, as well as the ability to submit comments and is a part of government’s regulatory accountability initiative.

As we mark National Nursing Week in Canada from May 11 to 17, I want to thank each and every nurse for the hard work, dedication and sacrifices they are making to care for others. Your jobs are not easy. You work long hours, facing great physical and emotional demands, especially during COVID-19. Your skills and expertise improve the quality of life for your patients, and help keep them well. Your leadership is key to the strength of our health-care system.   	A system we have also been working to strengthen following long-overdue changes designed to improve patient care. We have been engaged with health system leadership to stabilize and reinforce the province’s nursing workforce and to implement our campaign pledge to hire a minimum of 200 more nurses.   	It is a commitment we have honoured and our historic investments in health-care are producing results. I am pleased to say there were a total of 409 new nurse hires in all provincial health regions since June 1, 2019.   	In an effort to protect nurses during COVID-19, we have provided health-care staff paid administrative leave to compensate health-care workers who are required to self-isolate due to possible exposure to COVID-19 and to help ease workloads; we made it easier for former registered nurses to apply for an expedited temporary registration during the pandemic.   	This year, May 14 also marks Indigenous Nurses Day in Canada. I want to thank Indigenous nurses across Manitoba for the invaluable care they provide their patients and the leadership they provide to their communities.   	We also remain committed to the midwifery model and expanding the services throughout Manitoba.   	To all nurses and, particularly those new to the profession, know that today and every day we celebrate your achievements and your commitment to caring for others.   	The contributions nurses make to the health, safety and well-being of all Manitobans, as well as their work on the front lines of this pandemic, are greatly appreciated by myself, our government and people across the province.

Petrinex facilitates efficient, standardized, safe and accurate management, and exchange of information essential to the operation of the petroleum sector.   	Benefits anticipated for the oil and gas industry in Manitoba include:  	•    increased standardization of business and operational processes between Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia;  	•    having a single venue for access to timely, accurate and secure data;  	•    tools to assure submissions for government and Industry processes are correct and complete; and  	•    the ability to conduct partner reporting in a standard, effective, electronic venue.   	“The objective of using Petrinex is to ensure timely and accurate reporting of industry’s oil and gas activities, and ultimately an improved system for the payment of taxes and royalties,” said Pedersen. “We have been working closely with the industry over the past year to ensure the system will work for Manitoba.”   	- 30 -  "

In all, the province provides a total of $172.6 million in operating funding to municipalities as well a total of $137 million for municipal infrastructure, and funding for other strategic priorities such as policing, public safety and solid waste reduction.   	“Municipalities are on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting local communities and delivering essential services,” said Ralph Groening, president of the Association of Manitoba Municipalities. “Providing a larger portion of operating funding up front will certainly help alleviate the tremendous financial pressures on our members. We commend the Province of Manitoba for providing this timely assistance.”   	Full details Restoring Safe Services: Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap to Recoveryare available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/restoring/ and businesses with questions on restoring their services should visit https://engagemb.ca.   	Maintaining critical funding to municipalities is one of the ways the provincial government continues to support directly Manitoba communities. In March, the province announced nearly $8 million in one-time funding for spring flood preparedness projects in 83 municipalities.   	Manitoba has invested more than $900 million under the Manitoba Protection Plan in the fight against COVID-19. In addition, the province has announced a number of measures in order to provide financial relief for Manitobans including:  	•    Ensuring up to $110 million is returned to Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) policyholders. Rebates are expected to be around 11 per cent, or between $140 to $160 per average policyholder.  	•    Providing up to $120 million to support Manitoba’s small and medium-sized businesses through the Manitoba Gap Protection Program (MGPP). The province will advance each eligible business the non-interest bearing forgivable MGPP loan of $6,000, for a total of up to $120 million.  	•    Returning the $37-million Workers Compensation Board (WCB) surplus to eligible Manitoba employers. This month, eligible employers will receive a credit to their account based on  	20 per cent of their 2019 premium. WCB expects $29 million will be returned to the private sector, with approximately $7 million going to small businesses in Manitoba.

Effective May 11, Manitobans who have prescriptions for long-term medications will be able to fill them as per their prescriber’s directions up to a three-month supply, if the drug is not affected by shortages.   	In March, the government moved to restrict prescription fills to one month in response to global drug shortages. This move was consistent with all provinces and territories, and was in response to advice received from the Canadian Pharmacists Association and Canadian Association for Pharmaceutical Distributors and Management.   	In Manitoba, these limits were imposed on March 19. This was done to minimize potential distribution shortages and prevent people from stockpiling medication due in part to messaging from the federal government to Canadians. Another contributing factor is the typically high volume of dispensing that occurs at the end of Manitoba’s Pharmacare Program year, which is in late March.   	“While this decision to restrict prescription fills to one month was necessary, we have been monitoring carefully the consequences and recognize the impact this has had on many Manitobans,” said Friesen. “As a result, our government is pleased to be removing the one-month limit now that the global and domestic drug supply is showing to be more stable.”   	Friesen noted today’s announcement builds on other measures the government has taken to minimize the financial pressure caused as a result of the policy.   	“Our government acted early and announced shortly after placing the limit on prescription fills, pharmacare rates would be frozen at last year’s level, and users would see no increase to their pharmacare deductible,” said Friesen.   	The minister also announced the immediate establishment of a time-limited, COVID-19 drug shortage working group which will be comprised of provincial officials, as well as representatives from Pharmacists Manitoba and the College of Pharmacists of Manitoba.   	This working group will be responsible for ongoing surveillance and monitoring of drug availability in the province. This work will allow the group to make evidence-based decisions as to what drugs should continue to only be dispensed in one-month allotments. The work of the group will be guided by Health Canada’s list of drugs in short supply that can be found at www.drugshortagescanada.ca. The working group will also solicit for proposals from industry, stakeholder groups and health-related associations to make evidence-based decisions in a collaborative format.   	To ensure Manitobans can benefit from this financial relief, while also allowing the working group to begin their work, only drugs currently listed in short supply on the federal government’s drug shortages website will be subject to the one-month fill limit. Pharmacists will be able to advise their clients about which specific drugs are in short supply and might be subject to dispensing limits.   	Further to the announcement, the minister noted Manitobans who have experienced a significant change in their income can have their Manitoba Pharmacare Program deductible reviewed. Individuals can estimate their income for the current year, which in turn will set a new deductible for that same year. Following the filing of the individual’s income taxes for the current year, the projected income is then compared to the actual income and the difference is reconciled. To have a Manitoba pharmacare deductible reviewed, call 204-786-7141 or (toll-free) at 1-800-297-8099, or by emailing pharmacare@gov.mb.ca.   	Pharmacists Manitoba is asking their clients to appropriately refill their medications, such as not refilling more than 10 days before their next scheduled refill, and not requesting quantities in excess of 100 days’ supply, to help maintain the drug supply going forward.   	To help ease the financial burden on seniors, the Manitoba government also announced May 5, the Seniors Economic Recovery Credit which will provide every Manitoban aged 65 and older with a one-time, refundable tax credit of $200.

The masks are designed to meet the needs of front-line health-care workers who need reliable and comfortable protection. They can also be sterilized after use, allowing them to be reused up to 30 times. Petropolis and Robertson have made their design open source so that others can more quickly access and manufacture this innovative, reusable mask.   	After receiving proposals from across the country, Winnipeg-based Precision ADM was selected to finalize the design and produce it in Manitoba at a cost competitive with similar masks produced overseas.   	“As a physician, not only do I recognize the critical role our front-line workers have in meeting the health-care needs of Manitobans, they are also my friends, family and colleagues,” said Petropolis, a Winnipeg-based physician and surgeon who developed the design for this reusable mask. “In this time of need, I was happy that I could be of assistance in providing an option with this silicone mask. I have been incredibly impressed with the response of the province as this initiative would not have moved forward without the foresight in funding a locally developed and produced mask.”   	“We owe it to the front-line care providers to keep them safe and maintain their confidence in their protective equipment,” added Robertson, medical director of intermediate intensive care at Health Sciences Centre, who led the testing of this new mask design. “This massive co-operative effort between the government of Manitoba, medicine and industry is ensuring we can meet that obligation.”   	The Manitoba government has placed an initial order with Precision ADM for 500,000 of the masks, with an option to purchase an additional 500,000 masks over the next 14 months.   	“In these unprecedented times, we are all doing our best to stay safe and help our community in any way we can and, as proud Manitobans, Precision ADM is honoured to have the opportunity to manufacture these essential reusable N95 masks for our front line workers,” said Martin Petrak, co-founder and CEO of Precision ADM. “Working with our Manitoba-based partners BOMImed, Melet Plastics Inc., and the Orthopaedic Innovation Centre, we will create a reliable new Canadian secure supply chain to fight COVID-19.”   	“This is an extraordinary success story for our province,” Helwer said. “By working together and harnessing the ingenuity of Manitobans, we’re helping keep Manitobans safe and healthy in the face of this global pandemic.”   	The Manitoba government continues to call on manufacturers, businesses and other organizations to assist in procurement efforts.   	The province is asking manufacturers or businesses to visit the COVID-19 portal at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/index.html if:  	•    they can rapidly scale up production or retool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19; or  	•    they have a stock of personal protective equipment that is not being used due to closures and physical distancing.   	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition.

The fund is managed by The Winnipeg Foundation.   	The grant is intended to assist primarily with conservation work on existing military memorials in Manitoba, with the goal of extending the physical life and commemorative function of the memorials.   	The minister noted priority this year was given to projects related to the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.   	“As time marches on, it’s still so important to remember and honour the sacrifices made for us in the Second World War,” Cox said. “That’s why the Manitoba government is committed to preserving these important memorials, which provide opportunities to reflect and give thanks.”   	Private donations from organizations, communities and veterans’ groups help to ensure Manitoba’s military memorials are properly preserved for future generations. The fund is expected to generate $100,000 annually, the minister noted.   	It is estimated there are more than 200 military memorials of varying types across the province, ranging from 20 to 100 years old, and many of the memorials require repair and maintenance.

The province will match all funds raised by universities and colleges for the MSBI for the year, dollar for dollar, instead of with one dollar for every two dollars raised or donated privately.   	“As students and the post-secondary institutions they attend deal with challenges created by COVID-19, the Manitoba government is committed to providing the funding they need during these uncertain times,” said Pallister. “We are facing the obstacles in front of us together, and it is imperative that we rely on our strong partnership with post-secondary institutions and our shared vision for access to education.”   	By temporarily matching contributions from universities and colleges under the MSBI for 2020-21 with a 1:1 instead of a 1:2 ratio, the province will better ensure students receive financial supports amid fundraising challenges faced by post-secondary institutions due to the pandemic.   	As well, the province is committing $5 million to the MSBI program on top of the $10 million announced in Budget 2020, to maximize funds for students during the pandemic. With the 1:1 matching dollars, approximately $30 million will be provided to students this year through scholarships and bursaries.   	The MSBI is delivered by 12 participating post-secondary institutions and the Business Council of Manitoba, which undertake their own fundraising matched by provincial contributions. The MSBI has been highly successful, with a combined disbursement of approximately $23 million in private and public funds to 13,000 students in 2017-18, and with about $24 million to 14,700 students in 2018-19.   	The number of students who benefited from the MSBI in 2019-20 will be known this fall, and it is expected that the number will have increased, the premier noted.   	In addition, the separate Manitoba Bursary program, which provides up-front financial support to students in need, has been increased by $1.8 million for 2020-21 to put a total of $17.3 million into the hands of students when they need it as they begin their studies.   	The province has made significant enhancements to the Manitoba Bursary program since 2016-17. These changes have more than quadrupled the number of students in financial need who benefit. It is estimated that nearly 11,500 students will be supported under the Manitoba Bursary in 2019-20, the premier added.   	These measures further build on recently announced provincial supports for students including the $120-million Summer Student Recovery Plan – a $7-per-hour wage subsidy for employers to hire them – and a deferral of repayments of student loans to help those affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19. To date, more than 675 summer jobs for students have been supported through the new wage subsidy program.   	“Students are the future of our province and these improvements to the funding of bursaries will play a crucial role in Manitoba’s recovery from the pandemic,” said Pallister. “Students will have greater opportunities to help stimulate Manitoba’s economy and move the province forward.”  A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at: https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.   	- 30 -  "

Anglers are asked to protect fish stocks by releasing fish who are discharging eggs back into the water. Manitobans are also reminded to exercise caution around flowing water and deteriorating ice conditions while enjoying Manitoba’s fishing opportunities.   	Manitobans are reminded that when outside, it is still important to practise social distancing according to current COVID-19 public health guidelines. For more information, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.   	The Manitoba government announced on April 9 the launch of its new, online service for the sale of outdoor licences and permits including angling licences. All anglers are required to obtain an angling licence to fish in Manitoba, unless exempt. Angling licences are now available online 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can be immediately purchased and printed at home. For more information and to purchase an angling licence, visit www.manitobaelicensing.ca.   	Anglers also need to be familiar with Manitoba's fishing regulations. On April 1, a new regulation came into force that states all walleye and sauger under 35 centimetres in length must be released from the Red River, Winnipeg River below the Pine Falls Dam, and Lake Winnipeg and its tributaries up to the first impassable barrier. This regulation will help support walleye and sauger populations in these fisheries. For more information on all provincial fishing regulations, refer to the 2020 Manitoba Anglers’ Guide at www.manitobafisheries.com.   	To prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) such as zebra mussels, surface water-users are reminded of the requirements when entering and exiting all water bodies in Manitoba. Additional decontamination and bait requirements are needed within AIS control zones. AIS requirements and set fines for offences are in effect year round. The AIS open-water season checklist is a step-by-step resource that can help surface water-users comply with the Manitoba government’s AIS regulations.   	The province will again be operating watercraft inspection stations to help watercraft users be compliant with AIS requirements. Anyone transporting a powerboat, canoe, Jet Ski or other type of watercraft over land, must stop at the inspection stations when they are open. The set fine for failing to stop at a watercraft inspection station is $672.   	After three years of monitoring Singush Lake, no evidence of the presence of zebra mussels has been found. As a result, the lake, located in Duck Mountain Provincial Park, will reopen for day-use boaters in 2020.

Seniors who have changed mailing addresses since the time of their 2018 tax filings will have an opportunity to update the Department of Finance on their address changes through a government web portal at www.manitoba.ca/seniorseconomicrecoverycredit. Those who do not receive a cheque, have not updated their addresses or are new residents of Manitoba will be able to receive the $200 credit when they file their 2020 income tax return.   	Almost every senior across the province will receive the payment in May. The $200 credit will not be counted taxable as income and will not be used to claw back income-tested benefits to seniors, the premier noted.   	“As we slowly and carefully begin the process of reopening of our province’s economy, this credit is putting $45 million directly into the hands of Manitobans as we move forward from COVID-19,” said Pallister. “Manitoba seniors deserve assistance during this pandemic.

However, through these efforts by non-front-line care government departments and other public-sector organizations, 4.9 per cent of non-essential operating expenses and 2.2 per cent of non-essential workforce expenditures will be redirected to the front-line COVID response.    	“Our aim has always been to minimize temporary public-sector layoffs, despite the tremendous fiscal challenges we’re facing,” said Fielding. “And through our success in finding other necessary operating savings in non-essential discretionary spending areas, we will have kept our actual workforce expense reductions to just over two per cent, many of which have already been implemented.”   	The province is now projecting a deficit up to $5 billion in 2020-21, caused by a drop in provincial revenues of approximately $3 billion and additional COVID-19 related costs of approximately$2 billion. The cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) alone could reach up to $1 billion, the minister highlighted, and the province has committed more than $250 million to support struggling businesses with more support programs to be announced in the coming weeks.   	External rating agencies continue to report that Manitoba has the highest direct-debt-to-revenue ratio among provinces, estimated at 297 per cent, and the highest direct debt per capita. These same agencies have reported that, due to this high debt load, Manitoba is among the most vulnerable of all provinces to withstand economic shocks such as the global COVID-19 pandemic.   	“We will continue to responsibly address our profound challenges. In order to procure PPE and support the rapidly escalating costs of our ongoing front-line response to the pandemic and mounting pressures on other areas of government, we have to focus our spending and spend smarter,” said Fielding. “We’ve taken an all-hands-on-deck approach, working together with management, public-sector unions and our front-line workers within government departments and our outside reporting entities, to find creative ways to redirect resources to where they’re needed most and innovative ways to adjust our service delivery models given the new realities caused by COVID-19.”   	The minister cited numerous examples of successful teamwork and innovation since March:  	•    the repurposing of Crown corporation facilities for front-line support,  	•    the redeployment of hundreds of staff across government and Crown corporations to priority areas such as the Manitoba Emergency Co-ordination Centre and centralized pandemic procurement and distribution logistics within the health system,  	•    the redeployment of Shared Health employees to Cadham Labs to support increased testing capacity, and  	•    the creation of inter-disciplinary teams to address the urgent priority of supporting front-line health-care workers with child-care opportunities and rapidly rolling out new support programs for Manitobans.   	The minister also reinforced the work of government and outside reporting entities to minimize layoffs continues and that government would pursue all alternative tools, such as voluntary reduced workweeks and possible work sharing options, to achieve the necessary reduction in workforce expenses.

People can protect themselves by performing regular tick checks after spending time outdoors, knowing where blacklegged ticks may be found, minimizing their risk of exposure and recognizing the signs and symptoms of tick-borne diseases. These precautions will help protect against anaplasmosis, babesiosis and Lyme disease.   	Manitobans are reminded that when outside, it is still important to practice social distancing according to current COVID-19 public health guidelines. For more information, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.   	Blacklegged ticks, which can carry anaplasmosis, babesiosis and Lyme disease, are most commonly found within and along the edge of forests and in areas with thick, woody shrubs and other vegetation. These ticks are typically found from early spring when snow melts through late fall.    	The province continues to monitor and assess the continued expansion of blacklegged tick populations. Members of the public can assist with surveillance by submitting images of collected ticks to the ticks@gov.mb.ca email. Maps of areas with known blacklegged tick populations, where the risk of tick-borne disease transmission is greatest, can be found at: www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/tickborne/surveillance.html.   	The burden of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in Manitoba continues to increase, and the 2019 season was the most active to date with 64 confirmed and probable Lyme disease cases reported. Since 2015, nearly 90 per cent of anaplasmosis and Lyme disease cases reported in Manitoba had likely local exposure. Most anaplasmosis and Lyme disease cases were exposed between May and July, and less than 40 per cent recalled a tick bite. This low recall likely reflects exposure to smaller blacklegged tick nymphs, whose activity also peaks between May and July.   	Limiting exposure to potentially infected blacklegged ticks, particularly the smaller nymphs who are active during the late spring and summer months, is the key to tick-borne disease prevention. Manitobans are encouraged to take precautions to minimize their risk of tick exposure by:  	•    applying an appropriate tick repellent, following label directions, on exposed skin and clothing;  	•    inspecting themselves, children and pets after spending time outdoors;  	•    removing ticks as soon as possible from people and pets;   	•    staying to the centre of walking trails;  	•    wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts; and  	•    keeping grass and shrubs around homes cut short to create drier environments that are less suitable for blacklegged tick survival.   	To learn more about blacklegged ticks, tick-disease, symptoms and prevention visit: www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/tickborne/index.html.

Following Wednesday’s release of Restoring Safe Services: Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap to Recovery, the premier hosted a series of socially distanced meetings and tele-conferences to discuss the front-line fight against the pandemic with municipal leaders from across Manitoba.     	“Manitobans are resilient and it is heartwarming to witness the way our communities band together in times of crisis,” said Pallister. “We will beat this pandemic together and will come out stronger for it.”   	Full details on the plan are available at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices and businesses with questions on restoring their services should visit https://engagemb.ca/.   	Maintaining critical funding to municipalities is one of the ways the provincial government continues to directly support Manitoba communities. In March, the province announced nearly $8 million in one-time funding for spring flood preparedness projects in 83 municipalities.   	Manitoba has invested more than $900 million under the Manitoba Protection Plan in the fight against COVID-19. In addition, the province has announced a number of measures in order to provide financial relief for Manitobans including:  	•    Ensuring up to $110 million is returned to Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) policyholders. Rebates are expected to be around 11 per cent, or between $140 to $160 per average policyholder.  	•    Providing up to $120 million to support Manitoba’s small and medium-sized businesses through the Manitoba Gap Protection Program (MGPP). The province will advance each eligible business the non-interest bearing forgivable MGPP loan of $6,000, for a total of up to $120 million.  	•    Returning the $37-million Workers Compensation Board (WCB) surplus to eligible Manitoba employers. This month, eligible employers will receive a credit to their account based on 20 per cent of their 2019 premium. WCB expects $29 million will be returned to the private sector, with approximately $7 million going to small businesses in Manitoba.

These sittings will proceed on a schedule as they would normally, with a question period at 1:30 p.m. and debate on government business in the afternoon.   	A reduced number of members will be in the chamber to participate at any given time, in accordance with public health requirements as ordered by Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.

I encourage the public to take part in this consultation.”   	The amendments to the regulation would transition paramedics and emergency medical responders to work under regulations outlined by the College of Paramedics of Manitoba, and would set out the categories of procedures that members of the profession are authorized to perform.   	Currently, paramedicine is not a self-regulating profession like other health professions. Instead, paramedics and emergency medical responders are licensed by Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) under The Emergency Medical Response and Stretcher Transportation Act. The Practice of Paramedicine Regulation was enacted on June 1, 2018, to:    	•    designate the profession of paramedicine as a regulated health profession,  	•    establish the College of Paramedics of Manitoba, and  	•    set out the scope of practice of the profession.   	In addition, the Council of the College of Paramedics is seeking public feedback on a proposed College of Paramedics of Manitoba General Regulation.   	“We are appreciative of the opportunity for the public consultation to commence. We value the opinion of the public, paramedics, and other stakeholders related to the proposed regulation,” said Trish Bergal, executive director/registrar, College of Paramedics of Manitoba. “This is an important step to becoming a self-regulated profession in Manitoba.”   	This regulation defines who is able to register with the college and practice as a paramedic or an emergency medical responder, defines what type of health-care procedures paramedics can perform and the terms and conditions on the performance of those procedures, and sets out standards of practice for the profession and continuing competency requirements.   	Due to COVID-19 and restrictions under current public health orders, the public is encouraged to review the proposed amendments and provide feedback online until June 29.

Public health orders restricting staff from working in more than one licensed personal care home (PCH) have been signed and will take effect today. The single-site restriction is intended to provide additional protection against the introduction and/or spread of the COVID-19 virus within PCHs.   	In recognition of the vulnerability of the PCH population to severe illness and/or death related to the virus, provincial planning has been underway to ensure the change is able to be implemented quickly while ensuring stable staffing and service continuity. As of today, all of Manitoba’s 127 licensed PCHs have confirmed readiness, with staff in place.   	It is important to note that while some gradual lifting of restrictions has begun, significant work to limit the spread of COVID-19 must continue. Public health officials are also advising people to remain within or close to their home communities. The request to stay home as much as possible is still in place at this time. This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba and neighbouring jurisdictions, to essential trips only.   	The province is also launching an education campaign on being ‘COVID careful’ in cottage country to remind all campers and cottagers that COVID-19 guidelines must be followed. The goal is to raise awareness and encourage Manitobans to do the same within their social networks by posting supportive educational messages.   	The campaign will include portable signs and education stops on key highway routes, new materials that can be displayed in car and cottage windows, as well as a social media campaign, all designed to show that cottagers in provincial parks and across the province are aware of their responsibilities and are encouraging others to stay mindful.   	A secure online portal is being established to allow Manitobans who have been tested for COVID-19 to more quickly access their negative test results. Starting next week, when people are tested they will receive information about how to register and access these results. Users will need a Manitoba health registration card in order to access their results online.   	A toll-free number will be available early next week to provide results to those without a Manitoba health card or those without internet access. As always, public health officials will directly notify Manitobans who have tested positive for COVID-19.   	A new drive-thru community testing site opened today in Swan River, at the Manitoba Public Insurance facility, 125 Fourth Ave. North. Hours of operation are daily from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. This is Manitoba’s 16th community testing site and ninth drive-thru location.   	Additionally, work is underway to get a new testing site established at Thunderbird House to support access to testing for Winnipeg’s homeless and shelter populations, as well as a new mobile service available in the next two weeks to serve clients with limited mobility.

The MGPP provides an interest-free, forgivable $6,000 loan to small and medium-sized businesses in Manitoba that have experienced hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health orders. Loans are available to businesses that fail to qualify for the various federal government assistance programs and wage subsidies created because of COVID-19.   	Eligible businesses will receive a one-time, lump-sum payment of $6,000, electronically deposited into their business bank account.   	“Our government has been working with Manitoba’s business sector to identify the greatest need and target our support to businesses harmed by the pandemic and its fallout,” said Pallister. “We are working with our partners to ensure we make the right decisions at the right time so we can provide maximum opportunities for recovery for the benefit of all Manitobans.”   	Permanent, Manitoba-based businesses that were operational in the province on March 20 (the date the Manitoba government declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19) are eligible to apply if they temporarily ceased or curtailed operations as a result of a COVID-19 public health order, which harmed their business in Manitoba. Businesses must not have received federal government COVID-19 grant funding support, and do not intend to apply for and receive previously announced federal government COVID-19 non-repayable funding support.   	Eligible businesses are now able to submit online applications forms at https://manitoba.ca/covid19/business/mgpp.html.

Human-caused wildfires, primarily grass fires, have been reported in the south. In order to reduce the risk of fire and the risk of exposure to COVID-19 for front-line firefighters, the province is asking the public to be particularly cautious when outdoors to prevent human-caused wildfires. Protecting front-line firefighters and support staff during the COVID-19 pandemic is a top priority to ensure they remain healthy and available to respond to wildfires during the upcoming season.   	In light of current events and as a wildfire prevention measure, provincial burn permits issued under The Wildfires Act within the burning permit area will be limited to only essential crop residue burning and other required agricultural, municipal or industrial operations. Burning within the burning permit area requires the approval of an officer and may include a site inspection. Contact a Manitoba Conservation and Climate office for more information. The latest information on municipal and provincial burn restrictions can be found at www.manitoba.ca/wildfire.   	All applicable provincial and municipal burning approval processes must be followed before burning. Provincial burn permit holders must comply with Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development’s guidance on crop residue burning and their municipality’s burning permit conditions, where applicable. Daily guidance for crop residue burning will be posted by 11 a.m. at www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/crop-residue-burning-program/index.html.   	Where there is a conflict, consult with a local Manitoba Conservation and Climate office or municipal authority for clarification. Provincial burn permits will not be issued for areas where municipalities have already implemented burning restrictions.    	Burn permit holders are reminded to check weather conditions, have adequate suppression equipment and ensure proper fuel breaks are in place before burning. Never leave an outdoor fire unattended and always extinguish it before leaving.    	Anyone using an ATV should stay on developed trails, stop frequently to check areas around the engine and exhaust for debris, and carefully dispose of any debris caught in equipment. A small shovel, axe, and fire extinguisher should be carried on ATVs at all times.    	To report a wildfire, call 911 or the T.I.P. line (toll-free) at 1-800-782-0076.   	- 30 -  	   "

The data also shows:  	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized, with no individuals in intensive care;  	•    49 active cases and 220 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and  	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.   	As of yesterday, an additional 424 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 24,723.   	Public Health orders restricting staff from working in more than one licensed personal care home (PCH) have been signed and will take effect May 1. The single-site restriction is intended to provide additional protection against the introduction and/or spread of the COVID-19 virus within PCHs.   	In recognition of the vulnerability of the PCH population to severe illness and/or death related to the virus, provincial planning has been underway to ensure the change is able to be implemented quickly while ensuring stable staffing and service continuity. Of the 127 licensed PCHs in Manitoba, 121 have confirmed readiness, with work ongoing to address staffing issues at the remaining sites by the weekend.   	It is important to note that while some gradual lifting or restrictions has begun, significant work to limit the spread of COVID-19 must continue. Public health is also advising people to remain within or close to their home communities. The request to stay home as much as possible is still in place at this time. This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only. Visits to cottages are not recommended at this time. Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.   	A new drive-thru community testing site will open Friday in Swan River, at the Manitoba Public Insurance facility, 125 Fourth Ave. North. Hours of operation will be daily from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. This is Manitoba’s 16th community testing site and ninth drive-thru location.

Together, we are supporting vulnerable youth so they can continue to feel connected to family members, elders and siblings during this difficult time.”   	TELUS has donated more than 120 tablets with data plans to the province. The majority will go to emergency placement shelters operated by Winnipeg Child and Family Services (CFS), which are used until arrangements that are more permanent can be made for children coming into care and to provide a safe place for youth who may be in safe havens or group care settings. Some of the tablets will go to small operators who provide services to at-risk youth. The tablets will help children to quickly reconnect with family members, friends, teachers and other supports, creating stability during this challenging time, the minister noted.   	“TELUS is deeply committed to keeping Manitobans safe and connected during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the province’s most at-risk and vulnerable citizens,” said Tim Prokipchuk, director of sales, TELUS. “This public health crisis has reminded us all of the importance of human connection, and it is a privilege for our team to be able to provide access to the devices and service needed for children to stay in touch with loved ones, educators and vital support services.”   	Eighty-five tablets will be used by Winnipeg CFS. The remaining tablets will be distributed to community partners that also provide emergency as well as longer-term placements and supports for vulnerable children from across the province including:  	•    Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre (11 tablets);  	•    Neecheewam (seven);  	•    Ndinawemaaganag Endaawaad (six);  	•    Blue Thunderbird Family Care (five);  	•    Roots Youth Care (four);  	•    Reach Youth Services (three); and  	•    Jessie Home (two).   	“These are indeed trying times, especially for children and youth in care,” said Karl Gompf, acting executive director, Jessie Home. “The TELUS donation is coming at a crucial time and is like a breath of fresh air. Keeping in touch with family and friends and enhanced contact with teachers is so essential for the positive mental health of our young people. From the staff and residents, virtual hugs.”   	The minister noted this partnership builds on the Manitoba Protection Plan, a series of government-wide initiatives to support Manitobans through the COVID-19 pandemic.     	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at: https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.   	- 30 -  BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

The data also shows:  	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized, with no individuals in intensive care;  	•    54 active cases and 213 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and  	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.   	As of yesterday, an additional 448 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 24,304.   	Today, health officials released information about the models developed in Manitoba to inform the management plan for the COVID-19 pandemic in Manitoba. A model for the spread of COVID-19 was created, using data and information available in the scientific literature from other jurisdictions and with input from experts in Manitoba.    	   	Officials noted that modelling results are always an abstraction and cannot project all possible outcomes. Outbreaks also evolve and change over time as public health measures are put in place and people’s behaviour changes. Therefore, these projections must be constantly revised. As new information is received, officials will continue to refine the projections, models and health advice for Manitobans.  	   	Current models show that:  	•    under routine public health measures, which include case interviews and contact tracing but which do not include social and physical distancing or travel restrictions, modeling suggests Manitoba would have had 933 cases by April 25. If that trend had continued, there would have been more than 2,000 cases by mid-May. However, the number of cases on April 25 was 267.  	•    under current public health measures, Manitoba could expect approximately 6,250 cases if the current measures remain in place for a year.  	•    the Manitoba health-care system has 2,432 acute care medical and surgical hospital beds. As of April 26, 977 of these beds were currently vacant and available for COVID-19 patients, a 40 per cent vacancy rate. This shows Manitoba is well within hospital capacity at this time.  	•    the Manitoba health-care system has 86 adult intensive care hospital beds. As of April 22, 29 of these beds were vacant and available for COVID-19 patients, a 34 per cent vacancy rate. This shows Manitoba is well within intensive care capacity at this time.  	   	This data supports the easing of public health measures, as announced earlier today. Officials also noted that planning is underway to add an additional 300 beds and an additional 100 intensive care beds for COVID-19 patients, if needed. Additional capacity options are being investigated if they are necessary.

All businesses and venues will be required to continue following social distancing and stringent cleaning practices to protect both employees and customers.   	Size restrictions of public and private gatherings of no more than 10 people will remain in place. Everyone is expected to continue to follow social distancing rules at all times and to stay home if they are sick. Travel restrictions will remain in place such as avoiding all non-essential travel outside of Manitoba, and requirements for self-isolation for 14 days following travel will continue.   	Based on the evolving global public health recommendations and modelling, Manitoba is in a position to begin a methodical, phased-in approach to reopening businesses, said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.   	“Our public health measures to date have helped us reduce case numbers and flatten the curve, but it is not practical to maintain these measures indefinitely,” said Roussin. “That is why we will gradually reduce these measures including balancing the need to protect vulnerable Manitobans from COVID-19 with the need to protect Manitobans from the unintended impacts of strict public health measures, which include health and social impacts.”  Phased Approach to Restoring Services  Restoring Safe Services:  Manitoba’s Pandemic Economic Recovery Roadmap consists of multiple phases. It is critical to note the timing and specifics noted in each phase are subject to change, based on the advice of public health experts and a continuous assessment of transmission patterns and other factors.   	Full details are available at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices.  Restoring Services (Phase One) – Beginning May 4   	Critical public health measures and travel restrictions remain. Priority elective surgeries have been restarted, diagnostics screening will resume and some non-essential businesses will reopen but must limit occupancy to 50 per cent of normal business levels or one person per 10 square metres, whichever is lower. Services, businesses and venues include:  	•    non-urgent surgery and diagnostic procedures;  	•    therapeutic and medical services;  	•    retail businesses;  	•    restaurants – patio/walk-up services;  	•    hair salons;  	•    museums, galleries and libraries;  	•    seasonal day camps; and  	•    outdoor recreation and campgrounds.   	The province will continually re-evaluate and adjust plans for further easing of secondary public health measures and may reintroduce others.  Restoring Services (Phase Two) – No Earlier Than June 1   	Critical public health measures and travel restrictions may remain in place. Public gathering sizes may be increased and more non-essential businesses will be considered for reopening including:  	•    additional personal services, such as nail salons;  	•    restaurants – dine-in services;  	•    non-contact children’s sports; and  	•    film production.  Future Phases   	Public health measures may be eased further. Additional guidelines will be developed, public gathering sizes will be increased and some non-essential business will fully open. Others may begin to reopen, such as bars, pools and spas, movie theatres and indoor recreational facilities. Travel restrictions may be eased.   	Specific considerations for other businesses and sectors may be made including:  	•    performing arts venues;  	•    other non-essential businesses;  	•    tattoo parlours, estheticians, cosmetologists and tanning studios; and  	•    large gatherings/events.   	Mass gatherings such as concerts, summer festivals and major sporting events will not be considered before September 2020, Roussin noted.   	Child care plays an important role in restoring services, enabling parents to return to the workplace, and remains a priority. The Department of Families will continue to work with the child-care community to expand the temporary child-care services available, including a grant available to child-care providers seeking to open a new, home-based child-care service.

We are suspending certain statutory requirements and extending deadlines with the well-being of Manitobans in mind.”   	The province is implementing four orders, retroactive to the beginning of the state of emergency March 20:  	•    Youth in Care Provisions Order,  	•    Student Aid Provisions Order,  	•    International Fuel Tax Agreement Credential Provisions Order, and  	•    Trucking and Transportation Provisions Order.   	“We’re making responsible, common sense adjustments because it’s the right thing to do in this time of crisis,” said Pallister. “Youth in the care of Manitoba Child and Family Services (CFS) will continue to be supported, even if they age out of the system during this state of emergency. Post-secondary students and graduates won’t have to stress about losing eligibility for student aid or repaying loans during this time.   	“We’re also taking steps to extend permits and to safely reduce some regulatory requirements for truck drivers and commercial vehicle operators to ensure they can stay on the road and continue the movement of essential goods and supplies.”   	Under the Youth in Care Provisions Order, youth in the CFS system who turn 18 during this period must continue to be offered ongoing supports. This extension also applies to young adults who have chosen to sign a voluntary agreement to continue to receive assistance as they transition to independence, which would allow them to remain eligible beyond age 21.      	The Student Aid Provisions Order allows post-secondary students to remain eligible for aid, even if they temporarily stop qualifying during the state of emergency period. The provision lowers the minimum monthly repayment to $0 from $25, suspends the obligation for a student to start paying back their loan eight months after they end their studies, prevents borrowers from going into default during the state of emergency period and extends the maximum term for repayment. Those with existing loans are not obligated to pay back their loan for six months beginning March 30.   	The International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) Credential Provisions Order suspends the requirement that a carrier licensed under the agreement must have and display credentials, and the province will not fine licensed carriers if their licensing authority was unable to distribute their credentials.   	The province previously provided relief to carriers who do not have an IFTA licence in The Fuel Tax Amendment and Retail Sales Tax Amendment Act. The requirement to obtain a single-trip permit for each truck entering Manitoba was suspended for the duration of the state of emergency.   	The Trucking and Transportation Provisions Order is extending the expiry dates on certain permits, certificates or registrations until July 31. This includes qualifying vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan (IRP), the vehicle registration system for trucks and buses operating inter-jurisdictionally between Manitoba and other provinces or states throughout North America. Deadlines to pay IRP registration renewal charges are also extended. The order also extends the period between required inspections on vehicles such as buses and commercial carriers, extends annual overweight or over-dimensional vehicle permits, and extends safety fitness certificates for commercial carriers. The order will also provide a temporary exemption from the need for single-trip permits for increased vehicle weights and for commercial vehicles from other jurisdictions.   	The regular three-month deadline for new residents and non-residents to replace their out-of-province driving permits with a Manitoba driver’s licence, vehicle registration or insurance is also extended to July 31 (or three months after they enter the province, whichever time period is longer).   	The province has the ability to revoke any of the above orders sooner than stated above if it deems necessary.

With increased levels of tracking, testing and isolation, we will have a better understanding of how we are doing as a province in flattening the COVID curve. This is crucial as we carefully and slowly work toward expanding services safely in the coming weeks and months.”   	Effective immediately, the province is expanding testing criteria to any Manitoban with symptoms of COVID-19, even mild symptoms including a cough, runny nose, sore throat and/or fever, to be tested to better determine the spread of the virus in Manitoba, the premier noted.   	In order to facilitate enhanced testing provincewide, Dynacare will begin significantly increasing COVID-19 testing alongside Manitoba’s primary public health lab, Cadham Provincial Lab (CPL).   	Dynacare has been performing COVID-19 tests since early April out of its Ontario-based laboratory to supplement the capacity of CPL and, as of April 27, has completed 557 tests. The Manitoba government and Dynacare have entered into a partnership that will see up to 2,000 tests a day before the end of summer.   	With CPL’s capacity at over 1,000 tests daily, the province expects to have testing capacity of well over 3,000 tests a day, tripling the provinces current testing capacity, the premier noted. In addition, Dynacare will work toward establishing a second COVID testing lab in Winnipeg, assisting the province with faster processing times.   	Shared Health’s diagnostic services is also supporting the province’s enhanced testing capacity, performing some COVID-19 testing for patients at HSC Winnipeg prior to surgery and producing quantities of the viral medium needed to transport testing swabs to laboratories.    	In addition to testing, Dynacare call centre staff have been communicating negative test results to Manitobans and delivering COVID-19 test specimens from screening and assessment centres to CPL. They have also established specimen collection centres for patients with compromised immune systems.  	   	Manitobans are reminded that if they are showing symptoms of COVID-19 and meet testing criteria, they can call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 for more information.  	   	For up-to-date information on testing criteria and community screening sites, visit www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

Today, we pause to remember and honour those who died of work-related causes and those whose lives have been forever impacted by injury and illness.   	In 2019, 19 Manitobans died as a result of occupational illness and acute hazards. They are mourned by their families, friends and coworkers.   	As we remember them, we are renewing our commitment to keep Manitoban safe and healthy in the workplace.   	We will continue to work together with employers and other partners toward our common goal of bringing Manitobans home safe from work each and every day.   	While we cannot remember these workers in person today due to COVID-19 restrictions, virtual events are being held in Winnipeg to commemorate and honour them. The flags at the main entrance of the Legislative Building have been lowered today to mark this important day of reflection and action.

The changes will allow individuals to select a non-binary option, in addition to male or female, when applying for a change of sex designation under The Vital Statistics Act.   	The Vital Statistics Agency has updated its policy and forms to comply with this change.     	In a November 2019 decision, the Manitoba Human Rights Commission (MHRC) required the province to recognize and implement policies to allow for non-binary sex designations by May 2, 2020. The policy change ensures Manitoba complies with the MHRC ruling.   	The Manitoba government has taken the additional step of introducing a legislative change that would remove the requirement to display sex designation on birth and death certificates.

Our government, along with of our provincial counterparts, is working step by step to support our producers as they provide an essential service to all Canadians,” said Bibeau. “By creating a centralized online platform for Manitoban producers to sell their products, we are increasing flexibility in the supply chain during a very challenging time.”   	“Increasing access to Manitoba’s diverse selection of foods grown or processed in the province will build resiliency in our food system and proactively address concerns about food insecurity,” said Pedersen. “Developing new marketing options at a time when important outlets such as restaurants, retail and farmers’ markets are disrupted will help strengthen distribution of local food to Manitoba customers.”   	Canada and Manitoba will be providing a total of $160,000 through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership to Direct Farm Manitoba to purchase a software platform that will allow Manitobans to order food online from local producers and farmers’ markets. The funding will also go toward the development of a network of pickup and delivery options to connect consumers with their orders, and the development of COVID-19 safe handling and packaging practices for producers and processors.   	“Canadians have always been able to count on farmers for good, healthy food. It has never been more important for our food supply to be reliable and diverse,” said Phil Veldhuis, president, Direct Farm Manitoba. “We have been working hard to connect consumers directly to local farmers. We appreciate this investment to reinforce our local food system at this time of crisis.”   	The five-year, $3-billion Canadian Agricultural Partnership includes $2 billion for cost-shared strategic initiatives delivered by the provinces and territories and $1 billion for federal programs and services.

This has been effective in helping patients receive clinical care without a physical trip to a doctor’s office while also reducing the utilization of personal protective equipment.   	    	Today, in collaboration with medical leadership and Doctors Manitoba, the Manitoba government has added further time-limited tariffs for additional virtual services, including virtual primary care visits for residents of personal care homes who need routine care for chronic illnesses, ensuring they receive the care they need during the pandemic.    	    	These new clinical options for patients have been developed to address the significant drop in patient visits to a physician since the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Manitoba. It is expected that these new tariffs will permit physicians to continue to shift their clinical interactions with patients from in-person to a virtual setting. Use of these new tariffs will only be permitted when a virtual appointment is appropriate and demonstrates equal clinical-value to an in-person interaction between a physician and patient.    	    	“These new options will make it easier for physicians to provide care virtually during the pandemic, which is especially important in personal care homes,” said Dr. Jose Francois, provincial specialty lead in family medicine, Shared Health. “This will ensure physicians are able to provide continued quality care to vulnerable residents, helping them maintain their health while keeping them safe.”   	    	The minister noted the province has already made a $4.5-million investment in virtual therapy resources to support the needs of Manitobans during the pandemic. The AbilitiCBT program is a free and confidential virtual-therapy platform and has proven to be one of the most effective and efficient therapy methods available. In addition to this work, the province is introducing support for services by telephone or video to enable family physicians and specialists to help their patients Manitobans manage their mental health without having to leave home. Physicians will first direct patients seeking support for anxiety related to the pandemic to these on-line cognitive behavioural therapy resources unless there is an ongoing relationship with the patient.   	    	Further options introduced today include:   	• consultation by telephone or video to enable family physicians and specialists to help Manitobans manage their acute, chronic and complex health conditions;    	• consultation by developmental pediatricians for families who care for children with developmental difficulties, ensuring timely access to care from home; and    	• chronic pain management assessments and followup appointments to ensure people have safe access to these care needs.    	    	“The investments we are making today support the implementation of Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan by bringing health care closer to the patient in a timely way,” said Friesen. “This particularly supports health-care services for those in rural and remote communities, as well as Manitobans with mobility issues and other barriers to care.”   	    	The minister noted work is also underway to address how physicians can adapt their practices to provide services in other areas of the health-care system as needed during the pandemic.   	    	“While case numbers are currently stable, we must continue to plan for times during this pandemic where we may see increased case numbers and higher demands on the health-care system,” said Friesen. “By doing this work now, we will be in a better position to help Manitobans access the care they need, when and where they need it.”   	    	To access virtual therapy supports during the pandemic and for more information on COVID-19 in Manitoba, visit www.manitoba.ca/COVID19.   	    	A comprehensive list of Manitoba government COVID-19 measures can be found at:  https://manitoba.ca/bg/2020/04/covid19.html.   	    	- 30 -   	   BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

Trails can play an important role in our recovery and rebuilding following this pandemic.”   	    	With the assistance of Trails Manitoba, funding announced today will allow for the completion of six trails in Manitoba provincial parks, helping link the 1,755-kilometre Great Trail in Manitoba including:   	• South Whiteshell Trail;   	• South Whiteshell Trail – Penniac Bay;   	• Cabin Lake Creek Pedestrian Bridge;   	• Centennial Trail – Hansons Creek Bridge Phase 2;   	• North Whiteshell emergency repair washout; and   	• Spruce Woods Provincial Park.   	    	“Our government recognizes the positive impact in being able to connect with nature, now more than ever as Manitobans navigate this challenging time posed by the global health pandemic,” said Guillemard. “Trails Manitoba plays a valuable leadership role in the creation, maintenance and enhancement of trails across Manitoba, and we will continue to partner with organizations to provide Manitobans with more opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, all year long.”   	    	“We are very grateful to the Province of Manitoba for its long-standing support of our provincial trail network,” said Erik Dickson, president, Trails Manitoba. “This funding will help improve safety and accessibility in several beloved trails in our beautiful provincial parks as well as promotes sustainability in the adaptive re-use of two pedestrian bridges from Kings Park in Winnipeg.”   	    	Trails Manitoba was formed in 1993 to support growing interest in recreational trail development throughout the province.

Some examples include:  	•    The Winnipeg location of Winpak, a firm that manufactures and distributes packaging materials and machines, answered the call for the production of 100,000 protective face shields. The Winpak division team in Winnipeg sprung into action with a synchronized effort between departments to find the appropriate materials to make prototypes. Winpak also enlisted other local vendors including Sur Seal Packaging, Hillary Production Machining and MacDon Industries to provide additional materials and labour to assist in assembling all the components required for the face shields. Starting April 27, Winpak will delivering 10,000 face shields per week to the Manitoba government. These shields will then be distributed to front-line health-care workers.  	•    Icon Technologies of Winkler has retooled its facility, which normally produces after-market RV/motorhome parts and custom plastic products, and are now producing much-needed face shields for the health-care system. With a sharp drop in demand due to COVID-19, Icon was facing the possibility of having to lay off most of its 60 employees. By transitioning to the manufacturing of face shields, it has been able to keep its entire workforce employed with a production level of up to 6000 shields per day. These shields are being supplied to Manitoba facilities and other neighbouring jurisdictions as well.  	•    Decker Colony in western Manitoba is one of a number of Hutterite colonies that have collectively produced and shipped an estimated 30,000 fabric-based masks for health-care facilities and other organizations and groups across Manitoba. These colonies have also produced other fabric and plastic-based products including gowns, ear savers and surgery caps. In one instance, Seven Oaks General Hospital supplied 30 bolts of cloth, which was used to make 1,000 hospital gowns. In addition to health-care facilities, products supplied by Manitoba Hutterite colonies have also been distributed to a number of First Nations across southern Manitoba, a women’s shelter in Brandon and the Kidney Foundation of Manitoba.   	“These are just some of the many examples of Manitobans finding creative solutions to help combat COVID-19,” added Helwer. “I want to extend sincere thanks to all the businesses and organizations who have joined this effort and invite others that may be able to retool operations to consider doing so. By working together, we can help keep Manitobans safe and healthy.”   	The Manitoba government continues to call on manufacturers, businesses and other organizations to assist in procurement efforts.   	The province is asking manufacturers or businesses to visit the COVID-19 portal at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/index.html if:  	•    they can rapidly scale up production or retool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19; or  	•    they have a stock of personal protective equipment that is not being used due to closures and physical distancing.   	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition.

Our government will continue to support our most vulnerable citizens as we fight this pandemic together.”   	The federal CERB benefit will be treated as earned income under EIA. As a result, EIA clients who receive the CERB benefit will receive more than they would on EIA alone. They will also continue to receive prescription drug, dental and optical benefits regardless of whether they are still eligible for provincial social assistance. For example, by treating the CERB as earned income, a couple with two children will receive $2,270 per month under both programs while still qualifying for needed health benefits.   	In addition, individuals with disabilities who are new applicants to EIA will receive the same enhanced earnings exemption as existing clients. This change will make it easier for people with disabilities whose employment has been impacted by COVID-19 to receive EIA benefits in addition to the CERB.   	Families will also be able to keep the increased Canada Child Benefit and GST rebate without any impact to their EIA benefits, the minister noted.   	The province will work with clients to help them navigate the federal process and explain how it will affect their EIA benefits. This will include helping them resume receiving support from EIA once the CERB benefits end.   	The Manitoba government is taking all steps necessary to protect the health and safety of residents and reduce the spread of COVID-19. The EIA program continues to work with clients by telephone, email, fax, and online to provide support while helping to limit the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing.   	The EIA program has also extended coverage for health or medical needs, volunteer benefits and employment and training supports until further notice.   	Earlier this week, the Ontario minister of children, community and social services announced that his government would be treating the CERB as earned income for clients in the Ontario Works and Ontario Disability Support programs.

Case-by-case clinical assessment has ensured urgent and emergent procedures, as well as those patients who may become urgent or emergent during the postponement timeframe, are completed. Patient safety and avoiding negative outcomes remain the priority.   	Over the next week, a number of facilities across the province will begin to increase their surgical activity. This includes increased surgical activity at Health Sciences Centre, the Pan Am Clinic, Concordia Hospital, Misericordia Health Centre, Grace Hospital, St. Boniface Hospital, Victoria General Hospital, Boundary Trails Health Centre, Selkirk Regional Health Centre and Brandon General Hospital.   	Surgeries will be scheduled for the most urgent cases first and all necessary precautions, including point of care testing, appropriate PPE and limiting the number of staff in the room to those who are essential for patient care, will be taken to protect staff and patients from the risk of COVID-19. Patients will be contacted directly about scheduling their surgery.   	Manitoba is part of a national effort to share important medical equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) and has agreed to divert 100 vital sign monitors to Quebec and Ontario – two of the hardest-hit provinces in the fight against COVID-19.

The program is open to Manitoba students aged 15 to 29, with an employment period from May 1 to Sept. 4. Employers can be subsidized to hire up to five students. Reimbursement will be provided at the end of the employment period, upon proof of payment of student wages.   	Employers must place students in jobs that can be accommodated under current public health orders and be able to adapt to recommendations provided by public health officials over the summer.   	For the first two weeks of the program, priority will be given to employers who do not qualify for the various federal government assistance programs.  	     	“While we work toward carefully re-opening our economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, more opportunities will be available for students as the summer progresses,” said Pallister. “Our students need the support and experience, and the Summer Student Recovery Plan will help stimulate our economy and move Manitoba forward.”   	In addition to the subsidy program, Manitoba recently announced that it is deferring payments on student loans which will assist post-secondary students who are affected by the economic impact of COVID-19, the Premier noted.

This surplus is the result of fewer claims during this COVID period, coupled with strong year-end financial results. As a public insurance model, MPI operates on a break-even basis and is required to maintain its reserves at a level set by legislation. Today’s rebate is possible because MPI’s reserves are exceptionally strong, allowing excess capital to be returned to ratepayers while ensuring its reserves are fully funded.   	“This money is expected to provide financial assistance to Manitobans during this unprecedented crisis,” said Ben Graham, president and CEO, MPI. “We have made significant improvements in our operations to deliver value to Manitobans resulting in stronger financial results.   	“With a healthy reserve fund, MPI is in a strong financial situation to move forward with these rebate cheques to support our customers. This rebate to our customers will not adversely impact the corporation’s financial outcomes moving forward. It feels right to give back to our customers when they need it the most.”   	Details of the rebates will be made in the coming weeks and further details will be available at www.mpi.mb.ca/Pages/Home.aspx.   	In addition to rebating excess capital from the last financial year, MPI notes that as of mid-April, collision claims are down 48 per cent compared to the same month a year ago. MPI estimates that public health orders directing the public to stay at home and for non-essential businesses to cease direct interaction with the public have resulted in approximately $29 million in fewer basic claims being incurred between March 15 and April 15, 2020.   	Under existing legislation, MPI is able to return approximately $50 million to its ratepayers and will require the approval of the Public Utilities Board (PUB) for the additional $60 million. MPI will apply to the PUB in the coming days in respect of the incremental $60 million in order to be able to return these amounts to Manitoba ratepayers. If PUB approval is obtained in the next few weeks, the entire $110 million will be returned as part of the rebate cheques mailed to Manitobans.   	Based on current projections, MPI is confident that due to the extension of public health orders and the provincial state of emergency extending until May 18, related savings to the corporation will continue into the foreseeable future.   	- 30 -  "

This order was supplied by SpiritRx Services, a Manitoba-based medical supply company owned by the Spirit Healthcare Group representing the seven tribal councils of Manitoba.   	“The Spirit Healthcare Group was pleased to have had the opportunity to work with the Manitoba government,” said Heather Berthelette, CEO, Spirit Healthcare Group, and Chief Dennis Meeches, board chair. “Our First Nations, Manitoba-based company was able to source and supply this much-needed personal protective equipment required by the province.”   	“We want to thank all of our partners who helped ensure the successful delivery of this vitally important personal protective equipment,” Helwer said. “Our government will continue to source and acquire the PPE and other supplies needed to keep Manitobans safe and ensure that our province wins in the fight against COVID-19.”   	The Manitoba government continues to call on manufacturers, businesses and other organizations to assist in procurement efforts.   	The province is asking manufacturers or businesses to visit the COVID-19 portal at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/index.html if:  	•    they can rapidly scale up production or retool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19; or  	•    they have a stock of personal protective equipment that is not being used due to closures and physical distancing.

They are struggling right now and we want to support them,” said Pallister. “Our government has been listening and working diligently with chambers of commerce across the province, business and retail councils, industry and trade associations and various stakeholders to identity where the greatest need is and to maximize the recovery opportunities for Manitoba’s business sector.”   	The Manitoba Gap Protection Program (MGPP) is available to any of the approximately 120,000 businesses in Manitoba who have fallen into a gap in failing to qualify for the various federal government assistance programs and wage subsidies created because of COVID-19. If one in six businesses have fallen into that gap that would mean approximately 20,000 Manitoba businesses would be entitled to this support, the premier noted.  	   	The province will advance each eligible business the non-interest bearing forgivable MGPP loan of $6,000, for a total of up to $120 million. The loan will be forgiven on Dec. 31, 2020, if the recipient attests at that time the business has not received any major non-repayable COVID-19 federal supports such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Business Account, as well as sector-specific grant federal programs specifically developed in response to the pandemic. If the applicant has received benefits under a federal COVID program, then the loan will be added to the recipient’s 2020 tax bill.   	“We are acting on the advice from industry and are committed to working in partnership with our municipal and federal governments and various associations that are impacted by this pandemic so we’ll make the right decisions, in the right way, at the right time to maximize our recovery efforts for the benefit of all Manitobans,” said Pallister.   	To be eligible for the MGPP funding, a business must:  	•    have been operational on March 20, 2020, the date the Manitoba government declared a provincewide state of emergency under The Emergency Measures Act because of COVID-19;  	•    have temporarily ceased or curtailed operations as a result of a COVID-19 public health order and have been harmed by the health order;  	•    be registered and in good standing with the Manitoba Business and Corporate Registry;  	•    have not qualified for federal government COVID-19 grant support; and  	•    have an email address and a bank account.   	- 30 -  "

Cooler temperatures have slowed the melt and helped control high water in Manitoba, and we aren’t expecting any major spring storms in the week ahead.”   	The Red River has crested from Emerson to St. Jean Baptiste. Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 at Morris is expected to remain open, as an earthen ramp has been constructed at the north end of Morris so traffic can continue to use the highway. The river is expected to peak today at Morris, Ste. Agathe and St. Adolphe, and within the next 24 hours at the Red River Floodway inlet south of Winnipeg. A flood warning remains in place for the river from Emerson to the Red River Floodway inlet.   	Provincial crews were deployed in a number of communities in the Red River Valley to close ring dikes as required. Pumping operations are underway at most ring dike communities. Response teams are observing recommended public health measures for COVID-19.   	Operation of the floodway continues to reduce water levels in Winnipeg. The Red River level is around 18.7 feet at James Avenue with the crest forecast to arrive within the next two days at between 19 and 19.3 ft., maintained by floodway operation. The current flow in the floodway channel is almost 20,000 cubic feet per second.   	The Red River is now projected to return within bank in early May. The Red River Floodway will likely continue operations until mid-May depending on future weather conditions.   	The minister noted that levels are reducing along the Red River in North Dakota, currently at 18.2 ft. in Fargo and 35.6 ft. in Grand Forks. At this time, there is sufficient capacity in the channel to withstand a major storm.   	Downstream north of Winnipeg, the ice cleared out a few days ago so ice dam-related high water is no longer an issue. A high water advisory remains in place for the Red River from Lockport to Netley Creek as water levels remain high and will continue to rise as the peak moves down the river.   	Lake Winnipeg is at 714.9 ft. while Lake Manitoba is at 811.4 ft., both within operating levels. The province has issued, and will continue to issue, high wind and ice pileup warnings as required as the ice dissipates.   	The Assiniboine River and northern rivers such as the Saskatchewan and Carrot near The Pas are forecast to remain mostly in bank. The Assiniboine peak is forecast to reach Winnipeg tomorrow, with little or no influence on James Avenue levels in Winnipeg. Ice jams on the Saskatchewan and Carrot rivers could cause temporary over-bank high water. The Portage Diversion ceased operations yesterday.   	A number of roads are impacted by high water levels including parts of Provincial Road (PR) 217, PR 246 and PR 320. For detours and a complete list of closures, visit www.manitoba511.ca.

Public health officials advise Manitobans to stay home as much as possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This includes only travelling to the cottage or second residence if needed. If people must travel, they are encourage to:  	•    only travel with family members,  	•    not visit with others on arrival,  	•    avoid stopping for gas or other supplies on the way, and  	•    only visit local health-care providers in case of emergency.   	Manitoba health officials are taking every available and appropriate step to protect the province’s health-care workforce from exposure to COVID-19 so they are able to take care of sick and vulnerable Manitobans over the coming weeks and months. This includes steps to enhance screening at all health-care facilities, implement visitor restrictions, encourage virtual visit options and postpone non-essential services.   	Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a supplement to these and other measures including strict hand hygiene and both social and physical distancing.   	Similar to other jurisdictions, Manitoba has engaged experts in infection prevention and control, and occupational and environmental health and safety to identify the supplies required to protect workers in critical and priority services.   	Settings and situations have been categorized according to the level of risk to workers and to the population they are caring for and the required PPE has been set out accordingly. These include:  	•    green zones, which are settings and situations involving care or service for individuals who are not considered COVID-19 suspects;  	•    orange zones, which are settings and situations involving care or service for individuals who meet the criteria for COVID-19 testing, AND who have been tested AND whose results are pending; and  	•    red zones, which are settings and situations involving care or service for individuals who have been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19.   	To conserve PPE for health-care workers, public health officials are recommending all people who enter a health-care facility wear a cloth mask to protect others. In addition, patients and clients are encouraged to wear non-medical face masks during any health-care interaction, as well as when using public transit, handi-transit or a taxi.

It’s incumbent upon businesses like ourselves to do our part to actively help support financial recovery efforts over the next several months.”   	This is the second year the WCB has returned surplus funds to eligible employers while still maintaining the lowest assessment rate in Canada. In making this decision, the WCB’s board of directors considered the long-term financial projections in conjunction with maintaining rate stability and still protecting the workers compensation system against risk, uncertainty and market volatility.   	In May, eligible employers will receive a credit to their account based on 20 per cent of their 2019 premium. To be eligible to receive the surplus, employers must have fulfilled their payroll reporting responsibilities for 2019 and paid a WCB premium in 2019. Employers can still report their 2019 payroll to receive the surplus distribution.   	For the health-care sector, which includes regional health authorities and several other agencies such as CancerCare Manitoba, Riverview Health Centre and personal care homes, this equals an approximate $6.2-million refund.   	Of the $37 million, WCB expects $29 million will be returned to the private sector, with approximately $7 million going to small businesses in Manitoba.   	“We are proud the work we’ve done over the years to increase our system efficiency allows us to have the lowest WCB rate in Canada and we can now offer some measure of relief to employers suffering the financial hardships COVID-19 has created,” said Winston Maharaj, president and CEO, WCB. “We applaud all of the employers and front-line workers who continue to serve the public in these extremely challenging times.”   	Earlier this month, WCB announced it would defer premium payments until the end of May, not charge business interest and/or penalties for non-payment until October, extend the payroll-reporting deadline until the end of May and ensure that coverage remains active for accounts that choose to defer payments until the end of October. Clearances will remain in good standing.   	The WCB is a mutual workplace injury and disability statutory corporation funded by employer premiums. It insures more than 34,000 employers and 76 per cent of the Manitoba workforce.   	- 30 -  	   "

Funds are being used for purposes such as:  	•    purchasing significant amounts of essential medical supplies and equipment, including personal protective equipment;  	•    developing hotel capacity for those requiring isolation;  	•    preparing for large-scale low acuity medical overflow for hospitals;  	•    supporting the local, made-in-Manitoba production of gowns, scrubs, gloves and other medical equipment including an RFP to award $15 million of production to Manitoba-designed reusable silicone N95 masks;  	•    providing training and grants to child-care experts to become entrepreneurs by opening their own small-scale daycares;  	•    establishing a COVID-19 research fund through Research Manitoba;  	•    providing a new digital online service for mental health support;  	•    creating https://helpnextdoormb.ca/ to link Manitobans needing help with volunteers;  	•    engaging local call centre, 24-7 Intouch, to contact Manitobans to drive awareness of government support programs to small businesses, charities and not-for-profits; and  	•    opening multiple provincewide testing sites to bolster the response to this health crisis.   	“This new investment continues to address the needs of our front-line health-care workers and patients,” said Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen. “Our government is taking every step possible to protect Manitoba families and ensure people are able to get the care they need during this critical time.”   	The Manitoba government has also undertaken a number of investments to provide immediate relief to Manitobans facing financial challenges by deferring provincial fees and charges, funding support for child-care services for critical service providers and expanding shelter capacity to support people affected by homelessness, noted Helwer.   	The province is asking manufacturers or businesses to visit the COVID-19 portal at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/index.html if:  	•    they can rapidly scale up production or re-tool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19; or  	•    they have a stock of personal protective equipment that is not being used due to closures and physical distancing.

They mandate that anyone entering Manitoba, regardless of whether it was from another country or another province must self-isolate for 14 days. In addition, travel to northern Manitoba (north of the 53rd parallel of latitude) is prohibited with some exceptions including:  	•    residents of northern and remote communities may continue to move within the north;  	•    delivery of goods and services may continue; and  	•    exceptions include those who travel to the north for employment, medical treatment or to facilitate child-custody agreements.   	The new orders build on the current orders, and maintain the gathering size of no more than 10 people at any indoor or outdoor premises. Additional updates include:  	•    a clarification that businesses not listed as critical may operate, and have customers attend to pick up ordered items, providing social distancing measures are in place;  	•    a provision to allow farmers markets to operate, providing social distancing measures are in place;  	•    hotels may operate, but must close common areas such as pools, hot tubs and game rooms;  	•    campgrounds can provide accommodation to recreational vehicles that act as a primary residence;  	•    garden centres and greenhouses can operate, providing social distancing measures are in place; and  	•    appliance, electronic and furniture stores are excluded, and should not be open to the public, except where orders are placed remotely and orders are delivered or picked up with social distancing measures in place.   	The following restrictions remain in place as they were with previous orders:  	•    All restaurants and other commercial facilities are prohibited from serving food to customers in their premises. This prevents eat-in dining at all facilities. However, restaurants and other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or takeout. If this takes place, the operator of the restaurant must ensure that all people maintain the appropriate social distancing from other customers when picking up food.  	•    All businesses that are not listed in the schedule of critical services that accompanies the order must remain closed.  	-    This closure order does not prevent these businesses from operating on a remote basis.  	-    A business may accept orders on the internet or over the phone for delivery or pickup, as long as the employees are not working at the place of business.  	-    The order does not prevent employees or others from coming into the business to perform repairs, to provide security services or to take out items from the business premises if the business is going to operate on a remote basis.  	-    Nothing in the order restricts the operations of delivery of services by the federal or provincial governments or a municipality.  	-    Nothing in the order restricts any activities of a publicly funded agency, organization or authority that delivers or supports government operations or services including health-care services. This means the order does not affect institutions, agencies and other service providers offering health-care services such as hospitals, regional health authorities and private agencies that provide a range of health services.   	In addition, public health officials are expanding testing criteria to include:  	•    all symptomatic workers or volunteers at workplaces that have been identified as essential services; and  	•    any symptomatic person who lives with a health-care worker, first responder or worker in a congregate setting such as a correctional facility, shelter, long-term care or residential facility.

You are not alone, we will get through this together.”   	The AbilitiCBT program is a free and confidential virtual-therapy platform and has proven to be one of the most effective and efficient therapy methods available, the premier added.   	As of this morning, close to 600 individuals have registered for the program, and are now using the virtual-therapy platform with more signing up daily.    	The program is guided by professional therapists and addresses mild to moderate anxiety symptoms related to the uniquely challenging aspects of pandemics:  	•    uncertainty,  	•    physical isolation,  	•    caring for family and community members,  	•    information overload, and  	•    stress management.   	The program will help people:  	•    learn what anxiety is and how it affects their emotions, mind, body and behaviour;  	•    reduce anxiety by learning cognitive behavioral-therapy skills and using them to change responses to triggers; and  	•    develop coping strategies to track and reduce anxiety and better manage daily activities.   	The premier noted people do not need to be referred to the program by a doctor, they can start at any time by completing the online assessment on the website.   	Once people register online, they are asked to download an app, as well as to complete and submit a health-screening questionnaire. A therapist will reach out within three days to book an initial assessment by phone.   	People will then complete 10 modules on the app at their own pace, while the therapist tracks and monitors progress. There will be scheduled check-ins along the way by phone, chat or through a video check-in to make sure people are getting the help they need.   	The internet-based cognitive behavioural-therapy service is free of charge to all Manitobans 16 years old and over. Services are available in English and French. The program can be accessed at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.   	Crisis mental-health services continue to be available through partner organizations in Manitoba at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/crisis.html.

The Manitoba government cabinet’s new proclamation this week has brought into force provisions of the Business Names Registration Act, the Partnerships Act, the Corporations Act and the Cooperatives Act, as well as regulatory changes, to enable reciprocal registrations of businesses across the four provinces and an elimination of unnecessary and antiquated fees for them.   	The New West Partnership Trade Agreement commits each of the four western provinces to enhance trade, investment and labour mobility, and to remove barriers to the movement of goods, services, investment and people within and between the jurisdictions. Manitoba companies and families will benefit from improved business opportunities through the partnership, which covers more than 30 per cent of Canada’s population.   	“The potential through the New West Partnership for the creation of quality jobs is in step with our government’s Manitoba Works program, which aims to generate 40,000 new jobs in our province over the next four years,” said Eichler. “This trade agreement brings opportunities for new growth, and has long been called for by Manitoba business owners and chambers of commerce. It’s a chance for Manitoba to take advantage of its enormous potential with its resource wealth and its central location in Canada and North America.”   	Manitoba’s entry to the New West Partnership, which was formed in 2010 by the governments of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, strengthens and expands Canada’s largest, barrier-free interprovincial market. By adopting the agreement, Manitoba is strengthening its industries and positioning itself to prosper in the national economy while making families across the province safer and stronger.   	- 30 -  "

In this unique program, people with their own lived experience of mental health or addictions issues will be able to offer support and insight for others experiencing similar challenges.   	Peer support programs offer an evidence-based service that uses the expertise of trained staff with lived experience to support the recovery of people struggling with mental health and addictions.   	Support staff work with clients and families from initial contact through ongoing support and post-discharge followup.   	Peer 2 Peer Connections fits well within the new MSS vision of ‘Mental Wellness for All’ and its mission, which is “to provide quality mental health education and value-based peer support for Manitobans and their families dealing with mental health challenges”.   	The minister noted the implementation of this first for Manitoba program will meet a recommendation from the VIRGO report, which identified peer support in formal health-care settings as a short-term priority.

The Speaker of the legislative assembly is also granted authority to issue an order for independent officers of the assembly and members of the legislative assembly.   	Currently, only the minister or a local authority may make emergency orders of a limited scope that directly limit loss of life or damage to property and the environment.   	Penalties for violating The Emergency Measures Act would increase to a maximum of $100,000 and/or one year imprisonment for individuals and a maximum of $1,000,000 for corporations.   	A new provision would also give courts the option to increase the fine for a person convicted of a price gouging offence by an amount equal to the financial benefit acquired.   	The amendments authorizing the provincial government to make emergency orders would be temporary and automatically rescinded after one year, while the other order powers would remain within legislation.   	- 30 -  "

Half of the investment would be directly available for health-care costs, while $400 million would be available for allocation to new COVID-19 pandemic-related costs across the whole of government, allowing the flexibility to create new government programs or support services for Manitobans, or addressing increased costs under existing programs whose volumes have increased as a result of the pandemic.   	The province would also double the emergency expenditures budget with a second commitment of $100 million to address the costs of potential natural disasters later in the fiscal year, such as floods and forest fires, or even cover new emergency costs relating to the pandemic should they arise. The existing funding for emergency expenditures has been fully expended to cover COVID-19 costs.   	“We want to ensure we have available funds to meet anticipated and unexpected costs this fiscal year as a result of the pandemic,” said Finance Minister Scott Fielding. “We are closely monitoring the costs and resources required across government, such as procurement costs for PPE and other medical supplies for the health-care system, as well as funds needed by other departments, such as Manitoba Justice and Manitoba Families, to keep facilities safe for the Manitobans who rely on them.”   	The province is tracking all costs and expenses centrally for government departments and other reporting entities, and the premier noted full documentation of these additional funds spent will be provided in the second quarter financial update, nine months sooner than would normally occur.   	- 30 -  "

This authority is over and above what was presented in Budget 2020.   	The Manitoba government will also be introducing several new bills to support Manitoba’s most vulnerable and advocating for expedited passage of several existing bills to address the growing impacts of COVID-19 on Manitobans.   	“We are taking concrete steps to move forward the Manitoba Protection Plan to help ensure we are doing everything we can to support Manitobans during this unprecedented and difficult time,” said Pallister. “We are demonstrating that Manitoba is Canada’s most resilient province and together, we will get through this.”   	To ensure compliance with current two-metre social distancing measures, during today’s sitting, all parties have agreed to limit attendance to one-third of the 57 members of the legislative assembly. Members will not be seated at their usual desks, but rather be spread throughout the chamber to abide by two-metre social distancing measures.

The province is also proposing new provisions to the Employment Standards Code that would allow employees to be away from work for specified reasons related to COVID-19.   	After consulting the Labour Management Review Committee, which made a consensus recommendation to provide job protection for employees affected by COVID-19, the province is moving forward with changes that would allow employees protected leave for eligible purposes.   	Employees would be able to take as much unpaid time off work as needed to:  	•    be in isolation or quarantine or take any other control measure in accordance with information or directions related to COVID-19 by health professionals, health officers, Health Links–Info Santé, the government of Manitoba or the Government of Canada, a municipal council or a board of health;  	•    obtain medical examination, supervision or treatment;  	•    comply with an order made under The Emergency Measures Act or The Public Health Act;  	•    provide care or support to a family member as a result of COVID-19, including but not limited to, school and daycare closures; or  	•    comply with travel restrictions.   	The new provisions would apply to any leave that started between March 1, 2020, and a date to be prescribed in regulation, specified once the pandemic is over.   	“We want to reassure Manitobans they won’t lose their job for taking leave to comply with public health orders to self-isolate or to seek medical attention or care for a loved one because of COVID-19,” said Pallister. “We all have a role to play in flattening COVID curve and we are committed to helping Manitobans navigate this challenging and unprecedented time.”   	The provisions also allow for other communicable diseases to be added by regulation to allow the new leave provisions to be re-instated in cases of future epidemics or pandemics.   	The Manitoba government will also be meeting with Manitoba’s public sector union leaders to discuss an ‘all-hands-on-deck’ approach response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The province is seeking ways to defer non-essential spending across all of government to ensure its ability to redirect resources to front-line health services during this critical time, the premier added.   	“Manitobans have every right to expect that their government will do everything it can to address and support our pandemic response and our health-care workers in the front lines,” said Pallister. “We expect that our public service will want to do the right thing to support these efforts and to make sure resources are where they are, when they are needed most.”   	In the coming days and weeks ahead, the province will be exploring and discussing various options to reduce non-essential spending, with the primary focus of mitigating the impact and fallout of COVID-19, the premier stated.

Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer continues to stress that Manitobans need to adhere to social distancing practices and should stay home as much as possible to help flatten the COVID curve.   	“At this time, we believe the general use of parks and trails is a low risk activity for Manitobans,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer.  “With the closure of washrooms and other dedicated gathering space within our provincial parks, the opportunity to congregate in groups of more than 10 people is significantly minimized.”   	The province is not ruling out additional measures or further broader park area closures if social distancing becomes problematic, especially in parks close to urban centres, the premier noted.   	Meantime, the Manitoba government has launched its new, online service for the sale of outdoor licences and permits, the premier announced.  The province recognizes this is a significant change in the way Manitobans will access licences and park permits so it will be phased in, starting with hunting and angling licenses as well as provincial park vehicle permits, which are now available online.   	“While we are in an unprecedented time of social distancing and isolation, we recognize that hunting and fishing are important aspects of daily life for many Manitobans across our beautiful province,” said Pallister.  “This enhanced service with the option to purchase these products online supports our continued effort to ensure the health and well-being of all Manitobans during this global health pandemic.”   	Benefits of using an e-licensing approach include:  	•    access 24 hours a day, seven days a week online or by telephone;     	•    access through participating retailers (list available online);  	•    the ability to immediately purchase and print licenses and permits at home;  	•    the ability to reprint lost or damaged licenses;  	•    receiving email confirmation of licences/permits purchased; and  	•    improved data collection that will support program management.   	In addition to current base licence fees, an administration fee of $4.50 will be included in all licences and permit purchases to support enhanced service delivery, with the exception of the Manitoba Resident Seniors Conservation Angling Licences that will remain free of charge.   	As the weather warms up, Manitobans are encouraged to embrace the outdoors while practising good social distancing when using parks, trails and other public greenspaces, the premier added.

Beginning on Tuesday, April 14, all parents who work in critical services, as defined by the chief provincial public health officer, will be eligible to access child-care spaces available in licensed facilities.  This includes support staff at hospitals and clinics, grocery store staff, farmers and farm workers, construction workers, bank or credit union employees.  Starting Friday, parents working in these sectors who have been unable to make other child-care arrangements will be able to go to www.manitoba.ca/covid19 to see which facilities have spaces and work directly with them to secure child care.   	The minister encouraged licensed child-care facilities that want to help by re-opening or continuing to have spaces available to notify the province by submitting an updated facility status form through Manitoba Child Care Online at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/childcare/index.html.   	The full provincial operating grant, over $30 million, continued to flow to all licensed child-care facilities on April 1.  The Government of Canada has also confirmed that child-care centres are eligible for the federal emergency wage subsidy, which provides up to 75 per cent of employee wages for businesses and non-profits.   	“Our government is providing child-care centres and home-based providers with the support they need to continue operating during this difficult time,” said Stefanson.  “We will continue to do what we can to ensure that vital critical services workers can access child care so that they continue working on the front lines of this pandemic.”   	The Manitoba government also launched an $18-million grant program to help early childhood educators begin independently offering child-care services in their homes or in the community, administered by the Winnipeg and Manitoba chambers of commerce.  Early childhood educators can apply for the grant by filling out the Temporary Child Care Service Grant Form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/temporary-child-care-service-grant/.   	Manitoba continues to follow the advice of the chief provincial public health officer, who has advised that licensed child-care centres can continue to provide services to children as long as the care is limited to no more than 16 children per centre.  Some larger centres with segregated rooms and separate external entrances are able to offer care for up to 16 children per room.  Home-based child-care providers can also continue to operate with up to eight children.   	Manitoba has distributed a COVID-19 practice guideline outlining the hygiene and other recommended measures for child care in Manitoba.  In addition, Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, has provided a circular to all centres advising them of infection prevention protocols during this time and will be available to answer questions from child-care centres and providers next week.  The province is also committed to providing child-care providers with additional supplies and equipment to help prevent the spread of the virus as recommended by public health officials, the minister noted.   	Parents are reminded that children experiencing cold or flu symptoms, have travelled in the last 14 days or who have been exposed to others with a confirmed case of COVID-19 cannot be dropped off at a child-care facility and should remain at home.   	All screening for suspected cases of the virus are to be referred to Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) 1-888-315-9257.  The most up-to-date information on COVID19 can be found at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

Effective immediately, fine amounts for breaching these emergency orders will be set at $486 for individuals and $2,542 for businesses.   	Manitoba will be implementing a multi-tiered enforcement approach to enforcing orders, which will include public education, written warning or ultimately, enforcement actions such as ticketing or arrest if necessary, the premier said.   	In Winnipeg, the province is working in close collaboration with the City of Winnipeg, which will utilize Community Service Ambassadors to participate in public education and awareness, with bylaw officer and support from the Winnipeg Police Service (WPS) where required.   	“I want to thank all those who are doing their part by staying home, practising physical distancing and respecting the measures put in place by the Manitoba government,” said Bowman.  “While most in our community are doing their part, there are some who are not getting the message.  I hope education and awareness will be sufficient and enforcement won’t be required but in the event it is, these measures will help protect the safety of Winnipeggers.”   	To support these efforts, Manitoba Justice is partnering with City of Winnipeg to create enforcement units, with WPS acting in an assistance role, in ‘Operation Safe Apart’.  These units will be dedicated to enforcing orders along with providing awareness and prevention, responding to complaints and supporting bylaw enforcement officers.   	In Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made by calling: 311 or by email at 311@winnipeg.ca, or Twitter: @cityofwinnipeg.   	Measures involving public health officers working in conjunction with local police services, First Nation police services and the RCMP are also in place for municipalities outside of Winnipeg.  Plans are underway to expand these and adopt measures similar to those announced today for Winnipeg.  These include engaging municipal bylaw officers, community and First Nation safety officers, community volunteer groups such as Citizens on Patrol, and Manitoba Conservation officers who will work with respective police services.   	Outside of Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made to the Manitoba Government Inquiry (MGI) inquiry line at 204-945-3744, (toll-free) at 1-866-626-4862 or by email at mgi@gov.mb.ca.   	“We must to everything we can to protect our most valuable service – our health-care system –and our most vulnerable citizens,” said Pallister.  “These orders will help save lives and changing how we ensure compliance will help us flatten the COVID curve.”   	More information about Manitoba’s response to COVID-19 is available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/soe.html.   	- 30 -  "

The My Learning at Home/Mon Apprentissage Chez Moi portal can be found at www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/mylearning/index.html.   	The provincial Department of Education appreciates the continued assistance and collaboration of school division administrators and trustees, principals, teachers and support staff as they all work with families for the benefit of students across Manitoba during the suspension of in-school classes.  Together, they are helping develop ways for Manitoba students to learn at home to complete the 2019-20 school year.   	Meanwhile, the province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer during the pandemic, and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols and the three Ps – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

Water from the Red River began to spill into the Red River Floodway naturally on April 7.  The initial operation is the first of several that will roll the gates off the river bed and push more water into the floodway inlet.  The gates will be raised in stages in accordance with Rule 1 of the floodway operating guidelines, which outlines normal spring operation.   	The province has issued a high water warning for the Red River from Emerson to the Red River Floodway inlet, just south of the city of Winnipeg, as the river is close to spilling its banks in most of the region.  A high water watch has been issued for the Red River from Lockport to Netley Creek due to potential of some overland water in low-lying areas due to ice jamming.   	A warning is issued when river or lake levels are exceeding or are expected to exceed flood stage within the next 24 hours, whereas a watch is issued when river or lake levels are approaching and likely to reach flood stage, but unlikely within the next 24 hours.   	The forecast peak flow of Red River at the floodway inlet, without further significant precipitation, is estimated to be between 68,000 and 74,000 cubic feet per second.  The Red River is forecast to reach levels close to 2006 spring levels between Emerson and Letellier, and between 2006 and 2019 spring levels north of Letellier along the river.   	Water levels are expected to peak at Emerson between April 15 and 20 with the peak expected to reach the Red River Floodway between April 19 and 24.  With the operation of the floodway, the Red River level in Winnipeg at James Avenue is expected to peak between 19 and 19.5 feet between April 13 and 17.   	Provincial crews are deployed in a number of communities in the Red River Valley to prepare for potential ring dike closures.  Dike closures are anticipated over the weekend at West Lynn and Noyse.  Partial dike closures may also be required along PR 201 on the east side of Letellier and at St. Jean Baptiste.     	The minister is reminding property owners to protect wells as high water rolls through the Red River Valley.  If local sandbagging is required, the province has shared suggested safety measures with municipalities for crews to maintain COVID-19 safety procedures that can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/emo/.   	Water levels along the Assiniboine, Souris and Pembina rivers are relatively low with no significant flooding issues.  The Portage Diversion continues to operate to reduce downstream ice-jam impacts.  Small ice jams may occur in Winnipeg at some of the Assiniboine River bridges.  Major lakes in Manitoba are within normal or desirable operating ranges.   	Updated forecast information is available at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/floodinfo/index.html.

The minister noted the development of the fund builds on funding for other research opportunities during the pandemic including:  	•    the University of Manitoba investigating how logistical systems can adapt to a pandemic;  	•    developing a cost-effective, point-of-need diagnostic test for COVID-19 at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health; and  	•    developing a COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Manitoba.   	“While we have learned a great deal about this virus in just a few months, there are many more questions that need to be answered,” said Friesen.  “These investments will help contribute to the world’s understanding of the virus and make important strides toward vaccines, treatments and possible changes to our health system to better combat COVID-19.”   	Manitobans who wish to participate in the clinical trial can visit www.covid-19research.ca for additional details.

Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 477 tests Tuesday.  A total of 14,708 tests have been performed since early February.   	Manitobans should not interpret current case numbers to mean the risk is reduced.  The current statistics may be a reflection of the effect strict social distancing measures have had and reaffirms that these measures must be continued.  Manitobans are reminded this is not the time to let their guard down.  Actions taken today will affect case numbers in the weeks ahead.  All Manitobans must remain vigilant to flatten the curve of this virus.  This weekend is normally busy with gatherings for Easter or Passover celebrations.  However, families are reminded that gatherings with anyone from outside your household are strongly discouraged.   	Manitobans are reminded to continue seeking care for regular and chronic medical conditions.  Primary care and community health offices continue to be available for those patients in need of care, with virtual (phone and video) options available as well as in person appointments and walk-in services.   	The first Community COVID-19 Testing Site and Assessment Clinic in Winnipeg opened today at the St. James Assiniboia Centennial Pool and Fitness Centre, 644 Parkdale St.  With the opening of this site, Access Winnipeg West will once again focus on primary care and community health services and no longer be a designated community testing site for COVID 19.   	Assessment clinics for COVID-19 positive patients offer primary care services on an appointment basis for anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or has respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat or shortness of breath.   	In addition to the primary care space, these locations will also serve as designated testing sites in a separate area at the site to support additional capacity for testing.   	Testing sites and assessment clinics will NOT be walk-in services.  People seeking testing should still call Health Links-Info Santé first or be referred by their primary care provider.

Over the next six months, this change could benefit more than 280 youth in care and more than 70 young adults with agreements.   	The minister noted Manitoba Housing will also make 10 additional units available to provide stable, secure housing to young adults who are aging out of care and other youth in contact with the child welfare system.  Building on an existing partnership, these units will be set aside for clients of Resource Assistance for Youth.   	“The steps the government has taken today for youth aging out of care will help us protect at-risk young people during this difficult time,” said Kelly Holmes, executive director, Resource Assistance for Youth.  “We are all in this together and we appreciate the timely response from the government during this time of crisis.”   	A number of other changes have been put in place to support children in care and the child welfare system during the COVID-19 response.  Foster home and residential care licenses will be extended for 60 days, to ensure continuation of care.  The province has activated a mutual aid agreement with child welfare authorities, to help ensure staff and supports are available when they are needed.  The province also continues to share current, accurate information about best practices for children, families, care providers and other partners, based on public health advice.

Manitoba Economic Development and Training had been scheduled to receive a total of about $1 million in repayments on April 1 from Manitoba Student Aid borrowers.  The suspension of repayments from April 1 through Sept. 30 will defer the collection of up to $7 million for 2020-21.   	“Manitobans carrying student loan debt have become vulnerable to programming and labour market changes resulting from COVID-19,” said Eichler.  “This deferral of loan repayments is going to significantly lessen the hardship for them, at a time when they really need it.”   	Manitoba Student Aid loan disbursements, including tuition and grant payments, will continue to be made to students as scheduled while repayments are suspended.  During the deferral period, the program will accept payments from borrowers who choose to repay loans through cheque or electronic fund transfers.   	The overall impact of COVID-19 on Manitoba Student Aid will be assessed as the situation evolves.   	Meanwhile, the province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer during the pandemic, and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols and the three Ps – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

The Business Council of Manitoba has also written the prime minister expressing its support for the premier’s initiative.   	“The proposed solution provides increased liquidity and flexibility during this crisis while ensuring the greatest value for money during the recovery and moving forward,” said Bram Strain, president and CEO, Business Council of Manitoba.  “This truly levels the playing field for all jurisdictions and sets a foundation for us to begin to move forward, stronger and together.”   	Manitoba and other provinces are going to hit a financial wall requiring borrowing well beyond anything in the past, the premier said.  With every government competing for the same dollars, federal borrowing on behalf of provinces can give us access to greater financial liquidity in the bond markets at a cheaper cost than provinces doing it solely on their own, he added.   	This year alone, Manitoba expects borrowing needs of up to $10 billion, Pallister said.  This is necessary to support front-line COVID health-care and family expenses, fill the holes created by revenue and bill deferrals with the current fall in economic activity, and pay for ongoing expenses of government, he added.  If Manitoba could save 1.5 per cent on these borrowing costs, that translates to $150 million a year that could be redirected to health care.  Over the 30-year term of those bonds, that translates to over $4 billion of savings for Manitobans for this year’s borrowings alone, the premier stated.  Across all Canadian provinces and territories, this could easily translate into over $100 billion of savings.   	“The federal government has been innovative and responsive in dealing with the fallout from COVID-19 on behalf of Canadians,” said Pallister.  “This is another, increasingly urgent way we can adopt a ‘Team Canada’ approach to fight this pandemic together, as we are doing right here in Manitoba with all our partners, to ensure we all come out of this pandemic stronger and more united than ever.”   	- 30 -  BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

The province is also issuing a call to businesses who have a stock of personal protective equipment.  If the equipment is not being used due to closures and physical distancing, they can also reach out by visiting the portal at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.  	   	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition.  For more info, visit: https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/.  Cash Flow Tax Relief   	Today’s measures will provide immediate relief to Manitobans facing financial challenges by deferring provincial fees and charges, the premier noted.   	As part of the Manitoba Protection Plan, the province is providing the following protections for the next six months until Oct. 1:  	•    instructing Manitoba Hydro, Centra Gas and Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) to not charge interest or penalties in the event that Manitobans are unable to pay at this time;  	•    instructing MPI to relax ordinary practices on policy renewals and collections;  	•    instructing Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries not to charge interest on receivables from restaurants, bars and specialty wine stores;  	•    supporting Workers Compensation Board (WCB) to do the same and asking WCB to extend relief from penalties for late payments;  	•    directing Manitoba Hydro and Centra Gas to not disconnect customers during these times; and  	•    working with municipal partners to ensure municipalities do not charge interest on provincial education taxes and school division fees and the province is encouraging municipalities to do the same with respect to their own taxes and will start discussions to support implementation.   	The government is also deferring provincial income tax and corporate income tax filing deadlines and payments to coincide with the current revised federal deferral of income tax to Aug. 31 and has indicated it would be willing to extend these deferrals until Oct. 1, should the federal government agree, the premier added.   	The new measures are in addition to the recently announced two-month deferral for small businesses that remit up to $10,000 in Manitoba payroll tax or $10,000 in sales tax.  This will result in $80 million in deferred remittance to the province.   	Pallister also announced plans to help make insurance more affordable for Manitobans.  While the province has no ability to allow for deferrals of payments or the waiver of interest charges and penalties, Manitoba is taking steps to make home and business property insurance more affordable to Manitobans by accelerating the removal of $75 million of annual PST from residential and business properties, effective July 1.     	This will save residential property owners an estimated $38 million per year and business property owners $37 million a year.  Expanded Shelter Capacity     	The Manitoba government will add more than 140 new shelter beds to support people affected by homelessness and allow for social distancing protocols as part of the province’s broader Manitoba Protection Plan response to COVID-19, the premier announced.   	“While many of us have the capacity to shelter at home, the reality is some of us do not,” said Pallister.  “Through our Manitoba Protection Plan, our government will ensure people who don’t have a stable home have a place to stay safe and healthy as we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic together.”   	Up to $1.2 million will be invested at several locations in Winnipeg to:  	•    repurpose a vacant Manitoba Housing building on Sargent Avenue to create 31 new beds;  	•    add 35 beds provided by the Salvation Army at its Martha Street location;  	•    expand Siloam Mission’s capacity by 50 beds; and  	•    move individuals currently using the Salvation Army’s SonRise Village to alternate locations, making its 26 beds available for new clients.   	The beds at the Sargent Avenue location will be managed by Main Street Project, which is partnering with other shelters to co-ordinate access among their clients.  This location will open today and others will become available as soon as possible.   	The provincial building on Sargent Avenue may also be used as self-isolation units for homeless individuals who need it.   	The premier noted the province is also looking into additional options to support homeless and vulnerable people outside of Winnipeg as part of the province’s Manitoba Protection Plan response to COVID-19.   	“Our government remains committed to looking at every possible way to help all Manitobans through these uncertain times, by providing financial relief and support needed on the front line as we face this global pandemic together.”   	The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols.

The province will continue to monitor conditions on the upper Assiniboine River as well as downstream river levels.      	The Hydrologic Forecast Centre is also advising the public of potentially hazardous ice conditions on rivers, lakes and drainage ditches throughout Manitoba as the spring thaw progresses.   	Use of the rivers, lakes, floodways or drainage ditches for activities such as skiing, sledding and snowmobiling could be hazardous at this time and should be avoided.  People living near waterways should be especially careful to prevent children and pets from wandering onto the ice.   	Daily temperatures are warming gradually and are causing ice thickness and strength to deteriorate.  The quality of river ice within communities is also uncertain, so citizens are advised to stay off rivers and retention ponds.   	- 30 -  "

Last month, the government also announced new programs to expand home and community-based child care, including an $18-million grant program to help early childhood educators begin independently offering child-care services at their homes or in the community, administered by the Winnipeg and Manitoba chambers of commerce.  The chambers will also offer business mentorship to early childhood educators looking to open up their homes or other locations in the community to provide child care.  Early childhood educators can apply for the grant by filling out the Temporary Child Care Service Grant Form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/temporary-child-care-service-grant/.   	“It is not too late to step up and help out, whether you are operating in a child-care centre or in your own home,” said Stefanson.  “Our government is providing financial support to child-care centres and early childhood educators during this difficult time, and we will continue to support the child-care sector so that we can help ensure health-care and other emergency services workers can continue working during this pandemic.”   	All child-care centres have also been asked by the province to reimburse parent fees if care has not been provided and to not charge parents to hold spots if they are not being used, the minister added.   	Licensed child-care centres will continue to be limited to 16 spaces to support social distancing and infection prevention measures based on the advice of the chief provincial public health officer.  Some larger centres with segregated rooms and separate external entrances are able to offer care for up to 16 children per room.  This will continue indefinitely in alignment with the decision regarding kindergarten to Grade 12 schools.   	“If you are a front-line health-care or other emergency services worker, we want to hear from you,” said Stefanson.  “Staff will continue working around the clock to ensure that you can get the child care that you need so you can continue working during this pandemic, after which we will be expanding service to all critical services workers as defined by the chief provincial public health officer.”   	Health-care and other emergency services workers can apply for a child-care space by filling out the request form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/GoMCovid19ESW/.  These parents, which include health-care providers, emergency service providers, corrections workers, law enforcement workers, fire and paramedic workers, and direct social services and child protection workers, should submit their request to be matched with a child-care spot by Wednesday, April 8, so that they can be prioritized for placement.  Families that have already submitted a request do not need to complete the form again, as the province is already working to match them with an available space.   	Beginning on Tuesday, April 14, all parents who work in critical services, as defined by the chief provincial public health officer, will be able to access child-care spaces available in licensed facilities.  This includes support staff at hospitals and clinics, grocery store staff, farmers and farm workers, construction workers, bank or credit union employees.  Parents working in these sectors who have been unable to make other child-care arrangements will be able to check which facilities have available spaces at www.manitoba.ca/covid19 and work directly with them to receive a spot.

The data also shows:  	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized including four in intensive care,  	•    11 individuals have recovered from COVID-19, and  	•    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba remains at one.   	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 1,300 tests Wednesday.  As of April 2, a total of 11,327 tests have been performed.   	Three additional staff across two Manitoba health-care facilities have tested positive for COVID-19.  The confirmed cases, at Health Sciences Centre (HSC) Winnipeg and Betel Home Gimli are being investigated by public health, occupational health and infection prevention and control officials.  All affected health-care workers are being provided with appropriate direction related to self-isolation or self-monitoring, depending on their exposure.   	As a result of the positive COVID-19 case at Betel Home in Gimli, public health officials are also investigating a respiratory illness outbreak among residents there.  Nine residents showing symptoms of respiratory illness are being tested for the cause of their illnesses.  This will include testing for COVID-19.  The home has implemented additional infection prevention and control measures to isolate affected patients.   	A change in protocol will soon require health-care workers working in patient care roles at facilities, including at hospitals, long-term care facilities, health centres, nursing stations, Access Centres and COVID-19 testing locations, to expand their use of procedure masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE).  These changes will be implemented over the coming days at sites across the province.  Manitoba’s provincial COVID-19 central supply chain management is working with regions and facilities to identify and ship appropriate PPE.   	New screening procedures are being implemented for staff working in acute and long-term care facilities.  Implementation of these measures has begun and will involve asking staff about travel history, exposure to COVID-19 positive cases, any symptoms they may have and having their temperature taken at the start of their shift.  Staff who are required to come and go during the course of their shift may be re-screened upon re-entry into facilities and service areas.   	Public health is also advising that people remain within or close to their home communities.  This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only.  Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.   	As Manitoba’s health system continues with preparations to ensure it is prepared to meet the needs of patients and to ensure appropriate protection from COVID-19 is available to health-care workers, donations of the following supplies are now welcome:  	•    N95 respirators of various models and sizes, both hospital and industrial grade;  	•    surgical/procedure masks;  	•    gloves;  	•    disposable gowns; and  	•    disinfectants and cleaners.

In cases that do proceed to court, Manitoba Justice will be launching new testimonial aids for victims, including ‘soft’ rooms with video-conferencing technology that enable remote testimony, the minister said.  These spaces are designed to provide a comfortable, safe environment to testify, which can protect victims against some of the traumatizing impacts of the court process.  They will be located in several Manitoba Justice Victim Services’ offices around the province.   	The province will use social media to share information about available supports and resources throughout the month of April, and Manitobans can participate in the discussion using the hashtags #SAAM2020, #SupportSurvivors and #YouAreNotAlone.   	In addition, the Manitoba government’s You Are Not Alone webpage is updated regularly and Manitobans are encouraged to go to www.gov.mb.ca/youarenotalone/ for more information on available supports, health information, police information and information on consent.

Under The Public Health Act, new public health orders announced earlier this week take effect today.  In addition, the chief provincial public health officer has clarified a public health order to ensure a better understanding for businesses classified as not providing critical services and how they are able to operate during the state of emergency.   	All non-exempt businesses may:  	•    continue to operate where customers can order goods online or by telephone; however, customers cannot attend the businesses’ premises or property to order goods;  	•    continue to sell goods to customers where those goods can be picked up ‘curbside’ or delivered to customers; however, customers cannot pick up goods at businesses’ premises or on its property;  	•    allow staff to attend the businesses’ premises, without a limitation on the number of staff, as long as staff take measures to keep social distancing of one to two metres apart from each other; and  	•    accept delivery of goods and may allow services, such as construction, repairs, maintenance and cleaning to occur at their premises and on their property.   	Additional details are available at https://engagemb.ca/.   	Manitoba Justice continues to take steps to reduce the spread of infection and enhance access to justice throughout the province.  As of April 2, new admissions to all adult and youth correctional centres in Manitoba will be handled through the Winnipeg Remand Centre (WRC).  All individuals coming into custody will be isolated for up to 14 days to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 into facilities.  Sheriff services will be assisting rural police agencies with transports whenever possible.  All in-person visits for people in Manitoba’s adult and youth correctional centres have been suspended including inmate programs, staff training and other group activities.   	The province is expanding the number of free phone calls for individuals in custody to help them maintain contact with their support systems.  Lawyers are encouraged to meet with clients remotely, whenever possible, but in-person visits with clients can continue at all facilities, with the exception of the WRC.  Cleaning procedures in all Manitoba’s correctional centres have increased significantly including the use of fogging equipment to disinfect large and high-traffic areas.  Protocols for the use of personal protective equipment are in place to ensure the safety of staff and inmates.   	As of April 2, greater access to bail hearings on evenings and weekends will increase the efficiency of the system, ensure timely bail and other hearings and limit unnecessary admissions to the WRC.  Crown attorneys will work on evenings, overnight and on weekends for consultations and hearings and to work with defence counsel on sentencing recommendations.  The province is also working with police agencies to expand remote bail hearings in the north.  The number of court hearings that can be held by phone will also be increased to avoid unnecessary transportation of people out of their communities.   	Public health is also advising that people remain within or close to their home communities.  This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only.  Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

The Manitoba government is investing $800,000 and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) is investing more than $465,000 in three research projects including:  	•    investigating how logistical systems can adapt to a pandemic at the University of Manitoba;  	•    developing a cost-effective, point-of-need diagnostic test for COVID-19 at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health; and  	•    developing a COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Manitoba.   	In addition, the province’s first COVID-19 clinical trial for a drug is underway.  The study will test if a rheumatological drug known as hydroxychloroquine can prevent people from contracting COVID-19.  The scientific trial will determine if the drug can safely be used as a treatment for COVID-19.   	People who are eligible are:  	•    people who have tested positive for COVID-19,  	•    people who live with individuals who test positive, and  	•    health-care workers who were exposed to patients with confirmed positive infection.

Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre reports with favourable conditions, water levels similar to the spring of 2019 are expected.  Last year, the Red River Floodway was put into service but Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 from Winnipeg south to Emerson remained open.   	Average weather conditions in spring 2020 would result in water levels similar to 2006 on the Red River, according to forecasters.  In that year, PTH 75 was closed for 18 days.  Unfavourable weather could lead to a run-off nearing 2011 levels.  In 2011, PTH 75 was closed for 28 days.   	The minister noted the province has invested nearly $80 million in flood mitigation measures through the Red River Valley over the past four years.  Projects include:  	•    $31 million for raising northbound lanes of PTH 75 south from St. Jean Baptiste to Morris to 2009 flood levels and improving drainage;  	•    $15.5 million for reconstructing the Plum River bridge in the northbound lanes of PTH 75 near St. Jean Baptiste;  	•    $10.3 million for reconstructing the Marsh River bridge on PTH 23 east of Morris;  	•    $4.2 million for reconstructing the Little Morris River bridge on PR 422 near Rosenfeld;    	•    a $1.3-million project will raise PR 205 in the vicinity of Rosenort and this ongoing project is scheduled for completion in October 2020;  	•    a $1-million project will raise PR 422 in the vicinity of Rosenort, scheduled to be completed in October 2020;  	•    a $8.3-million bridge is under construction over the Aux Marais River on PR 201 with a scheduled completion date of fall 2020;  	•    a $7.8-million concrete culvert replacement project is underway over the Kronsgart Drain on PTH 75 and is expected to be completed by fall 2020; and  	•    a $1-million steel culvert replacement project for the Aubigny Drain on PR 246 is complete and open to traffic.   	The minister noted that considerable provincial resources are involved in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 and officials have contingency plans in place if the approaching spring thaw requires preparations for high water management.     	The delivery of emergency services continues with appropriate personal protection during this COVID-19 episode and any high water response will be developed with COVID-19 in mind.  Safe work procedures are being finalized to ensure the safety of all response workers and maintain social distancing in producing sandbags and building dikes if required, the minister said.  	   	“The government has also recently announced the most emergency-ready budget in Manitoba history with additional financial provisions for COVID-19 and any other emergencies we may face,” said Schuler.  “Manitobans have dealt with many emergencies in the past, and we will be prepared for any high-water event that may develop over the coming weeks.”   	The second 2020 Spring Thaw Outlook report will be available at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/floodinfo/index.html.   	    	- 30 -  "

Under the revised restrictions, a vehicle may transport essential commodities at normal loading on highways that are subject to Level 1 road restrictions. Additionally, essential commodities may be transported at normal loading on roads subject to Level 2 restrictions, under the following conditions:  	•    If the highway links two points on the vehicle’s itinerary that are less than 10 kilometres apart, or in any other case if the highway is the most direct route between a point on the itinerary and the nearest highway that is not subject to Level 2 road restrictions.  A point on the itinerary means that the vehicle is picking up, or dropping off a load on that Level 2 restricted highway.  	•    If the essential commodities are transported between midnight and noon during the first 14 days of this restriction order, or at any time of the day after the 14th day.   	Vehicles that are travelling empty to pick up essential commodities, or travelling empty after having delivered them, may travel at any time of the day at Level 1 weights on highways that are subject to Level 2 road restrictions, if they comply with the above-noted conditions.   	Essential commodities include groceries, medical supplies, fuel, fertilizer, bulk milk, potable water for non-industrial use, emergency equipment and materials, and mail delivery on behalf of the Canada Post Corporation.  It also includes livestock and livestock feed in transit, and hay for feed in transit within Manitoba.     	For the 2020 Spring Road Restrictions season, a permit is not required to transport grain to satisfy grain quotas or contracts, or to transport potatoes or vegetables from producer to processor, and these commodities are eligible for the normal loading described above.

No student will be held back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but students must actively engage in learning.  All students on track to graduate will do so.  Teachers will teach remotely, assign work, conduct assessments and prepare final report cards.  For students in Grade 12, provincial exams will be cancelled, but teacher assessments will be implemented.  For students in early and middle years, provincial assessments are complete for the current school year, but other assessments will continue.   	“The efforts and success Manitoba teachers and educators have displayed during this public health pandemic have been inspiring,” said Goertzen.  “I join all Manitobans in asking educators to continue doing all they can to use remote and innovative methods to teach students through the remainder of this school year.  Our government is asking for an all-hands-on-deck approach, with their assistance and with that of parents, caregivers, principals, trustees and superintendents for the benefit of all students.”   	Child-care centres located in schools will continue to operate under the current conditions set out by the chief provincial public health officer.  The overall plan is oriented toward the future and we will learn how to modernize education through our response to this situation, Goertzen said.  The combined efforts are geared toward the reopening of classrooms, as well as toward multifaceted ways to teach and to learn after COVID-19, he added.   	The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols, including practising the 3Ps – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.   	- 30 -  BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED   	   "

Liquor delivery and take out orders would be linked to meal orders and offered by licensed establishments whose primary business is food, such as restaurants.  Liquor pricing will be the same as in-dining service menu prices, which will link wine and beer retail to the licensees’ meal service.   	- 30 -  "

The order also repeals previous orders as of 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, April 1 so there is only one public health order in effect at a time.   	“We are seeing what is happening in other jurisdictions, and the time to act is now.  We must continue to adapt to the situation and change our day-to-day lives to prevent unnecessary illness and further tragedies in Manitoba,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer.  “These measures will help us reduce the risk and protect all Manitobans during the ongoing pandemic.”   	The premier noted that a state of emergency declared by the powers set out in Section 10(1) and 10(2) of The Emergency Measures Act to enable the province to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic remains in effect.   	“Manitobans have always pulled together in a time of crisis and this is no different,” said Pallister.  “We must continue to do whatever we can to support each other.”   	The list of public health orders and the schedule of critical services can be found online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19/soe.html.  Businesses with questions about how the order and schedule of critical services apply to their operations can visit http://engagemb.ca/covid19-csp for up-to-date information, and to ask questions that will be answered by government officials.   	- 30 -  BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

After consulting and receiving the support of the Labour Management Review Committee, which includes representatives of both employers and labour organizations, the province is making temporary amendments that would ensure any period of layoff occurring after March 1, 2020, will not be counted toward the period after which a temporary layoff would become a permanent termination.   	“We recognize these unique circumstances may require a longer layoff period than regulation allows, so these amendments would stop the clock until the state of emergency is lifted and keep employers in a position to quickly recall laid-off employees and ramp up business again,” said Fielding.  “We are committed to supporting Manitobans through the COVID-19 pandemic, and we’re taking a balanced approach to help both employers and employees to address economic uncertainty and financial hardship.”   	This measure is temporary and specific to situations where employees will eventually be rehired once the COVID-19 crisis has subsided and economic activity picks up again, said the minister.

Morneau Shepell launched this digital therapy program last week in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. T he new program is guided by professional therapists and addresses anxiety symptoms related to the uniquely challenging aspects of pandemics: uncertainty, physical isolation, caring for family and community members, information overload and stress management.   	“We know many Canadians are struggling with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health,” said Nigel Branker, president, health and productivity solutions at Morneau Shepell.  “With the requirements to self-isolate and practice physical distancing, we are offering a convenient, digital program that can be accessed with any smartphone or tablet.  Our goal is to facilitate access and provide support to as many people as possible across the country.""   	Morneau Shepell’s national network includes thousands of therapists experienced in dealing with the psychological impact of various traumatic events.  Program participants also have access to live crisis counsellors who are available 24-7 if any risk of harm or crisis is identified.   	The program will be available in English and French in the coming weeks at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.   	Pallister noted this is an additional resource to supplement a number of mental health organizations funded by the Manitoba government.  Existing organizations that provide crisis support via phone, text and video conference will continue to provide support through the pandemic.     	Lists of organizations are available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/crisis.html  and www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/addictions/index.html.   	- 30 -  BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED   	   "

This funding will bring added resources for projects and equipment for the crews who will be working on flood protection in areas all across Manitoba, while boosting economic activity during extraordinary global challenges, the minister noted.   	Proposals were reviewed by a panel made up of representatives from the Association of Manitoba Municipalities (AMM), Winnipeg Metropolitan Region and the Manitoba government.  Evaluation of proposals considered factors including flood risk, ability of the proposal to enhance emergency preparedness or resiliency for future flood events, as well as potential regional benefits.   	Based on applications, the breakdown for funding by district is:  	•    Central District – $1,271,662.07 for 14 municipalities;  	•    Eastern District – $776,451.01 for 10 municipalities;  	•    Interlake District – $1,059.167.70 for 10 municipalities;  	•    Midwestern District – $715,082.41 for nine municipalities;  	•    Northern District – $76,899.00 for two municipalities;  	•    Parkland District –  $759,262.68 for 11 municipalities;  	•    Western District – $1,139,583.73 for 15 municipalities; and  	•    Winnipeg Metropolitan Region – $2,041,770.52 for 13 municipalities.   	“The Association of Manitoba Municipalities commends the provincial government for more than doubling its initial commitment to support the Spring Flood Preparedness program,” said Ralph Groening, president of the AMM.  “As municipalities cannot fight floods alone, these additional dollars further help underscore the importance of the provincial-municipal partnership.”   	“The Winnipeg Metropolitan Region commends the Province of Manitoba for providing support through the 2020 Flood Protection Program in such a timely and direct way, as municipalities are on the front lines in flood fighting across this province.  With an important focus on partnerships and projects that cross jurisdictions, this program will ensure resources are used for the maximum benefit of all Manitobans,"" Colleen Sklar, executive director, Winnipeg Metropolitan Region.   	The funding covers a range of items including generators, pumps, steaming equipment to unclog frozen culverts, utility trailers, equipment for emergency operations centres, sandbags and other small equipment that will assist municipalities in protecting vital infrastructure and reducing flood damage.  These items reflect what municipalities have identified as their priority needs in order to prepare for future flood events.   	Also announced today was a new opportunity for municipalities to set aside funding for disaster mitigation programs in their communities while modernizing the Disaster Financial Assistance (DFA) cost-sharing formula.   	“We have developed an optional program for municipalities to apply to set aside funds dedicated to disaster mitigation and increase the resilience of Manitobans against future disasters,” said Squires.  “If approved, municipalities would be able to redirect funds destined for payments under the provincial/municipal DFA cost-sharing formula to disaster mitigation and preparedness measures.”   	“The existing DFA system is a decade old and needs to be revised,” said Schuler.  “As the scale and scope of disasters increases, governments need to shift their focus to mitigation in order to limit the impact of future disasters, rather than relying on response and recovery.”   	If approved, municipalities would be able to redirect funds destined for payments under the provincial/municipal DFA cost-sharing formula to disaster mitigation and preparedness measures.  This would apply when a DFA program qualifies for federal cost sharing under Canada’s Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA).  In this case, the province would reimburse municipalities for 100 per cent of eligible DFA costs.   	Proposed changes to the Disaster Financial Assistance program will result in municipalities covering the first $3.25 per capita, up from $1 per capita, before the DFA formula applies.

Should the current situation deteriorate further and faster than expected, additional funds will have to be borrowed to shore up our health care system.”   	To address this urgent need, the federal government should immediately establish an emergency credit agency to borrow on the provinces’ behalf. The premier noted the federal government can borrow at a much lower rate than the provinces. This would save Canadians billions of dollars annually that could be better spent supporting health-care and the most vulnerable Canadians.   	“Together, we are facing tremendous challenges,” said Pallister. “Now more than ever, Manitobans deserve a health-care system they can be confident in. The choice is clear, stronger banks, or stronger health care.”   	More information can be found at www.manitoba/COVID19.ca.   	- 30 -  "

He also introduced an online portal asking businesses to assist with supplying products and manufacturing what Manitobans need in Manitoba.   	“To help us further our efforts, our government is reaching out to businesses and their employees for products and supplies and those willing to manufacture items from scratch to assist in our efforts in this fight against COVID-19,” Friesen said.  “We recognize that dealing with this pandemic will be a marathon, not a sprint.  Support from Manitoba businesses with additional materials will ensure front-line staff have the equipment they need to protect themselves while continuing to provide exemplary care to patients throughout the province.”   	This initiative will remove barriers allowing Manitoba businesses and manufacturers to redeploy capacity towards the production of essential equipment like ventilators, masks and nasopharyngeal swabs.    	The province has also intensified the search for 10 chest compression systems, which provide additional safety as the equipment removes one staff member from the room.

The Residential Tenancies Branch (RTB) and Residential Tenancies Commission (RTC) will postpone all hearings for non-urgent matters to halt evictions.   	Effective today, all scheduled RTB and RTC hearings will be delayed to protect Manitobans from evictions during the pandemic, with certain exceptions to deal with urgent issues that involve the health and safety of tenants.   	The RTB and the RTC will only issue eviction orders to address issues affecting health and safety including unlawful activities.   	Measures to suspend non-urgent eviction hearings are in place until May 31 and will be monitored to determine if additional adjustments are required.   	“This approach balances the need to support renters experiencing economic hardship or who are self-isolating in their unit due to COVID-19 with those safety concerns,” said Fielding.  “The Residential Tenancies Branch remains available to resolve urgent situations involving health and safety for landlords and tenants, which could include a landlord illegally shutting off utilities or locking tenants out of their rental unit, or a landlord dealing with a situation where a tenant is conducting illegal activities from their rental unit.”   	The RTB offices in Winnipeg and Brandon remain open but all clients must make an appointment first.  The Thompson office is temporarily closed.  Landlords and tenants are encouraged to contact the RTB for information by telephone at 204-945-2476 or toll-free at 1-800-782-8403 and by email at rtb@gov.mb.ca If you are a landlord or tenant and require in-person services, contact the RTB to schedule an appointment.  	   	The RTC remains open, with appropriate social distancing measures in place. The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols, including practising following the 3P’s – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.

The newest probable positive case is a man in his 40s who lives in Winnipeg.  Public health investigation is underway and working to determine if the case is related to travel.  Information about flights where a person with a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 had symptoms at the time of travel are updated as information becomes available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/flights.html.   	Non-essential and routine diagnostic testing, including laboratory, imaging and non-invasive cardiac services, will be postponed as Manitoba continues to respond to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.  Urgent diagnostic testing, including tests and procedures required for immediate care management, will continue with appropriate screening and precautions in place.  Affected patients will be contacted directly and urged to contact their doctor immediately if symptoms worsen.  Appointments will be rescheduled as quickly as possible following response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   	The public is reminded that visitor access at hospitals has been suspended.  Exceptions for compassionate and end-of-life reasons will continue to be made on a case-by-case basis and visitors will be appropriately screened for travel, symptoms and exposure to COVID-19.  For labour and delivery as well as pediatric patients, one visitor continues to be allowed, with the same stringent screening in place.   	Visitor access at long-term care facilities is also subject to significant restrictions, which will now include screening for visitors who have returned from travel outside the province in the last 14 days.  These measures are in place to protect patients, residents and staff.  	   	Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential travel.  This includes international travel and travel within Canada.  There should be no recreational, tourist or non-essential personal travel.  In addition, effective immediately, public health officials are recommending that anyone who returns from travel, either international or domestic, should self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days following their return.   	This recommendation does not include:  	•    the commercial transportation of goods and services;  	•    workers who live in a neighbouring jurisdiction and travel to Manitoba for work;  	•    health care workers who travel to work from outside the province;  	•    normal personal travel in border communities, including visits to a cottage.   	If symptoms develop during the 14-day self-isolation or self-monitoring period, contact Health Links– Info Santé to determine if testing for COVID-19 should be considered.  In cases where testing is not recommended but symptoms are present, stay home (self-isolate) until well.   	Health officials are reminding health-care workers (including physicians, providers and staff) returning from travel they MUST self-identify to their organization/site’s occupational health services.  Health-care workers from organizations that do not have Occupational Health Services can call (toll-free) 1-888-203-4066.   	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.   	A new community testing drive-thru site will officially open Wednesday in Winkler at the Winkler Centennial Arena at 600 Park St.  Hours are daily from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.  When it opens, it will be Manitoba’s 12th community testing site and fourth drive-thru location.  The public is reminded that a referral to these sites is needed and they are not walk-in clinics.  Information on locations and hours of operation are available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

Residents in greatest need, such as the elderly, disabled and those at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during the current global pandemic, will find the application very useful, he noted.   	Built by Manitobans for Manitobans, the provincewide online platform was quickly designed and developed by North Forge Technology Exchange, a non-profit and team-led Winnipeg technology organization, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  North Forge collaborated with others in the community, resulting in development of the app – the first online service of its kind in Canada – within five days.   	“There are a lot of amazing people out there creating volunteer platforms, but we wanted to ensure that security and safety are embedded to protect our citizens”, Joelle Foster, CEO, North Forge Technology Exchange. “As such, we turned to our community of innovators and we are so pleased that software development partners like Permission Click and ID Fusion Software stepped up to collaborate with us and have built this tool in record time.""   	The online tool www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca will be vital for requests ranging from home computer and data security assistance to prescription medication pickups and deliveries.  Manitobans can access www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca directly or via www.Manitoba.ca/COVID19.   	“This is how Manitobans pull together, put their heads together and bring ideas to life to assist each other when help is needed,” said Pallister.  “Manitoba has been the home of hope for over 150 years, and we will continue to be the home of hope for generations to come.  We will get through this pandemic together.   	The premier added the province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols, including practising following the 3P’s – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.   	- 30 -  "

Research Manitoba is working with the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) to invest in the Canadian 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Rapid Research Funding Opportunity.  The Manitoba government is investing $800,000 and the CIHR is investing more than $465,000 in three research projects including:  	•    investigating how logistical systems can adapt to a pandemic at the University of Manitoba;  	•    developing a cost-effective, point-of-need diagnostic test for COVID-19 at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health; and  	•    developing a COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Manitoba.   	In an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and keep in-home health-care providers and our communities safe, new screening steps will be undertaken in advance of home and community visits.  Health-care providers are contacting clients to complete screening in advance of normal appointments.  Wherever possible, this screening will occur over the phone but may also be conducted from an appropriate social distance (two metres or six feet) before entry to the home.  Screening is intended to identify potential for exposure to COVID-19 within the household, and identify whether services may safely be postponed or offered in another way such as over the phone.   	For visits that must occur in person as scheduled, providers will use appropriate personal protective equipment and follow proper hand hygiene protocols.   	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

The $2-million fund will be administered by The Winnipeg Foundation and will provide grants to child-care providers with 16 or fewer children and to home-based providers with 12 or fewer children.  The grants can be used to purchase supplies for meeting health and safety requirements, such as a fire extinguisher or first aid kits, or to undertake minor upgrades to physical spaces or to provide quality learning and care items such as high chairs, mats or books.   	Further information on all of these programs will be provided online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.  	   	The Manitoba government recommends that all parents continue to try to make their own alternate arrangements for child care.  These interim options should be used only when parents cannot make other child-care plans.  Parents who use these options will continue to pay daily parent fees.   	Child-care centres are expected to reimburse or offer credits on parent fees that have been collected for dates when care will no longer be offered.  Unless care is being provided, parent fees should no longer be charged as of April 1.   	Essential, front-line workers who need child-care options should call 204-945-0776 or (toll-free) 1-888-213-4754, or e-mail cdcinfo@gov.mb.ca.  All questions about the new funding programs available to child-care centres and early childhood educators should be sent to ecegrant@gov.mb.ca.

Surgery programs across Manitoba will begin suspending elective (non-urgent) surgical procedures starting Monday, March 23.  This will help ensure staff, beds, equipment and supplies remain available and flexible for COVID-19 response.   	Hospitals across the province will continue with scheduled surgeries for cancer, trauma and other surgeries that cannot be delayed.  Time-sensitive orthopedic, obstetrical, gynecology and ophthalmology surgeries will also continue.a  Surgery slates will be examined to ensure proper patient care continues and any affected patients will be contacted about changes to their care.   	Prescription renewals will now be limited to a 30-day supply.  In times where supplies of some medication may be limited, this strategy is designed to ensure people do not stockpile medicine and all patients have access to their medication.   	For the next four weeks, CancerCare Manitoba will consolidate two cancer clinics to offer services out of one location.  Cancer clinic services currently offered at Seven Oaks General Hospital will now be delivered out of the Victoria General Hospital Cancer Clinic and affected patients will be contacted by their clinical team.  Visits that can be completed virtually or by phone will continue to be managed in that way and patients requiring treatment will be seen at CancerCare Manitoba’s various cancer clinics.   	As demand increases, additional resources continue to be added to Health Links–Info Santé.  More phone lines have been added and additional staff have been deployed to assist with the higher call volume.  Work is nearly complete and an interactive voice recording (IVR) will launch soon to prescreen callers before they speak to a clinician.   	A new community testing site opened in Steinbach this morning.  Located at 365 Reimer Ave., the site will operate as a drive-thru, with daily hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.  These locations are not walk-in clinics.  Patients must receive a referral prior to arriving at these sites.  Other locations throughout the province include:  	•    Winnipeg – Access Winnipeg West (280 Booth Dr.), Access Fort Garry (135 Plaza Dr.), Access Transcona (845 Regent Ave. West) and the Mount Carmel Clinic (886 Main St.).  Hours are 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. during the week and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.  	•    Brandon – The Nurses Residence Gymnasium at the Brandon Regional Health Centre  	(150 McTavish Ave. East).  Hours are daily from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.  	•    Selkirk –  622 Superior Ave.  The drive-thru site will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  	•    Thompson – Thompson Clinic in the Plaza Mall (50 Selkirk Ave.).  Hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday to Friday.  	•    The Pas – Guy Hall, 28 First St. West.

The budget supplement outlined key measures that contribute to Manitoba’s resiliency:  	•    reinvestment in the rainy day fund – over the coming month, the province will increase the Fiscal Stabilization Fund to $800 million from $571 million, and transfer an additional $72 million by the end of the 2020-21 fiscal year;  	•    prudent budgeting – the province has avoided $10 billion in debt over the past four years as a result of responsible financial decisions, as well as approximately $200 million of incremental interest costs;  	•    federal support – $18 million in federal support is available to Manitoba and Ottawa has indicated further aid is likely forthcoming; and  	•    a stable, resilient economy – with Manitoba’s diversified economic base, the province continues to have one of the most competitive and stable economies in Canada.     	Overall, Manitoba has nearly $1 billion of financial flexibility to address this challenge, if required, the minister noted.   	“The steps our government has taken over the past four years to manage provincial finances more responsibly means that we are better positioned to respond to this and future emergencies and withstand the ongoing period of economic uncertainty,” said Fielding.  “Living in a province that regularly faces floods and other natural disasters has taught us the importance of being prepared for emergencies and having flexibility and agility in our planning and response.”   	Fielding noted the province is making the necessary investments to address the pandemic and implementing protocols to ensure funds are available in order to quickly respond to the rapidly changing situation.   	The COVID-19 response will also impact Manitoba’s forecasted budgetary revenues for the 2020-21 fiscal year, the minister said.  Preliminary estimates for Manitoba’s economy suggest a large initial decline in economic growth during the first half of 2020, followed by a recovery in the second half of the year.  Growth in 2021 may be higher than currently forecast as a result of the return of pent-up demand across impacted sectors, he noted.  The Budget 2020 supplement states that there are reasons to believe Manitoba will see a less significant decline than other jurisdictions, in part, given the province’s diversified economic base.   	The government’s 2019-20 third quarter fiscal update released in early March projected a $325-million deficit for the current fiscal year.  The province does not anticipate significant impacts that would disrupt that forecast.   	The Manitoba government will update its projections as the situation unfolds over the coming months.  Government departments continue to engage closely with key provincial stakeholders and other governments to mitigate the economic and public health challenges of this significant event, Fielding said.

The PST reduction is expected to create an average annual savings of approximately $345 per household, with approximately 510,000 households in Manitoba.  Combined with an additional $131 in savings estimated to be passed along by Manitoba businesses, it results in total average savings of $476 per year to Manitoba households.   	The province will replenish the rainy day fund and will contribute an additional $300 million to the fund by the end of 2020-21.  This will result in a balance of $872 million, at which point the rainy day fund will be fully funded.   	“Our province will be in a far stronger position to respond to unforeseen emergencies and we have never been as prepared to deal with those situations,” said Fielding.  “While the previous government left Manitoba without the resources to respond to natural disasters, our government is replenishing the rainy day fund.”   	Additionally, the emergency expenditures contingency is increased to $100 million, which is effectively $86 million higher than it was in 2016, and an incremental $45 million available for infrastructure projects aimed at improving environmental resiliency.  The government is determined to complete the Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin Outlet Channels Project as soon as possible and Budget 2020 allocates a total of $101 million for the important flood mitigation initiative.   	The expected provincial deficit for Budget 2020 has been reduced to $220 million, an improvement of $140 million over the previous year.  Fielding also reconfirmed the government is on track to balance the budget within its current term.  Importantly, the province is also forecasting that its debt-to-GDP ratios will be declining over the next four years, which is a significant signal of improving fiscal health, the minister noted.   	“Supported by strong revenue growth and responsible expenditure controls, we are now one step closer to delivering a balanced budget during the current term of government,” said Fielding.  “We have modestly exceeded our plans each year and we are predicting, for the fourth year in a row, an improvement to our earlier forecasts.  We have reduced the deficit each year, while making record investments in health, in education and for families.  We have made life more affordable for Manitobans by cutting the retail sales tax rate, by ending income tax bracket creep and by eliminating many other fees.”   	Budget 2020 provides record investments in health care at $6.8 billion and education with $1.3 billion in operating grants to public school divisions.  The Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living budget includes funding for a range of capital projects, such as the Health Sciences Centre master campus plan and St. Boniface Hospital redevelopment, with a total strategic infrastructure budget of $1.8 billion.  A $160-million investment on capital projects in the kindergarten to Grade 12 education system will result in 4,425 new classroom spaces either open or under construction by the end of the 2020-21 fiscal year as the government builds seven new schools and several major additions and renovation projects.   	The budget commits to keeping Manitobans safe in their homes and communities, and strengthens provincial plans to work with communities and law enforcement to prevent crime.

Public health investigations are continuing on the two additional positive cases identified yesterday.  It appears that both cases are related to travel.   	In an effort to protect patients, staff and the community, all Manitoba health-care facilities will soon begin implementing enhanced precautions and protocols which will involve additional visitor restrictions.  Exceptions for compassionate reasons will continue to be made on a case-by-case basis.   	This step follows public health’s recommendation earlier this week to suspend visitor access to long-term-care facilities across the province.  Similar to health-care facilities, exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of individual facility managers.   	Preparations continue to ensure acute care facilities are prepared in the event of COVID-19 patients requiring admissions.  Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg (HSC) has begun a series of moves as part of the provincially co-ordinated response.  A medicine unit will today be relocated to existing clinical space in the former HSC Women’s Pavilion at 735 Notre Dame Ave. to enable the movement of patients within the hospital campus to create a 30-bed isolation unit.   	Twenty-seven additional ventilators, which are crucial to caring for critically ill patients, have arrived and will be put into operation at health-care facilities throughout the province.  This brings Manitoba’s overall supply to 266.  It is anticipated an additional 16 ventilators, also ordered last week, will be delivered in the coming weeks.   	Agencies that offer day programs through Community Living disABILITY Services for adults with intellectual disabilities have been asked to limit this service as part of the effort to support social distancing efforts and reduce the potential spread of the virus.  As soon as possible, day services will only be offered to individuals who:  	•    live with family members who could lose their job if day services are not provided,  	•    are supported by home share providers who can’t provide care during daytime hours and where other arrangements are not possible, and  	•    cannot be safely supported in their residence during daytime hours.

Case eight is a man in his 80s who lives in Winnipeg.  Patient contact and public health investigations are ongoing.   	Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential international travel.  They are also recommending all international travellers self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after returning to Canada.   	Work is underway to finalize guidelines for health-care and critical infrastructure workers who return from international travel to address any impacts on essential services.  All physicians, health-care providers and support staff returning from international travel MUST self-identify to their organization or site’s occupational health services.   	Manitoba patients are advised their surgery may be postponed if their surgeon has determined their procedure can be safely delayed for three months or longer without any significant effects on their health.  The goal is to protect patients who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.  Patients that will be affected by cancellations will include:  	•    patients older than 70 years of age;  	•    patients with significant underlying health conditions; and  	•    patients who are immune compromised.   	Patients will be contacted directly to confirm that their surgery is being affected.   	CancerCare Manitoba advises that patients with symptoms of a respiratory illness should not visit their sites.  Instead, patients with symptoms should call their health-care team and follow their instructions on next steps.  Cancer patients should check the website www.cancercare.mb.ca for regular updates to cancer patient information.   	Manitobans are reminded that certain individuals should NOT visit acute care or long term care facilities.  This includes those who have:  	•    returned from international travel in the last 14 days;  	•    been instructed to self-isolate for 14 days; or  	•    have cold or flu-like symptoms, such as a cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat, weakness or headache.

Given the evolving COVID-19 situation, the health system is now implementing elevated precautions to protect patients, as many have underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk of becoming severely ill due to COVID-19.  Certain individuals should NOT visit acute care or long-term care facilities.  This includes those who have:  	•    returned from international travel in the last 14 days;  	•    been instructed to self-isolate for 14 days; or  	•    have cold or flu-like symptoms, such as a cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat, weakness or headache.

In addition, Manitoba and Doctors Manitoba have agreed on new payment options to offer virtual visit and virtual care psychotherapy options to supplement traditional models of care including video-conferencing options.  Physicians will work with their patients to use these options.   	Transportation industry partners needs to ensure all companies are made aware of important considerations with respect to essential cross-border crossings.  At this time, public health officials are not mandating drivers to self-isolate after crossing the border to ensure essential services continue.   	However, all companies should make sure drivers are not showing respiratory symptoms before crossing the border and take the necessary measures if they exhibit COVID-19 symptoms.  This includes calling Health-Links Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 to speak to a health practitioner and requesting the affected driver to self-isolate until they are assessed.   	Manitoba’s adult and youth correctional facilities continue to allow visitors, with restrictions in place to protect the health and safety of people in custody as well as staff.  Visits from family members will continue to be allowed but with no contact.  Visits with legal counsel will continue with no changes.  All centres have suspended all visits from volunteers and community agencies until further notice.   	There have been reports of multiple phishing scams related to COVID-19.  Many are asking people for credit card information to provide medication following a positive test results.  This is not a call that Manitobans would receive from public health officials.  Manitobans are advised to not provide any financial data, hang up on the call and to report to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at (toll-free) 1-888-495-8501.

Health Links received more than 1,000 calls yesterday.  Staffing numbers continue to be increased and technical enhancements are being worked on including an online self-assessment tool that will help Manitobans identify whether they need to be tested for the virus.  It is anticipated this tool will be available in the next few days.   	HSC Winnipeg is restricting the number of public entrances to the campus beginning today, so visitors can be properly screened for COVID-19 upon arrival.  These restrictions will protect patients who may have underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk of severe illness due to COVID-19.  Patients are now only allowed one visitor at a time.  Exceptions will be made at a manager’s discretion for special circumstances, such as visitors who require an escort or those going to see a patient nearing the end of their life.   	Similar measures are being considered for other health-care facilities throughout the province and at long-term care homes.   	Visitors arriving at facilities throughout Manitoba’s health system can expect to be screened upon arrival for COVID-19.  If visitors are ill or have travelled internationally in the past 14 days, or if they have been instructed to self-monitor or self-isolate, they are strongly encouraged to stay home for the well-being of staff, volunteers, patients and the general public.   	CancerCare Manitoba is asking patients with upcoming appointments or tests to call ahead.  Cancer patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19 due to weakened immune systems, so appointments and tests may be rescheduled if not considered urgent or patients are not actively being treated for the disease.   	Similarly, patients living with kidney disease are also at higher risk of infection.  Scheduled dialysis treatments are proceeding as usual for patients who are well.  However, dialysis patients experiencing cold- or flu-like symptoms who have returned from international travel in the past 14 days are asked to call Health Links-Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 for an initial assessment.  They are also asked to call their renal unit before leaving home for a dialysis treatment or clinic visit so staff can prepare to treat them in a way that keeps them and others from possibly being exposed to COVID-19.   	In keeping with social distancing strategies outlined to Manitobans and in consultation with key stakeholders, public health officials have advised suspending classes in Manitoba kindergarten to Grade 12 schools effective March 23 to April 10.  This is being done to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Manitoba.   	Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:  	•    ensure ill staff and students stay home from school, and support those who are self-isolating at home to ensure they do not fall behind in their studies;  	•    reduce activities in large groups and crowds;  	•    increase desk distance between students; and  	•    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms to reduce the number of people in classrooms and increase distance between staff and students.   	Public health officials continue to recommend social distancing measures for all Manitobans including:  	•    cancelling or postponing any large-scale events (events with more than 250 attendees);  	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;  	•    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;  	•    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;  	•    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill with the virus; and  	•    avoiding all non-essential travel, as well as crowded places and events.   	Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps to ensure employees can stay home when ill, without facing barriers such as the requirement for sick notes, and work from home if possible.  Employers should also discontinue non-essential, work-related travel outside of Manitoba and encourage virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, close contact between individuals.   	People are encouraged to take common prevention measures including regular handwashing with soap and warm water for at least 15 seconds.  Make sure to dry hands thoroughly.  Alternatively, people can use an alcohol-based hand cleanser if their hands are not visibly dirty.  People should also cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or cough or sneeze into their sleeve.   	Being prepared also means using official sources for the most up-to-date and accurate information.  The Manitoba government is also urging media to exercise caution in reporting information related to the evolving COVID-19 situation and to avoid hearsay or speculation, as this can spread misinformation.

Public health officials continue to recommend social distancing measures for all Manitobans including:  	•    cancelling or postponing any large-scale events (events with more than 250 attendees);  	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;  	•    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;  	•    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;  	•    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill with the virus; and  	•    avoiding all non-essential travel, as well as crowded places and events.   	Health-care providers are strongly discouraging the public from visiting any health-care facility, including long-term care facilities, if they have:  	•    returned from international travel in the past 14 days;  	•    been directed to self-monitor or self-isolate for 14 days; or  	•    are experiencing cold and flu symptoms, such as a cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat, headache or weakness.   	Visitors arriving at health-care facilities may also be asked direct questions about their symptoms, contacts and travel history upon arrival.  This includes HSC Winnipeg, which will begin restricting access points to the campus on Sunday to ensure proper screening of visitors arriving at the facility can occur.   	Traffic at the four community screening locations in Winnipeg continues.  These locations include Access sites in Fort Garry, Winnipeg West and Transcona, as well as the Mount Carmel Clinic.  All sites are open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. this weekend, and 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  Patients should be referred for testing to attend to the community screening locations.  Walk-in traffic without a referral is discouraged.   	Additionally, HSC Winnipeg has also opened a testing clinic for low-acuity patients in its William Avenue mall, where patients can be tested for both COVID-19 and influenza.   	Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps to ensure employees can stay home when ill, without facing barriers such as the requirement for sick notes, and work from home if possible.  Employers should also discontinue non-essential, work-related travel outside of Manitoba and encourage virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, close contact between individuals.   	People are encouraged to take common prevention measures including regular handwashing with soap and warm water for at least 15 seconds.  Make sure to dry hands thoroughly.  Alternatively, people can use an alcohol-based hand cleanser if their hands are not visibly dirty.  People should also cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or cough or sneeze into their sleeve.   	Being prepared also means using official sources for the most up-to-date and accurate information.  The Manitoba government is also urging media to exercise caution in reporting information related to the evolving COVID-19 situation and to avoid hearsay or speculation, as this can spread misinformation.

The administrative tribunal jurisdiction act would allow government to determine which have the authority to hear constitutional and charter issues, recognizing these decisions require specialized expertise.     	“Administrative tribunals are important decision-making bodies, responsible for a broad range of issues that affect Manitobans’ lives,” said Cullen.  “However, it is inefficient and impractical for all of them to make decisions on complex constitutional matters.  This legislation would allow government to clarify roles, ensuring all administrative tribunals can provide more timely decisions for Manitobans in their areas of expertise.”   	There are dozens of administrative tribunals in Manitoba, responsible for making decisions on a broad range of matters.  This includes the Residential Tenancies Commission, which hears disputes between landlords and tenants; the Automobile Injury Compensation Appeal Commission, which hears complaints about payments for bodily injuries paid by Manitoba Public Insurance; and the Judicial Council, which hears charges of misconduct involving provincial court judges.   	The minister noted it would be inefficient for all tribunals to hear constitutional issues, as the need to access external legal expertise or provide members with the necessary legal background could add significant delays and costs.     	Following a legal review and analysis, the province would determine which administrative tribunals would have jurisdiction to decide questions of constitutional law and formalize this approach in regulation.  Alberta and British Columbia have similar legislation in place to clarify which tribunals can hear constitutional issues.   	The second piece of legislation introduced today is The Human Rights Code Amendment Act.  It builds on an independent review of the Manitoba Human Rights Commission and the Manitoba Human Rights Adjudication Panel and its recommendations to address complaints in a more timely and efficient manner.   	The amendments would empower the commission to make decisions sooner by allowing the commission’s executive director to dismiss complaints, including those outside its jurisdiction, and to decline to investigate complaints that are being adequately addressed in another forum.  The process for adjudication would be improved by giving adjudicators the authority to mediate complaints and setting time limits to ensure the adjudicators’ hearings and decisions are timely.   	The changes would also set the maximum financial award for injury to dignity, feelings or self-respect stemming from a human rights complaint at $25,000.  There would continue to be no cap on other compensation dealing with lost wages, income or benefits and existing caps on financial penalties related to malicious or reckless actions remain in place.   	“Our government is taking steps to respond to the independent review of the commission and adjudication panel,” said Cullen. “In the past, it has sometimes taken years for a human rights complaint to come to a conclusion.  These amendments will help ensure Manitobans who file a human rights complaint can be confident their matter will be handled in a fair and timely way.”     	The independent review of the Manitoba Human Rights Commission and the Manitoba Human Rights Adjudication Panel is available at www.manitoba.ca/openmb/infomb/departments.html under Manitoba Justice.   	- 30 -  "

As of Jan. 1, 2021, Manitoba will increase the following payroll tax thresholds:  	•    employers with an annual payroll of $1.5 million or less will be exempt (up from the current $1.25 million exemption threshold);  	•    employers with an annual payroll between $1.5 million and $3 million will pay 4.3 per cent on the amount within this range (up from the current range of $1.25 million to $2.5 million); and  	•    employers with an annual payroll above $3 million will pay 2.15 per cent of the total payroll (up from the current $2.5 million threshold).   	The increased thresholds are expected to benefit approximately 1,000 employers in Manitoba, and make approximately 220 employers exempt from paying the tax altogether.   	“We have heard from Manitoba business owners and operators that one of the key factors affecting business growth is the tax burden, in particular payroll taxes that affect business growth the most,” said Fielding.  “We are addressing this concern with these changes to make Manitoba an even more attractive place to do business.”   	Manitoba’s payroll tax thresholds have not changed since 2008.   	“Initiatives like this one from the Manitoba government have meaningful impact on businesses like ours,” said Jamie Kozak, Principal Architect at Prairie Architects Inc., a business that will become exempt from paying the tax next year.  “Raising the payroll tax exemption to $1.5 million allows our company to reinvest approximately $5,000 back into our business operations every year.”   	Prairie Architects Inc. is leading the Fort Richmond Collegiate New Life Skills Suite and Band Room Addition and Renovations project, into which the provincial government is investing $1 million.  Fielding visited the work site today to present a new pair of steel-toed work boots to Jaycek Valentine, a junior apprentice on the project.   	This is the fifth year in a row where the Manitoba government carried on its tradition of presenting a new pair of shoes to a deserving Manitoban, rather than the finance minister purchasing himself new shoes to wear on budget day.   	“These work boots symbolize one of our government’s priorities – to create more jobs for Manitobans and drive economic growth,” said Fielding.  “Our Economic Growth Action Plan is growing optimism throughout the province and we are working to create 40,000 new jobs during the current term of government.  We know we are on the right path, as approximately 9,700 more Manitobans were working in the first two months of 2020.”   	Fielding will present Budget 2020 tomorrow afternoon in the Manitoba legislature.   	- 30 -  "

Current inventory of PPE supplies is being closely monitored, and regions and sites have been asked to take steps to ensure supplies of PPE, including procedure/surgical masks and N95 respirators, are maintained and that providers and staff are aware of their appropriate clinical use.   	The purchase will help to ensure patients, staff, and front-line health workers, have appropriate protective equipment at a competitive price.  The determination of the volume of supplies needed is undertaken collaboratively with the assistance of the Public Health Agency of Canada.  Most personal protective equipment used in clinical environments will not spoil.   	Based on current planning assumptions, including supplies required by Manitoba’s regional health authorities, service delivery organizations, personal care homes and fee-for-service clinics, the projected cost is an estimated $35.2 million.   	PPE supplies are being utilized as health-care facilities and sites across the province in line with clinical recommendations.  This includes use by staff of gloves, gowns, procedure or surgical masks and face/eye protection when dealing with any patients who have flu-like symptoms (cough, fever, difficulty breathing).  Procedure or surgical masks are also provided to patients who show these symptoms, as well as anyone accompanying them.     	Staff performing certain procedures are required to wear an N95 respirator in addition to eye-protection, gloves and a gown.  Efforts to ensure staff are appropriately trained and fit-tested for the N95 are underway across the province.   	“The government and public health officials are reminding Manitobans the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in Manitoba remains low, but is increasing given events occurring in Canada and around the world.  We must continue to prepare for this virus in Manitoba,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief public health officer.   	The Manitoba government is working with Shared Health, Manitoba’s regional health authorities and service delivery organizations as well as the Public Health Agency of Canada to share information and best practices.   	Common personal prevention and preparedness measures for viruses such as COVID-19 and influenza include regular hand washing with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and staying home when you are sick, regardless of recent travel.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.

MARTIN OUTLET CHANNELS PROJECT REACHES MILESTONE    	The Lake Manitoba Lake St. Martin Outlet Channels project has advanced to the next phase of the assessment process, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.   	“Completing this crucial climate-change adaptation project – a project that will provide certainty for many communities and families – is one of our government’s top priorities and I am proud of the work we have done to reach this stage,” said Schuler.  “We are pleased to share the Environmental Impact Statement for public comment and we are eager to begin the next phase of the environmental assessment process, which is the technical review.”   	In 2011, Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin reached record high water levels.  The province has committed to building two permanent outlet channels to alleviate flooding in that part of the Interlake region.   	“We have worked hard to achieve progress on this project, spent more than $50 million in consultation and preliminary engineering, design and preparation work,” said Schuler.  “We are very pleased the federal government is committed to working together, and that we’re finally achieving progress on project timelines, while being respectful to all concerned.”   	Before construction begins, the project requires federal and provincial regulatory approvals.  Both governments will continue to engage in Crown-Indigenous consultations with all potentially impacted communities, and the province is in the process of signing consultation agreements with Indigenous communities.   	During the next stage, set to begin immediately, the federal and provincial governments will be seeking feedback from subject matter experts, the public and Indigenous communities through the public registries to address further concerns and clarification.   	“Jointly with our partners in the federal government, we will be investing resources to ensure meaningful consultation and co-ordination with Indigenous communities and other stakeholders,” said Schuler.  “We are confident in the merits of the project and look forward to any feedback the federal government, Indigenous groups and communities, and stakeholders will provide.”   	To date, the province has engaged with 39 Indigenous communities and groups identified by provincial and federal requirements, and is in the process of signing consultation agreements with 10 First Nation communities that will be impacted by the project.   	Increasing frequency of severe weather and flood events creates an even more pressing need to put safeguards in place to protect communities and families, the minister said.  Projects like these and other adaptation infrastructure, will help give communities and families their lives back while setting Manitoba on a course for greater security and economic certainty, he added.

Users would be able to go online, create a customer profile, select the desired product or licence, and check out as they would with any other online purchase.  There will also be an option to purchase licences and permits online at Manitoba Conservation and Climate offices around the province and at participating retailers.  A digital copy of the licence would be available to download from the customer’s account and a copy must be printed out and carried while hunting or fishing so it can be presented upon request.  Park vehicle permits would also have to be printed for display on the vehicle’s dashboard.   	“The Manitoba Wildlife Federation has been advocating to have e-licensing brought to the province for years,” said Chris Heald, executive director, Manitoba Wildlife Federation.  “We appreciate the work that has gone into this project and are glad to see the province has listened to the voice of hunters, anglers and trappers.  We look forward to having access to the added convenience this system allows.”   	Benefits of using an e-licensing approach would include:  	•    access 24 hours a day, seven days a week online or by telephone;     	•    access through participating retailers (list will be available online);  	•    the ability to immediately purchase and print licenses and permits at home;  	•    receiving email confirmation of licences/permits purchased; and  	•    improved data collection that will support program management.  	   	“With expanded access such as the ability to make purchases from a smartphone or mobile device, we are using technology to move Manitoba forward,” said Pedersen.  “As Manitobans embrace the new system, we will roll out additional licences and permits for purchase online and continue taking steps to improve our services.”   	This initiative is a priority as identified in the ministers’ mandate letter, and supports the government’s commitment to enhance public services, reduce red tape and advance innovative technology solutions.   	In addition to current base licence fees, an administration fee of $4.50 will be included in all licences and permit purchases to support enhanced service delivery, with the exception of the Manitoba Resident Seniors Conservation Angling Licences that will remain free of charge.

The proposed legislation would create a framework where:  	•    the Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba (DGCM) will become the primary regulator of Credit Union Central of Manitoba, in addition to its current role as primary regulator of Manitoba’s credit unions and caisses populaires;  	•    the Financial Institutions Regulation Branch of the Manitoba Financial Services Agency (Registrar) will oversee the Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba to ensure it fulfils its regulatory role and maintain responsibility for the system itself; and  	•    the Manitoba government continues to be responsible for the Manitoba Financial Services Agency.   	The minister noted the changes would ensure Manitoba’s regulatory framework meets national and international standards for the effective oversight of deposit-taking institutions, which includes monitoring solvency, liquidity, and safety and soundness.   	As of Dec. 31, 2019, there were 25 credit unions and one caisse populaire in Manitoba, with 199 branch locations and a presence in 124 Manitoba communities.  The sector’s assets were approximately $34.5 billion.  The Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba provides protection for deposits held with these institutions.   	The minister noted the Manitoba government developed the proposed legislative changes after reviewing other jurisdictions and best practices, and the new framework would resemble the SaskCentral model.   	- 30 -  "

Both the made-in-Manitoba Green Levy and the PST reduction will come into effect on July 1.   	“Unfortunately, the federal government ignored our request to work together as a true partner in tackling climate change, so we have no choice but to act now to protect Manitobans from the rising federal government carbon tax they are bringing in this year,” said Pallister.  “Ottawa has provided special exceptions and exemptions to many other provinces but refused to consider Manitoba’s significant clean hydro investments.”   	Manitobans will come out ahead with both the flat Green Levy and lower PST.  The average Manitoba household will save $200 in 2022 through Manitoba’s flat Green Levy alone, adding up to more than $700 over the next five years, the premier said.   	The premier noted that 100 per cent of the flat Manitoba Green Levy will be returned to Manitobans.  Dropping the PST to six per cent will save Manitobans $325 million each year, $40 million more than the actual cost of the flat Manitoba carbon levy.  The average Manitoba household will save $359 in 2022 with a six per cent PST.   	“Unlike the federal government’s rising carbon tax, our flat made-in-Manitoba Green Levy will return all of the money and more to Manitobans with the second-lowest PST in Canada,” said Pallister.   	Manitoba large industrial emitters will reduce emissions through a made-in-Manitoba output-based carbon pricing system based on the flat Green Levy of $25 per tonne.   	Greenhouse-gas emissions in Manitoba will be reduced by at least two megatonnes (MT) over the five-year carbon savings account period set in legislation, a doubling of the original one MT goal fixed last June.   	“Manitobans know tackling climate change is important and we are already doing our part by investing billions in clean, green hydro,” said Pallister.  “Together with the our hydro investments, the highest clean fuel standards in the country announced in January, plus additional measures we are taking, Manitoba’s carbon emissions will be reduced by more than any previous government.  Our plan is better for the environment, better for the economy, and better for children and grandchildren.”   	Manitoba is taking strong action on climate change and implementing a flat Green Levy to replace the federal backstop carbon tax, Pallister added.   	“Manitoba has offered to be a bridge between east and west on climate and carbon and that offer still stands,” said Pallister.  “Working with us should not be a bridge too far for the federal government.”   	- 30 -  "

Before the province can authorize testing, it would develop regulations and a permitting system this year, in consultation with stakeholders, the minister noted.   	“By enabling developers to safely test emerging vehicle technologies on provincial roadways, we are supporting Manitoba’s large agricultural, trucking, heavy vehicle manufacturing and technology development sectors,” said Schuler.  “Numerous vehicle technologies are in development and ready for testing, creating opportunities for Manitoba-based business.”   	The bill also amends The Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) Corporation Act and The Insurance Act concerning registration and insurance requirements for vehicle testing organizations.   	- 30 -  	   "

Budget 2020 will allocate $600,000 in Manitoba Infrastructure revenue and expenditure to reflect the collected permit fees from companies and the corresponding expense to maintain provincial highways that are included in the program.     	To clear the outstanding balance in the Trucking Productivity Improvement Fund, Manitoba Infrastructure will make a one-time, $5-million investment in road preservation and maintenance in 2020-21.

Revenue is up $248 million compared to budget projections, mainly related to an increase in income taxes.  Expenses are also up $118 million compared to budget projections, as the forecast includes over $150 million for new green initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in debt-servicing costs.   	Fielding noted the report proves the province is delivering on the infrastructure promises made as part of Budget 2019, which committed at least $1 billion in strategic infrastructure spending on priorities such as roads and bridges, flood protection, hospitals, schools, universities and colleges.  The third quarter report forecasts $1,227 million on infrastructure spending.   	The minister noted the province continues to ensure value for money on procurement and has centralized many capital delivery functions to create efficiencies.     	Manitobans can view the third quarter financial report online at www.gov.mb.ca/finance/publications/financialreports.html.    	- 30 -  "

The minister noted the goal of Restorative Justice North is to increase the use of diversion options in Thompson. Accordingly, MKO will also develop a complementary restorative justice program for Thompson, based on their existing expertise in restorative justice.   	“MKO is hopeful that this announcement and initial investments are the beginning of utilizing culturally appropriate and Indigenous ways of being to address justice issues in the north,” said Grand Chief Garrison Settee, MKO.  “Criminal offences stem from systemic causes that require more in-depth and holistic approaches that focuses on the victim, offender and the community at large.  Without holistic approaches to address justice, the cycle continues without any benefit to the community.  Restorative justice is a step forward in addressing the impacts of colonialism.  The approach must be Indigenous led with First Nations, Inuit and Métis at the table and inputting into the design, having decision making authority and implementing from a culturally appropriate lens.”   	The Manitoba government is investing more than $2.8 million in restorative justice programs this year, an increase of $400,000 over the previous fiscal year.  This increase includes additional investments of $50,000 with both MMF and MKO.     	The minister noted he looks forward to ongoing collaboration with the City of Thompson, MKO, MMF and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC) on these important issues.     	“On behalf of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, I congratulate all parties involved in the restorative justice and safety pilot project for the City of Thompson,” said Grand Chief Arlen Dumas, AMC.  “The AMC supports any Manitoba Justice initiative intended to reduce the incarceration rates of our citizens in the Thompson area and elsewhere.  It is my hope that restorative justice grounded in First Nations principles will also help to reduce recidivism, support offenders, and offer alternatives, particularly for the First Nations youth in the Thompson area.”   	Every year, more than 5,000 matters are diverted out of the criminal justice system to be resolved through restorative justice and diversion programs.  Restorative justice and diversion programs have proved beneficial for addressing systemic roots causes that lead to criminal activity and create an opportunity for the offender to make amends to the victim and the community, and help reduce the likelihood of future contact with the legal system.  Individuals who participate before charges are laid can avoid the stigma of a criminal charge.   	The minister noted funding allocated for the City of Thompson’s strategy builds on $300,000 previously allocated by the province to support community safety initiatives.  This commitment was set out in the May 2019 Policing and Public Safety Strategy.  For more information, visit: www.gov.mb.ca/justice/pubs/police_publicsafety_strategy.pdf.     	For more information on Manitoba’s Criminal Justice Modernization Strategy, visit: www.gov.mb.ca/justice/cjsm/index.html.

Schuler noted the province has invested approximately $65 million in flood mitigation measures through the Red River Valley over the past four years.  Projects include:  	•    raising northbound lanes of PTH 75 south of Morris and improving drainage (construction underway);  	•    reconstructing the Plum River bridge in the northbound lanes of PTH 75 near St. Jean Baptiste;  	•    reconstructing the Marsh River bridge on PTH 23 east of Morris; and  	•    reconstructing the Little Morris River bridge on PR 422 near Rosenfeld.     	The Hydrologic Forecast Centre plans to release a second Spring Thaw Outlook in late March.  At that time, forecasters will have a more focused assessment of the Red River and will update the forecast based on the most current conditions at that time.   	The Red River in Manitoba is affected by flows from North Dakota and water from the Manitoba portion of the basin.  The river widens as it moves north, naturally flattens and lowers its peak as it moves downstream.

Upgrades to the interpretive centre will be guided by a comprehensive plan that re-imagines the space.  Renovations and enhancements will focus on creatively and strategically highlighting the natural surroundings while leveraging innovative and interactive educational tools.    	“The opportunity to enhance our space and visitor experience is exciting,” says Karla Guyn, CEO for Ducks Unlimited Canada.  “Since the interpretive centre was built more than 25 years ago, it has provided students and visitors with unique ways to learn about the natural world.  We look forward to finding new ways of connecting people with wetlands within an updated facility.”   	Open year-round, the interpretive centre is used by school groups and tourists and offers a variety of guided programs.  It also features a theatre, a scenic cafe, a gift shop, meeting rooms, rooftop observation deck and interactive exhibits.   	Spearheaded by Harry Enns, former minister of natural resources, and Claude Wilson, former president of Ducks Unlimited Canada, the interpretive centre first opened its doors in 1993.  Since then, Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Manitoba government have worked together to manage the interpretive centre.   	Located east of Stonewall, Oak Hammock Marsh is a 36-square-kilometre marsh that features a restored prairie marsh, aspen-oak bluff, artesian springs and some of Manitoba’s last remaining patches of tall-grass prairie.  Its interpretive centre welcomes close to 100,000 students, tourists and environmental professionals annually who can explore 30 kilometres of trails and lush natural habitat that is home to 25 species of mammals, 300 species of birds, numerous amphibians, reptiles, fish and invertebrates.

The minister noted this investment supports the goals of the province’s Policing and Public Safety Strategy and the Safer Streets, Safer Lives Strategy, as it reduces extraneous demands on police resources and ensures RCMP officers are able to focus on front-line policing services in their communities.   	The province continues to support other initiatives that reduce extraneous demands on police resources, which helps ensure more officers are actively serving their communities, the minister noted.  For example, amendments to The Provincial Offences Act came into effect in 2017 to allow written evidence to be submitted to the court by police officers, instead of having to attend hearings and present their evidence in person.  As a result, court attendance by police officers, including Winnipeg Police Service, the RCMP and other police services, has significantly decreased.   	The Manitoba government also recently announced plans to invest $1.9 million to support the expansion of RCMP crime reduction and enforcement teams including a five-member unit for the eastern district.  Crime reduction teams focus on serious, prolific offenders and drug dealers.  The province’s investment will establish a new five-member team in the eastern district, a new five-member team in the western district and support the expansion of an existing northern team.  Additional officers will also join the D Division Enforcement Team, a centralized unit targeting criminal organizations and street gangs that traffic drugs and guns throughout the province.   	The decision to shift transportation and court security responsibilities to sheriff’s officers also builds on the strategic direction set out under Manitoba’s Criminal Justice System Modernization Strategy, which focuses on crime prevention and improving service delivery.    	- 30 -  	   "

The minister noted similar residency programs have proven successful in recruitment and retention of physicians in other regions such as Prairie Mountain Health and Southern Health-Santé Sud.  Most recently, Selkirk became a site for family medicine residency training in the Interlake-Eastern health region in 2019.   	“We’re excited to be expanding into the northern health region with residents living and working in Thompson,” said Dr. José François, medical director of Shared Health’s family medicine program, and head of the Department of Family Medicine at the Max Rady College of Medicine.  “This new site offers residents an opportunity to absorb the rewards of a northern practice and setting while meeting the diverse needs of the communities in and around Thompson.”   	While the program is based out of Thompson, trainees will complete core training rotations across the region, preparing residents to provide care across diverse environments including community hospitals, health centres, nursing stations and care homes in First Nation, rural and remote communities.   	Addressing the unique health needs and inequities of Indigenous populations in the region is a core skill for family physicians working in the north.  The 2016 census data shows that 71 per cent of the people living in the northern health region self-identify as Indigenous.   	The university has redistributed two of its seats from the family medicine northern and remote stream residency program basing it in Thompson.  Medical residents will be selected for these training opportunities through the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) for positions beginning in July 2020.   	The residency program provides an excellent opportunity for trainees to gain effective cultural safety proficiency, become involved in advocacy and self-reflection by learning alongside preceptors, education partners, knowledge keepers, local leaders and the patients of the Northern Regional Health Authority.   	“We believe this program will help physicians better understand the opportunities they can find while practising in northern Manitoba,” said Helga Bryant, chief executive officer Northern Regional Health Authority.  “Our medical teams are very excited to provide training opportunities for new physicians, while enhancing access to care for northern residents.”   	For more information on the family medicine residency program at the University of Manitoba, visit: http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/health_sciences/medicine/units/family_medicine/postgrad/index.html.   	- 30 -  "

The current outflow is being reduced to 100 cubic feet per second (cfs) from 500 cfs, which will result in a two-to-three foot water level decrease on the Assiniboine River from Shellmouth to the town of Russell, and one to two ft. from Russell to Brandon.  The decrease will amount to between zero and one ft. as the lower river flow reaches Winnipeg in about two weeks.   	The province will continue to monitor conditions on the upper Assiniboine River, as well as downstream river levels, and may revise the outflow if conditions change.      	Meanwhile, the ice-jam mitigation program has started on the Red River north of Winnipeg.  Ice cutting is underway, with the Amphibex fleet and support equipment being transported north of Selkirk to begin the first section of icebreaking near Netley Lake today.   	- 30 -  "

We are committed to continuing a meaningful and respectful consultation process with Indigenous communities who will be affected by this important climate-change mitigation project.   	Building positive, respectful and inclusive partnerships with Indigenous people and communities is fundamental to enhancing and increasing Indigenous participation in Manitoba’s economy, and it is also critically important for advancing reconciliation through a principled approach.   	Manitoba has engaged with all 39 Indigenous communities and groups that are potentially impacted; we have 1,083 individual records of communication and have held 139 meetings with Indigenous communities and groups in regards to this project.  The Manitoba government has already spent more than $650,000 on engagement and consultation.   	Currently, we are working with the federal government through a conformity review process regarding the Environmental Impact Statement.  Once the federal government approves the statement, the project will be advanced to the technical review stage and the next phase of consultation will begin.   	Manitoba is in the process of signing consultation agreements with communities for this next phase, and to date, has signed consultation agreements with Lake St. Martin First Nation and the following Interlake Reserves Tribal Council (IRTC) communities:  Dauphin River First Nation, Lake Manitoba First Nation and Kinonjeoshetoegon First Nation.  Six more agreements are currently being finalized.   	This next phase will build upon our ongoing dialogue with communities and will follow the requirements laid out in both provincial and federal consultation processes.

The master plan will include an inventory of campus facilities and clinical services, and will consider what shifts in the location of specific clinical services will support the site’s ability to meet both current and future population needs.   	“Our government is making significant capital investments at HSC including the new Ambulatory Care Clinic, the opening of Women’s Hospital, the Acute Stroke Unit and the Mental Health Crisis Response Centre.  Therefore, it is essential to have the comprehensive view of the development of the campus,” said Friesen.   	Partner organizations across the HSC campus along with the Health Sciences Centre Foundation, CancerCare Manitoba Foundation and Children’s Hospital Foundation will be consulted as part of the process to ensure the long-term capital needs of all stakeholders including Cadham Provincial Laboratory, CancerCare Manitoba and the University of Manitoba are considered in the development of the overall plan, Friesen added.   	The HSC campus encompasses 39 acres of land with more than four million square feet of occupied space.  Its boundaries are Notre Dame Avenue to the south, Sherbrook Street to the east, William Avenue to the north and Tecumseh Street to the west.   	“Any campus redevelopment must take into account the priorities and population health needs of Manitobans,” said Dr. Brock Wright, president and CEO, Shared Health.  “A longer-term approach to the clinical services we provide and the physical infrastructure we share with our partners will ensure that we are able to meet the needs of Manitoba patients, both today and into the future.”   	The minister noted this will be the first in a series of master planning efforts for the health-care system and aligns with the work of the provincial clinical plan.   	“Unlike the former government, we recognize the importance of thoughtful, long-term planning, particularly in health care,” said Friesen.  “These reviews will look at changes in health-care delivery models to ensure we are working together as a province to provide better health care sooner for all Manitobans.”   	For more information on Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg, visit www.hsc.mb.ca/.

This is a critical step toward furthering true reconciliation in Manitoba.”   	The province’s Northern Airports and Marine Operations (NAMO) has a network of 23 airports and five marine facilities. The network covers an area of Manitoba from Selkirk north to Sayisi Dene First Nation and from Brochet east to Shamattawa First Nation. The northern airports and ferry infrastructure provides a lifeline for remote communities, as it enables the transportation of medical patients, essential supplies such as food and medication, and provincial service staff from several departments.   	Throughout the negotiation process, the premier committed to maintaining this vital service at current or improved levels, and finding a solution that ensures uninterrupted, reliable and cost-effective services for all Manitobans who rely on them.   	“The AMC leadership has been resolute for many years on the need for improved transport infrastructure, including air services, for our First Nations across our traditional territories,” said Dumas. “Discussions with government officials and representatives from the private sector on the creation of a Manitoba First Nations Airport Authority represent a critical first step towards First Nations control of air transport and marine infrastructure. On behalf of the AMC, I commend the premier and Province of Manitoba for their efforts at strengthening our relationship through economic reconciliation.”   	Building on the sale of Grace Lake Airport near The Pas to Missinippi Airways in 2019, the province expanded its discussions with Indigenous partners through the AMC to consider transferring assets, ownership and operations of NAMO to the jurisdiction of Manitoba’s First Nations.   	“The Barren Lands First Nation welcomes this important announcement as a sign of good faith by the Province of Manitoba,” said Chief John Clarke. “I applaud my colleagues within the AMC leadership for their vision and determination for First Nations-led transport independence, and recognize the political will of the government of Manitoba for joining us at the discussion table for joint planning on the way forward for Manitoba First Nations air transport infrastructure.”       	The province and AMC will work diligently in the coming months in hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with a smooth transition of assets beginning this summer.

Manitoba now has the second-lowest unemployment rate in Canada.   	The province’s labour force has increased by 1.1 per cent, while the country’s rate as a whole increased by 0.1 per cent.   	Manitoba is a leader with amongst the highest per-capita private-sector investment growth across the country, according to Statistics Canada. The premier noted the growth and business confidence in Manitoba shows the success of the government’s Economic Growth Action Plan, a plan to create 40,000 jobs in the province over the next four years.   	The new provincial Economic Development Office is emphasizing teamwork, improved co-ordination, reduced duplication and the elimination of red tape to help create clear pathways for investors and entrepreneurs.   	“The premier has led the way in the fight to break down siloes, reduce trade barriers and lower taxes, and our government continues to create a business-friendly environment that has led to the largest month-over-month employment increase in Manitoba in more than 10 years,” said Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler. “We continue to remove obstacles to economic growth and investment to move Manitoba forward.”   	Manitoba’s employment level increased by 6,500, which amounts to a one per cent increase, above the 0.2 per cent increase for the rest of the country as a whole. Full-time employment in Manitoba grew by about 1,500 in January.   	- 30 -  "

Nearly 24 per cent of residents in the region live with hypertension, higher than the provincial average of 20.7 per cent, making the new site an ideal location for the service to be expanded.   	Echocardiograms provide an ultrasound for the heart and can offer a timely diagnosis for various forms of heart disease. Once fully operational, up to 1,620 scans per year will be performed at the new site, which will begin accepting patients this Wednesday.   	All scans performed in Selkirk will be non-urgent and elective, with the results interpreted by cardiologists at Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg (HSC). Urgent or complex scans will continue to be referred to HSC or St. Boniface Hospital.   	“This community-led initiative builds upon our health system’s capacity to offer specialized services outside of Winnipeg and addresses a regional need for this service,” said Ron van Denakker, chief executive officer, Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority (IERHA). “We are pleased that the Rotary Club of Selkirk worked with us as they undertook their Project Echo fundraising campaign to help more patients receive this service closer to home.”   	Adding echocardiography services in Selkirk is only the latest in a sustained effort by the Manitoba government to improve provincial wait times for non-urgent and elective scans, the minister noted. Last spring, seven cardiac sonographer positions were added at HSC and St. Boniface Hospital, which has reduced non-urgent and elective wait times by more than 33 per cent since May 2019.   	“Echocardiograms are important tests that assist in the diagnosis of various heart conditions,” said Dr. Brock Wright, chief executive officer, Shared Health. “Expanding the service to Selkirk will align with recommendations made in Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan to build up local capacity for specialized services and enable rural and northern patients the ability to receive the care they need without having to travel to Winnipeg.”   	Shared Health and the IERHA have hired a full-time cardiac sonographer and clerk to support the new unit, which will be located in previously-unused space at the newly-constructed health centre.   	The Rotary Club of Selkirk raised approximately $200,000 to purchase the medical equipment required to bring echocardiography services to the region. Eleven different municipalities throughout the health region contributed to the project, as did 31 community groups, local businesses, Hutterite colonies and dozens of individuals.   	“The continued improvement of health services is important to all Manitobans, including those of us who live in the Interlake-Eastern RHA,” said Jean Oliver, vice-president of the Rotary Club of Selkirk and co-chair of Project Echo. “We are thrilled to partner on this meaningful initiative that will have a positive impact on the heart health of Interlake-Eastern communities and all Manitobans.”   	Manitoba has seen recent success in other specialized services. Wait times for hip and knee replacements and cardiac surgeries have reduced significantly since the fall of 2018, when the government invested an additional $5.3 million to perform additional procedures.  Since that time, wait times for hip and knee surgeries have improved by more than 21 per cent year-over-year. Similarly, waits for cataract surgeries have improved province-wide.   	To read Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan, visit: www.gov.mb.ca/health/hst/docs/cpsp_overview.pdf.   	- 30 -  "

As of Feb. 13, 15 tests have been completed for the novel coronavirus in Manitoba.  At this time, there are no laboratory-confirmed cases here.   	Suspected and confirmed cases of novel coronavirus are required to be reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.  To date, seven cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in Canada.  All confirmed cases are in Ontario and British Columbia.   	In light of the evolving knowledge of the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus, PHAC is recommending that travellers who have been in the province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, self-isolate for 14 days after departing the area.  PHAC is also recommending that travellers returning from the rest of mainland China self-monitor for 14 days from when they left mainland China.  For information on self-isolation visit www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/factsheets/coronavirus_selfisolation.pdf.   	If you are ill with symptoms that may include fever, cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, and have recently traveled to an affected area, or if you are ill and have been in close contact (within two metres/six feet) with an ill person connected to the current outbreak, call Health Links–Info Santé at 788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for advice on where to seek care.  If it is an emergency, call 911.   	At this time, public health officials are not recommending the use of masks in public places, as there is no evidence that wearing masks significantly reduces the risk of getting the virus in this context.   	Common prevention measures for viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, influenza and others.  include regular hand washing with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  It is important to clean your hands:  	•    after coughing or sneezing;  	•    when caring for a sick person;  	•    before, during and after food preparation;  	•    before eating;  	•    after toilet use; and  	•    when hands are visibly dirty.   	Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.   	PHAC has issued travel health notices about coronavirus.  For more information, visit:https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/210?_ga=2.260947853.1094428749.1578423601-32662530.1555003301.

The Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) and the province of Manitoba will each invest $600,000 annually over four years to support work on the project.   	“This project demonstrates the power of research in improving the health of Canadians and enhancing the health care experience for patients while making health care systems more effective and efficient,” said Dr. Tammy Clifford, vice president, research programs, CIHR. “This is an excellent example of a collaborative effort supported through our SPOR program.”  	   	Three physicians at the University of Manitoba are leading the project, each focusing on a different area of health care and how timely access to data can be used to:  	• create efficiencies to reduce the need for blood transfusions and ensure appropriate care is provided during surgeries;  	• enhance the use of home dialysis to ensure care is delivered closer to home for rural patients; and  	• enhance navigation to health care for cancer patients to ensure timely access to care, particularly in rural and northern Manitoba.   	“Mindset, the Manitoba integrated data platform, will transform how patients and providers access, and are informed by, health data,” said team lead Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, associate professor of medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine and senior scientist, Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology. “Developed with diverse stakeholders, including patients and the Government of Manitoba and the federal government, the province-wide platform will be the first of its kind in Canada and transformational for our province. It will help promote the efficient functioning and sustainability of our health system and will improve the lives of all Manitobans.”   	The minister noted these projects will inform how data is collected and used in real time as the province’s health-system transformation moves forward.   	“As we develop one system for data collection, information management and analysis, it’s important to find out what kind of data is needed and how it can be provided in more timely ways so that we can support patients and ensure quality care,” said Friesen. “This project will guide our investments in this area in the months and years ahead and allow us to maximize the benefits as we continue to transform the health care system, and provide Manitobans what they have long deserved, better health care sooner.”   	The SPOR Rewarding Success initiative was established in 2017 to address complex health problems. The initiative provides funding in a way similar to social impact bonds, where a portion of any economic benefits from research projects are reinvested to conduct further research studies.       	For more information on SPOR, visit CIHR’s website at https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/41204.html.     	- 30 -   	   "

Close to 75 per cent of newcomers who land in Manitoba are of working age and contribute significantly to Manitoba’s labour force growth.  Within the past five years, 88 per cent of the labour force growth in the province has resulted directly from immigration in response to Manitoba’s increasing demand for workers.   	Many Manitoba employers and growing industries such as information technology are increasingly reliant on expertise and talent from outside Canada, as the worker-to-retiree ratio narrows and birth rates stabilize or fall.   	“By working in collaboration with the business community, post-secondary institutions, other levels of government and invested stakeholders, Manitoba will continue to spur innovation while developing a competitive edge, growing and attracting top talent domestically and abroad,” said Eichler.  “Immigration will continue to bring newcomers to the province and build a thriving economy for all Manitobans.”   	- 30 -  "

Pedersen noted the research project will target the highest-known predation areas and emerging problem areas.  Currently, the highest incidence of predation is in the northern Interlake and Parkland regions.   	The governments of Canada and Manitoba currently provide compensation to affected producers through the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program, up to a maximum of $3,000 per animal.  This program has paid producers an average of more than $1.8 million annually in compensation in recent years.   	- 30 -  "

South in Portage la Prairie.   	The session will give motorists and residents the opportunity to discuss safety enhancements, potential access modifications and temporary detours, as well as land-use plans and development in the municipality and surrounding area.   	In March 2018, the province announced plans to replace the bridge, built in 1968 as part of the Trans-Canada Highway bypass around Portage la Prairie.  The low structure is below modern height standards and several vehicles have collided with the bridge in recent years.  Damage has reduced traffic to one lane over the bridge and diverted vehicles through the city route.   	The province is developing a new overpass design that will improve traffic operations, enhance safety at ramp entrances and exists, and resolve operational and safety issues.

As of Feb. 5, 10 tests have been completed for the novel coronavirus in Manitoba.  At this time, there are no laboratory-confirmed cases here.   	Suspected and confirmed cases of novel coronavirus are required to be reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.  To date, five cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in Canada.  All confirmed cases are in Ontario and British Columbia.   	In light of the evolving knowledge of the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus, PHAC is recommending that travellers who have been in the province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, self-isolate for 14 days following arrival in Canada.  PHAC is also recommending that travellers returning from the rest of mainland China self-monitor for 14 days following arrival in Canada.   	Early evidence indicates the novel coronavirus can cause a range of mild to severe symptoms.  It is possible that individuals will not recognize when they first develop symptoms because they can be similar to a cold or flu.   	The steps to limit contact with others if you are self-isolating include:  	•    avoiding individuals with chronic conditions, compromised immune systems and senior citizens;    	•    avoiding having visitors to your home;  	•    avoiding situations such as social gatherings, work, school, daycare, health-care facilities and seniors residences;  	•    avoiding taking public transit, taxis and ride sharing;    	•    washing your hands often with soap and warm water frequently for at least 15 to 20 seconds; and  	•    covering your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing.   	If recent travellers develop a fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in the 14 days following their departure from province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, or from the rest of mainland China or if they have been in contact with a case who has, and they are seeking health care, it is important to call ahead.  Individuals can call to their local urgent care centre or emergency department or Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free).   	At this time, public health officials are not recommending use of masks in public places, as there is no evidence that wearing masks significantly reduces the risk of getting the virus.   	Common prevention measures for viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, influenza and others.  include regular hand washing with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  It is important to clean your hands:  	•    after coughing or sneezing;  	•    when caring for a sick person;  	•    before, during and after food preparation;  	•    before eating;  	•    after toilet use; and  	•    when hands are visibly dirty.   	Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.

In consultation with industry, MI periodically revises its policies and procedures to reflect current transportation trends, industry needs and weather patterns.  This year, it considered new criteria for changes on restricted roads, including pavement condition and traffic level, which resulted in more removals and reductions than the past few years.   	The province has removed restrictions on:  	•    Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 21 from the north junction of Provincial Road (PR) 355 to First Avenue in Shoal Lake;  	•    PR 206 from the south junction of PR 210 to the north junction of PR 210 in Landmark;  	•    PR 210 from PR 207 to PTH 12;  	•    PR 247 from PR 334 to PTH 3;  	•    PR 272 from PTH 20 to Duck Bay;  	•    PR 285 from PTH 10 to Sinclair Road;  	•    PR 326 from PR 329 to the east junction River Road in Arborg; and  	•    Sperring Avenue for 2.9 km south and west of PR 202 in Birds Hill.   	The province has reduced spring restriction levels from 65 per cent to 90 per cent of normal loading weight on:  	•    PTH 34 from PTH 1 to PTH 16;  	•    PR 244 from PTH 3 to PTH 23;  	•    PR 248 from PTH 1 to PTH 26;  	•    PR 305 from 11.3 km north of PTH 2 to the Assiniboine River;  	•    PR 422 from PTH 23 to PR 205;  	•    PR 428 from PTH 23 to PTH 14; and  	•    PR 643 (St. Laurent access) from the south junction of PTH 6 to 2.6 km west.   	The province has not added any new restrictions for spring 2020.   	Based on thawing in designated climate zones, spring road restrictions are generally in place from early March until early June.  Motor carriers, farmers, businesses and other interested parties can learn more about spring road restrictions at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/srr/index.html.   	- 30 -  "

The province will build on the existing network of provincial recycling programs and working with industry, municipalities and other stewardship organizations, propose to develop a plan to introduce industry-funded stewardship programs for all corded appliances by 2022, the minister added.   	- 30 -  "

The five companies receiving grants are forecasting a total addition of 272 new full-time jobs and 45 part-time jobs over the next five years.  The Innovation Growth Program is cost-shared with recipients, while the Province of Manitoba provides up to 50 per cent of total project costs.   	These projects will also lend support to the Manitoba Works Plan to create 40,000 new jobs across the province over the next four years, while also supporting the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan by assisting companies that are developing technologies in clean tech areas.   	The Innovation Growth Program was launched in June 2019 as a key element of Manitoba’s Economic Growth Action Plan.   	Applications for the next program intake will be accepted until March 16.

Mike Lesiuk, a former provincial director of agricultural policy, will lead the review.  It will ask forage producers for their perceptions about insurance products, how they currently manage risks and how the program can evolve to support growth in Manitoba’s livestock sector.   	The review will also include an environmental scan of other programs available in Canada and related research.  Recommendations will be provided to MASC and the minister later this spring.

Since November 2019, precipitation is tracking below to well-below normal in most parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  However, precipitation in the United States portions of the Red and Souris rivers are tracking as much as 150 to 300 per cent of normal accumulation.     	Frost depth is below normal in most areas.  As moist and frozen soils reduce infiltration of meltwater and increase spring run-off, below-normal frost depth is considered a favourable condition in reducing the extent of spring run-off.   	Base flows and levels in Manitoba rivers have been declining since the fall of 2019, but are still above normal for southern and northern Manitoba, and normal to above normal in central Manitoba basins.   	Manitoba’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is starting to build its first full Flood Outlook, which will be released in late February.  Forecasters will compile data from several sources including points south and west of Manitoba.  Weather developments from now through April will largely determine the occurrence, extent and severity of spring run-off in 2020.   	Spring run-off in Manitoba rivers is dependent on soil moisture, snow cover, soil frost depth, base flow and levels of rivers, along with the snow melt rate and the amount and timing of the spring rain.  Peak flows on Manitoba rivers are also dependent on the timing of peak flows from the United States and Saskatchewan portions of the basins.

The report was a collaborative work between the Province of Manitoba and City of Winnipeg, along with advisory input from stakeholder groups Lake Winnipeg Foundation, International Institute of Sustainable Development, Lake Winnipeg Indigenous Collective and South Basin Mayors and Reeves, and is based on work undertaken by the City of Winnipeg as reported in the December 31, 2019, progress report submitted to the province.   	The report includes an overview of all three phases of the City of Winnipeg’s plan for the North End Winnipeg Pollution Control Centre (NEWPCC) project including cost estimates and preliminary timeframe for completion of the NEWPCC upgrade. Both the Province of Manitoba and the City of Winnipeg are committed to expediting the schedule whenever possible and will continue to identify opportunities to implement nutrient removal as soon as possible. The City of Winnipeg’s existing nutrient removal plan has been in progress since the NEWPCC Master Plan was approved in 2014. Phase 1 – Power Supply and Headworks Facility – will see the power supply upgrade completed in 2020 and a request for proposals on a design-build contract for the Headworks Facility will be issued in 2020. Phase 2 – Biosolids Facility – will see design work initiated in 2020 following City Council’s approval of the 2020-23 sewer rates.   	The Project Advisory Committee (PAC) will continue to receive monthly reports on the progress, allowing for accountability, urgency and transparency in finding timeline efficiencies and identifying barriers early. The province and city appreciate the expertise, advice and valuable contributions from the committee. An update on timelines is due July 31. The PAC will continue to look for opportunities to accelerate the plan without compromising the safety and function of Winnipeg’s North End Sewage Treatment Plant.   	“The province is pleased to move forward on this vital project to ensure the health and sustainability of Lake Winnipeg and our waterways,” Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard said. “We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively and efficiently with the Project Advisory Committee and the City of Winnipeg in expediting upgrades to the North End Sewage Treatment Plant for the benefit of all Manitobans.”   	“I’m pleased to see the work of the Project Advisory Committee has confirmed the existing City of Winnipeg interim plan to reduce phosphorous from the North End Sewage Treatment Plant,” said Mayor Brian Bowman. “I look forward to continuing our work with the support of the Province of Manitoba to move as quickly as science will allow.”   	Earlier this month, the City of Winnipeg awarded the contract for interim phosphorous removal testing to AECOM following the conclusion of a competitive RFP process. Testing of interim phosphorous removal options will occur through the remainder of 2020, with a final report expected from AECOM by December 31. A recommendation report on interim phosphorous removal is expected to be presented to Manitoba Conservation and Climate and to City Council for review and approval as soon as possible with the intention of expediting timelines safely throughout the year.   	The PAC and Project Steering Committee will continue to meeting regularly, with progress reports being submitted to Manitoba Conservation and Climate monthly.

The province has already been working with child welfare authorities, the health-care sector and other partners to lay the groundwork for moving away from birth alerts by April 1.  This will help ensure systems are better integrated to provide comprehensive, wrap-around supports for mothers, children and families.   	“Our priority is to help keep families together and reduce the number of children in care,” said Stefanson.  “We are shifting our focus toward better supports for expectant mothers including early interventions, reunification and better planning.”   	The minister noted the end of birth alerts will not affect the child welfare system’s ability to protect children who are at risk of neglect or abuse. All Manitobans, including health-care providers, continue to have a legislated duty to report if they think a child is at risk.   	Manitoba’s decision to end birth alerts builds on the recommendations of the Child Welfare Legislative Review Committee.  Indigenous leadership, including the Southern Chiefs Organization, Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, have also called for an end to this practice.   	The Manitoba government continues to develop programs to help connect families with the supports they need.  This includes Wednesday’s launch of Granny’s House, which will provide temporary, culturally-safe respite care, as well as the Indigenous doula social impact bond led by the Southern First Nations Network of Care.   	- 30 -  BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

Manitoba has the third-highest spending per student in Canada at $14,733, after Saskatchewan and New Brunswick.   	“This investment in our public schools demonstrates our government’s commitment to students’ success,” said Goertzen.  “This funding is the most ever committed to public schools in Manitoba’s history.  Since 2016, funding to elementary and secondary education has grown by nearly $33 million.”   	The funding comes in addition to the province’s guarantee to build 20 new schools during the next decade.  Two new schools in Winkler and Niverville have been completed and are in use by students.  Three new elementary schools in Brandon and Winnipeg are under construction and will open later this year.  An additional two new schools in Waverley West are being designed and are scheduled to begin construction before the end of this year, the minister said.  In addition, school expansions are happening across the province with openings this week in Neepawa and La Salle.   	The cost of these 20 new schools is approximately $500 million, Goertzen said.   	The province will also continue to ensure all school divisions receive no less than 98 per cent of the operating funding they received a year earlier.   	“Like all levels of government, school divisions need to make choices and carefully prioritize spending decisions,” said Goertzen.    	School division administration expenses topped $65 million in 2018-19.  To increase transparency, the Department of Education has released an out-of-province travel summary for school divisions.  This disclosure of travel expenses is similar to what is in use for Manitoba members of the legislative assembly and cabinet ministers. A list of school divisions' out-of-province travel expenses can be found at www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/finance/sd-opt/index.html.   	The minister noted that school divisions currently have an accumulated operating surplus in excess of $98,000,000.   	School divisions, as well, raise revenue through local education property taxes.  The minister is again requesting that school divisions limit increases to education property taxes to a maximum of two per cent for the 2020-21 school year.   	The government looks forward to receiving the final report of the Commission on Kindergarten to Grade 12 Education, which has an expected public release at the end of March.  The commission is leading a comprehensive and independent review of Manitoba’s entire public elementary and secondary education system.   	- 30 -  "

The minister noted the feedback will be reviewed in greater detail to help develop a preliminary program design and the next stage of consultations.   	The creation of the new income support program for Manitobans with severe and prolonged disabilities remains a priority for the province, the minister said, noting it is part of the department’s 12-month strategic action plan.  Shared Priorities, Sustainable Progress was released earlier this month and is available online at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/pubs/shared-priorities-sustainable-progress.pdf.   	- 30 -  "

These steps build upon earlier government initiatives, such as reducing the size of cabinet, leading by example on internal compensation levels, reducing the number of managers in core government by 15 per cent, reviewing the spans and layers in the civil service, guiding collective bargaining by sustainability considerations throughout the public sector and introducing the recent The Public Sector Executive Compensation Act.   	Specific directives to Crowns, post-secondary institutions and school divisions on executive compensation levels mirror those previously adopted by the provincial government including a 1.75 per cent cap over four years.  The directive includes:  	•    no increases for the first 24-month period and where current terms and conditions of employment provide for one or more salary increases, this directive shall take effect one year after the last increase takes effect;   	•    no more than 0.75 per cent increase for the next 12-month period; and  	•    no more than one per cent increase for the final 12-month period.   	“We’re committed to ensuring that appropriate management structures and practices are in place to deliver the best services and value for money.  This includes ensuring that front-line voices can be most effectively heard,” said Fielding.  “Taxpayers’ dollars should be prioritized on front-line services – next to the student, the ratepayer and the customer – for better outcomes.”   	The province has also initiated a tender process to engage consulting services to review and assess executive compensation, classification approaches and optimum spans and layers of management.  The help of outside experts will ensure this centrally co-ordinated review reflects best practices and is fairly applied across the broader public service, said Fielding.   	- 30 -  "

Manitoba Education is working in partnership with parents, schools and communities to support and improve regular daily attendance for all students.”   	The Manitoba government has issued a request for proposals (RFP) to look at best practices in other jurisdictions for improving and maintaining student attendance. The RFP will close on Feb. 3, 2020. The RFP comes after Manitoba Education established an attendance task force, which includes community members and school division representatives and is co-chaired by the deputy ministers of Education and Justice.   	The minister noted regular daily attendance at school is critical not only for education, but for the protection of children and youth, especially the most vulnerable, in improving their outcomes. Conversely, school absenteeism is connected with poor outcomes such as justice involvement or mental illness and addictions. These efforts will help address concerns raised by the Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth, who recommended that the province examine attendance, suspension and expulsion policies to ensure that vulnerable children get the supports they need.   	Manitoba Education has a leadership role across government departments and with community agencies to promote student attendance.   	- 30 -  "

The eight new, state-of-the-art classrooms have communications connectivity needed today and for the future, and accommodate up to 200 students to allow them to move out of modular classroom facilities.  The new facilities and learning spaces support the educational mission of the Province of Manitoba and the Beautiful Plains School Division.   	“A large, multi-disciplinary group of people came together to deliver this facility that will be a wonderful addition to the community of Neepawa for generations,” said Goertzen.  “I am excited that the students and families of Neepawa will have a better place to learn and play.”     	- 30 -  "

Granny’s House is also supported by the Grandmothers Council, an advisory group responsible for providing advice to the minister on Indigenous issues.     	“This is our time to take back the true spirit of Indigenous ways of taking care of and healing our children,” said Mae Louise Campbell, elder and member of the Grandmothers Council.     	Funding for Granny’s House is part of the government’s broader commitment to address mental health and addictions issues.  Other recently announced initiatives valued at more than $25 million include a request for proposals to add 100 supportive recovery-housing beds, recruiting new community helpers, investing in a collaboration between StreetReach Winnipeg and the Manitoba Adolescent Treatment Centre, and expanding the distribution of Thrival Kits.   	- 30 -  "

The report was presented to government in December 2019, and the province has moved quickly to review its findings and prioritize the recommendations.   	As recommended, the province will work towards making blood lead levels in excess of established guidelines reportable under The Public Health Act.  This move will assist the province to track and better understand where lead exposure may continue to pose a problem.  This new information will help focus future public health and environmental efforts where they are needed and will have the greatest impact.   	MHSAL and MCC will also move forward with the recommendation to develop a communications and outreach plan that delivers a single, clear and effective message to the public and key stakeholders about how to mitigate potential risks.  This could include a public webpage or social media platform with regular updates for information sharing, and training for parents and caregivers of young children, as well as child care centres, community centres and preschools.   	MHSAL and MCC will continue to work with Manitoba Education and school divisions to develop a plan to address recommendations for Weston School.   	Given the primary source of lead emissions in Winnipeg are no longer present, the health risk of lead for Manitobans is low.  The report stressed that soil remediation was not recommended as a course of action.  	   	To view the independent report’s findings and recommendations, visit: https://manitoba.ca/openmb/infomb/departments.html.   	The public is reminded to take precautions to prevent contact with lead impacted soil.  These actions can include avoiding ingestion of soil including preventing children from eating soil and washing hands after working with soil.  If homes have a lead service line or lead solder or fixtures containing lead in the plumbing system, take steps to reduce exposure.  Talk to local water suppliers for more information.   	In communities that have a corrosion control program, such as the City of Winnipeg, run the tap until the water is cold before drinking the water or using it to prepare food or infant formula.  In other communities, additional steps, such as a point-of-use filter to reduce lead to acceptable levels may be needed.   	Individuals who have concerns about their exposure to lead are encouraged to speak to their health-care provider.  Additional information is available in the lead in water fact sheet at www.gov.mb.ca/sd/pubs/water/drinking_water/rld_homechildcare.pdf.

Capital improvements, staff training, new or replacement equipment, and clinical practice changes are all eligible for consideration in the first wave, which will be managed by Shared Health.   	“As we construct a more reliable provincial health system, investments in tools, equipment and providers will be necessary to build capacity for care closer to home across the province,” said Lanette Siragusa, provincial lead, health system integration and quality, Shared Health.  “Upgrading skills and knowledge, standardizing clinical practices and improving access to care at home and in the community, will improve outcomes across the health system.”   	Projects will be evaluated based on expected outcomes, with successful initiatives to be launched over the coming months, the minister noted.   	“This fund is an investment in the exceptional care provided by staff across our health system each and every day,” said Friesen.  “I have every confidence the quality improvement and innovation proposals made by health system leaders, clinical experts and front-line staff will have significant positive impacts on health access and outcomes for Manitobans.”   	The new Idea Fund for Health builds on the 2018 launch of the government-wide Idea Fund, which supports a whole-of-government approach to modernizing the civil service and finding better ways to do things including shopping smarter and spending taxpayer dollars more effectively and efficiently.   	- 30 -  BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "

Suspected and confirmed cases of novel coronavirus are required to be reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.     	Those who meet the criteria will be placed in a designated separate waiting room.  Appropriate infection prevention and control measures will be put in place while the client receives care including the use of surgical masks.  If a case is confirmed by laboratory testing, public health will promptly followup with close contacts to take appropriate precautions and monitor for symptoms.   	To date, two Canadian cases of the virus have been confirmed, a couple from Toronto that recently returned from Wuhan.  Out of an abundance of caution, two Manitoba patients with uncertain travel histories have been tested for novel coronavirus in recent days.  Both tested negative for the virus and positive for the common cold, said Friesen.   	“The risk remains low and we remain hopeful that we will not see confirmed cases of the virus in our province, but we are prepared in the event it does,” the minister said.  “We have excellent infection and prevention control procedures in place to help reduce the risk of illness.  Our proximity to the National Microbiology Laboratory, where confirmatory testing for the virus is occurring, is also a clear benefit to Manitobans in ensuring results are delivered promptly.”   	Public health officials in Manitoba are working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the World Health Organization to monitor the situation as it evolves.   	Global Affairs Canada announced Monday that Canadians should avoid all travel to the Hubei province of China, where Wuhan is located.   	Individuals with recent travel to Wuhan or contact with a recent traveller who currently have symptoms such as a cough, fever, sore throat, runny nose, headache, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties should contact their health-care provider or Health Links at 204-788-8200 or  	1-888-315-9257 (toll-free).   	Common prevention measures include regular hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  It is important to wash your hands:  	•    after coughing or sneezing;  	•    when caring for a sick person;  	•    before, during and after food preparation;  	•    before eating;  	•    after toilet use; and  	•    when hands are visibly dirty.   	Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.   	PHAC has issued travel health notices about coronavirus.

The minister noted a priority area for the management council is to provide advice respecting the amounts paid to private lawyers for work conducted on behalf of legal aid clients.   	The report was written by Allan Fineblit, a well-respected legal expert who has most recently reviewed Manitoba’s family law system and has previously worked in numerous roles connected to legal aid throughout his career.  In December 2019, Fineblit was appointed as the chairperson of the Legal Aid Management Council, along with several other new members.

Wahbung Abinoonjiiag will work closely with family violence shelters, other organizations that provide longer-term protective and supportive housing, and women’s resource centres to ensure women and children affected by family violence are connected to appropriate social housing.  To date, several properties have been selected and work is underway to support the transition.  To protect the safety and privacy of families, locations will not be disclosed.  	   	“Organizations like Wahbung Abinoonjiiag and their partners understand how important a stable, safe home can be for women and children as they start a new life,” said Cox.  “These families can feel supported, knowing their housing provider also has expertise and understanding related to their situation.  We believe this partnership will help more women and children to heal and thrive.”  	   	”Wahbung Abinoonjiiag is honoured to be selected to lead this important initiative,” said Dana Riccio-Arabe, executive director.  “Our partnership model works in collaboration with sister organizations to provide wrap-around supports and services for children and their families affected by violence to have safe, affordable housing to call home.  We would like to thank the province for selecting our organization, our partnership model for their collective wisdom, and our community for trusting us to lead this important work.  Together, we can not only envision but actively work toward a place and time where children and their families can live free of violence and unrestrained by the impacts of violence.”   	Wahbung Abinoonjiiag expects to begin taking referrals for housing needs this spring.   	“Our government is proud to form important partnerships with community-based Indigenous organizations like Wahbung Abinoonjiiag,” said Clarke.  “These are significant steps to advancing reconciliation.”   	Stefanson noted the province’s support for Wahbung Abinoonjiiag builds on housing priorities recently set out in a 12-month department action plan.  It notes priority will be given to populations that face barriers in securing housing, including women and children experiencing domestic violence.  The action plan is available online at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/pubs/shared-priorities-sustainable-progress.pdf.

The design of the courthouse will be finalized in the coming months, with plans to minimize disruptions during renovations, Cullen noted.   	Built in 1917, the adjacent Dauphin Correctional Centre (DCC) is the oldest correctional facility in Manitoba and no longer meets modern correctional needs, and it has reached the end of its serviceability.  Operations will begin winding down at DCC and are expected to cease by the end of May, the minister noted.    	The goal is to provide employment for all employees if possible and the Manitoba government will be working with the Civil Service Commission and the union to find creative ways to do so while respecting the rights and obligations contained in the collective agreement, the minister said.   	“We will be respecting the collective agreement,” Cullen said. “We want to ensure a smooth transition and will be working with the union in the coming days.”   	Those in custody in Dauphin will continue to be held at the six other adult correctional facilities located throughout the province.  There is currently sufficient capacity at the other facilities following an overall decline in the provincial inmate population.  	     	The minister noted these decisions align with the goals set out under the Criminal Justice Modernization Strategy, which was released in March 2018.  It focuses on reducing crime, improving public safety, reducing the number of people coming into conflict with the law and improving access to justice.  The strategy is available online at www.gov.mb.ca/justice.   	- 30 -  "

Approximately 14 per cent of Manitobans live with kidney disease and about one-third of them may develop kidney failure in their lifetime.   	“We know the number of area residents living with end stage kidney disease is increasing,” said Penny Gilson, chief executive officer, Prairie Mountain Health.  “We are responding to this increased demand by continuing to plan prevention initiatives, deliver co-ordinated services and allocate appropriate resources to enhance access to service within the health region.”   	Hemodialysis uses a machine to remove blood from the body, clean it and then return it to the body.  Peritoneal dialysis cycles a solution into and out of the stomach through a tube to collect and get rid of waste and fluid.   	“As Manitoba’s rates of kidney failure continue to rise, expanding these services means more Manitobans will receive this vital treatment as close to home as possible,” said Dr. Mauro Verrelli, medical director of the Manitoba Renal Program.  “At the same time, we continue to work alongside partners and care providers on efforts to prevent or delay kidney failure when possible.”   	The new initiative aligns with Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan, which provides a roadmap for changes that will decrease travel and wait times for patients, bringing improved health-care capacity closer to home.   	It also builds on a $5.2-million investment to provide critical life-saving services for up to 72 patients and support staff in a number of communities including Winnipeg, Thompson, Swan River, Hodgson, Pine Falls, Portage la Prairie and at the Boundary Trails Health Centre (Morden/Winkler).  That investment will create up to 57 additional positions, including nearly 30 nurses, a majority of which have already been filled, Friesen said.  He added, in total, this investment will add an additional 9,672 hemodialysis treatments each year.   	The province has also invested $500,000 to expand the home dialysis programs in Brandon and Winnipeg.  A 22-station hemodialysis unit at Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg is also being constructed that will support up to 132 patients when at full capacity.  Construction is expected to be complete by early 2021, the minister noted.   	For many people, early detection and treatment of kidney disease can help prevent or delay kidney failure or the need for dialysis.  Learn about kidney health and the Manitoba Renal Program at www.kidneyhealth.ca/.   	- 30 -  	   "

A positive trend has been identified in eight crops including red spring wheat, canola, soybeans, grain corn, oats, white pea beans, irrigated processing potatoes and hemp grain.  Probable yields, used to determine insurance coverage, will increase for these crops as a result of implementing yield trending.   	With regular updating, as well as the implementation of yield trending, total insurance coverage will increase to almost $3 billion in 2020 with producers paying premiums similar to 2019.   	Additional program changes for the 2020 growing season include:  	•    MASC will offer the contract price option (CPO) on canola, including specialty oil canola, and field peas.  Manitoba producers have been requesting greater coverage for higher value crops for several years.  This option will allow producers to blend the price from their contracted production with the base AgriInsurance dollar value (weighted by production) to better reflect expected market prices.  	•    Fall rye will be introduced as an eligible crop for organic insurance.  	•    Producers will now be eligible for a reseed benefit on annual novel crops based on 25 per cent of the per acre dollar coverage selected for their novel crops.  If the annual novel crop fails to establish by June 20, a reseed benefit will be available on those acres.  Producers may select from three different coverage levels:  $150, $200 or $250 per acre.  	•    Forages used for extended-season grazing are now eligible for wildlife damage compensation.  This includes crops used for in-field bale and swath grazing, as well as standing annual crops intended for grazing (e.g. corn).  Producers will receive 45 per cent of the value of the loss caused by big game and waterfowl during the extended grazing period.  	•    Strawberries are now an eligible crop under the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program.  Compensation will be available for plant loss, as well as production loss.   	Manitoba has the highest level of AgriInsurance participation in Canada with over 90 per cent of annual crop acres enrolled and more than 8,000 farms are registered in the program.  The total governments’ share of AgriInsurance premium for 2020-21 is expected to be $125.01 million.  AgriInsurance is provided for over 70 different annual crops and forages during establishment and production, as well as for the inability to seed land in the spring due to wet conditions.   	Under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, AgriInsurance premiums for most programs are shared 40 per cent by participating producers, 36 per cent by the Government of Canada and 24 per cent by the Manitoba government.  Administrative expenses are paid 60 per cent by Canada and 40 per cent by Manitoba.   	AgriInsurance is a risk management program administered by MASC.  For more information about it and other programs, visit a MASC office or www.masc.mb.ca.   	- 30 -  "

Following a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yesterday, the premier is calling on the federal government for a fresh evaluation of the province’s Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan to cap the carbon tax on Manitobans.   	“Manitobans deserve respect for our green agenda, our historic and significant investments in clean, green renewable energy,” said Pallister.  “Our plan puts a price on carbon that is low and level, like the Prairies, and keeps more money in the pockets of Manitobans while getting the same amount of emissions reductions as the rising federal carbon tax.  Our Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan is better for the economy, better for the environment and better for Manitoban families.”   	Today’s announcement builds on the government’s climate change and green initiatives to make Manitoba the cleanest, greenest, and most climate resilient province in Canada, through its Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan.  This includes:  	•    investing billions of dollars invested in clean, renewable hydroelectric energy;  	•    eliminating, once and for all, the use of coal for electricity generation;  	•    providing over $200 million for the GROW and Conservation Trust programs to sustain investments in cleaner air, water and soil management;  	•    creating watershed management strategies;  	•    establishing Efficiency Manitoba demand-side management;  	•    introducing fuel-efficiency measures for the trucking industry; and  	•    working with the private sector to eliminate the use of plastic bags.   	- 30 -  "

To be eligible for the award, the land must have been held in continuous ownership by direct descendants of the original owner, with a minimum land area of at least 20.23 hectares (50 acres) over the life of the farm.

Priority will be given to projects that:    		improve relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Manitoba;   		improve the quality of life for Indigenous peoples, particularly with respect to economic development, job creation and educational initiatives;   		support activities that align with the Path to Reconciliation Act, (http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/r030-5e.php), the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s Calls to Action (http://trc.ca/assets/pdf/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf),  and/or the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html); and   		show clear, concrete and positive project benefits that align with the priorities of government as expressed in the provincial speech from the throne(www.gov.mb.ca/thronespeech/),  ministerial mandate letters (www.gov.mb.ca/openmb/infomb/ministerials.html), the 100-Day Action Plan (www.manitoba.ca/asset_library/en/proactive/100-day-action-plan-letter.pdf),  and other provincial strategies and priorities.    	The Indigenous and Northern Initiatives grant program is designed to support small grants of up to $25,000, but consideration will be given to larger proposals that demonstrate significant partnerships and the potential for exceptional regional or provincial impact, the minister said.  Only single-year projects will be considered and the application deadline is Feb. 7.

The estimated payout for 2019 is in excess of $5 million on approximately 1,500 claims, announced Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen.    	“We recognize it has been a difficult harvest for many farmers in Manitoba,” said Bibeau. “The Hay Disaster Benefit is one of the ways our government is supporting farmers to protect their businesses against weather-related risks, such as this forage shortfall.""   	“The Hay Disaster Benefit (HDB) is a complimentary feature of the AgriInsurance program that compensates insured forage producers for the increased cost of hay and transportation when there is a severe provincial forage shortfall,” said Pedersen. “All producers who are enrolled in the Select Hay Insurance and Basic Hay Insurance programs are automatically enrolled in the HDB.”   	The HDB was first introduced in 2014 as part of a revamped forage insurance offering. Payments were made to producers for the first time in 2018.   	All insured hay types (alfalfa, alfalfa grass mixtures, grasses, sweet clover and coarse hay) are eligible.   	To trigger an HDB payment, at least 20 per cent of producers with Select Hay or Basic Hay Insurance must harvest less than 50 per cent of their long-term average hay yield. For 2019, producers will receive an additional $40 for each tonne below their Select Hay or Basic Hay Insurance coverage.   	There is no cost to producers for this benefit. Premiums are cost shared 60 per cent by the Government of Canada and 40 per cent by the Province of Manitoba under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership.   	For more information on forage insurance in Manitoba, contact a MASC office or visit www.masc.mb.ca/masc.nsf/program_forages.html. The deadline to sign-up for 2020 forage insurance is March 31.   	- 30 -  	   "

In this case, the Manitoba government will partner with Shoppers Drug Mart and Pharmacists Manitoba on a smoking cessation social impact bond, beginning in April.  Under this model, Shoppers Drug Mart will invest $2 million over the next five years to fund activities around smoking cessation including counselling and nicotine replacement therapies.  Research shows these forms of treatment can increase the chances of long-term smoking cessation by up to 40 per cent, which in turn reduces hospital, medication and physician costs.   	The goal of the bond is to enrol up to 4,500 smokers over a three-year period based on their readiness to quit and to ensure a minimum of 12 per cent quit smoking with the support of one of more than 500 Manitoba pharmacists trained in smoking cessation.  Increasing the number of Manitobans who successfully quit smoking could save the province more than $1 million annually in lower health-care costs, Friesen said.   	Success metrics will focus on the number of people who participate in an initial assessment with a trained pharmacist, the number of people who have quit smoking for at least 12 months and the number of people who continue to abstain from nicotine after 24 months.  If outcomes are met or exceeded, the company will receive up to $2.12 million.   	“The health risks associated with smoking are among the costliest and the most preventable.  Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacists are trained to support patients through their journey, providing counsel and different approaches based on individual needs,” said Jeff Leger, president, Shoppers Drug Mart.  “We are confident in this new collaborative program and our ability to work with patients, the Manitoba government and Pharmacists Manitoba to help make our province healthier.”   	Anyone over the age of 18 is eligible for assistance and can approach participating pharmacies for an initial assessment.  The program will initially focus on health regions where smoking rates are highest – Northern (33 per cent), Interlake-Eastern (23 per cent) and Prairie Mountain (22 per cent).   	The provincewide smoking rate is 14.5 per cent, slightly below the Canadian average of 15.1 per cent.   	“Pharmacists work tirelessly every single day to make a difference in patients’ lives and this is another opportunity to demonstrate the positive contribution our members make to improved health care for Manitoba families,” said Pawandeep Sidhu, board president, Pharmacists Manitoba.  “A social impact bond dedicated to helping people quit smoking will positively impact countless Manitobans and we look forward to partnering with the government to implement the new program.”   	A 2015 report commissioned by Manitoba Health determined direct smoking-related illnesses cost the province’s health-care system approximately $244 million per year.   	This marks Manitoba’s second social impact bond.  Last year, the Manitoba government partnered with Southern First Nations Network of Care and Wiijii’idiwag Ikwewag, an Indigenous doula service provider, on a two-year pilot project designed to connect at-risk Indigenous mothers with doulas.   	- 30 -  	   "

Members of the youth council will report to the already-established independent Expert Advisory Council, which makes recommendations to the minister of conservation and climate on all aspects of the climate and green plan including the pillars of climate, jobs, water and nature.   	“The Expert Advisory Council looks forward to working with the newly established Youth Advisory Council.  Addressing climate change requires broad action across all economic sectors and collaboration among all Manitobans, businesses, academia and governments,” said Colleen Sklar, chair of the Expert Advisory Council.  “Hearing the voices of youth is essential as we collectively work to provide advice on delivering the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan.”   	The minister said the council will meet in early 2020 to begin its important work.  For more information on the Youth Advisory Council and the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan, visit www.gov.mb.ca/climateandgreenplan/index.html.    	- 30 -  "

The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), based in Winnipeg, has received an official request for additional assistance with the ongoing wildfire situation in Australia.  Canadian agencies have been quick to respond.  On Dec. 2, the first Canadian team left for approximately a one-month mission, and on Dec. 19, a second contingent of 30 highly qualified personnel from Wildland Fire Agencies across Canada left for a 31-day deployment to New South Wales.  A group of 17 firefighters were deployed to the state of Queensland on Dec. 30.   	The original 21-member team is preparing to return home and a fourth group of 21 Canadians will leave Jan. 4 to assist in New South Wales.  This latest group includes two staff from the Manitoba Wildfire Program, making a total of five Manitobans supporting the wildfire efforts in Australia.

Changes to the Maintenance Enforcement Program (MEP) came into effect in July 2019, allowing its staff to make more decisions and gather additional information related to child and spousal support without requiring a court order.  As a result, MEP will be able to review and adjust about 3,000 matters every year outside of the court system.  This is expected to save families an estimated $15 million annually in court and legal fees, the minister said.      	The Manitoba government has also made changes to allow decisions made by independent family arbitrators to be enforced in the same way as court orders, as of July 2019.  The arbitrator is chosen by family members involved to make decisions in a simpler, less formal process than if they were to go to court.  Arbitration decisions related to child support, spousal or common-law partner support can now be enforced by MEP and custody arrangements can be enforced under The Child Custody Enforcement Act.  Property-related decisions can also be enforced more quickly.   	A new web site launched today at www.manitoba.ca/familylaw/ will connect Manitobans with all of the public, private and community services and organizations that are currently available, alongside clear and accurate information about family law issues.  This online hub will help families complete the prerequisites to apply to court including:    		templates and guidelines to help parents develop their parenting arrangements including sharing parenting time and decision-making responsibilities;   		appropriate resources like arbitration, mediation and dispute resolution services to assist when they cannot resolve their disputes; and   		a tool to help families gather all of the financial disclosure information needed for child and spousal support as well as property division.    	Manitobans who do not have internet access or require additional assistance can call 204-945-2313 or 1-844-808-2313 (toll-free) or emailgetguidance@gov.mb.ca for a personalized response.   	The online hub also includes a public engagement report, which highlights how the province connected with service providers, stakeholders and Manitobans who have in the past, or are currently experiencing separation or divorce, gathering 250 ideas on how to improve the family law system.   	The minister noted the online hub and other resources will continue to be implemented to better support Manitoba families and their children, beginning in early 2020.   	Provincial officials will continue to speak with families who are sharing their experiences to help develop and improve family law services and supports.  This work will also continue to be guided by a collaboration table, a group created earlier this year to help guide the design and development of family law initiatives.  It includes family law service providers and experts from the legal, social service, financial, academic and non-governmental sectors.   	- 30 -  BACKGROUND INFORMATION ATTACHED  "
