GOVERNMENTS SUPPORT LOCAL COOKING INITIATIVE WITH MANITOBA ASSOCIATION OF HOME ECONOMISTS


	The governments of Canada and Manitoba will provide up to $70,000 to the Manitoba Association of Home Economists (MAHE) to provide resources for families to encourage cooking with low-cost, nutritious ingredients readily available in Manitoba, federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	 

	“From farm to table, ensuring that all Canadians have access to affordable and nutritious food is a priority for our government,” said Bibeau. “This project helps give Manitobans the tools and knowledge they need to make healthy meals for their families, while supporting our local food farmers. We will continue to work side-by-side with the province to help shape a healthier and more prosperous future for Manitoban families and communities.” 

	 

	“This project will help families to stretch their food budgets, while also increasing food security and resiliency in Manitoba,” said Pedersen. “Learning about food and how to prepare it is something families can do together, and these resources will help give them the information and confidence to make it a part of their daily lives. We are pleased to support an initiative that will encourage healthier diets and contribute to the overall health of our communities, building on the good work that is already happening in our province.”

	 

	Funding will be provided to the MAHE through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership to develop and promote printable electronic resources on food literacy and safe preparation of affordable and available food, with an emphasis on Manitoba-produced ingredients. MAHE will collaborate with community-based non-profits working with vulnerable populations, experts in public health and food safety, and the supply chain to ensure their work complements other existing resources and is accessible to Manitobans.   

	 

	“With the mission to improve the quality of life for individuals, families and communities, MAHE has the professional expertise and connections to fulfil this project’s mandate for the benefit of Manitobans,” said Sheila Stark-Perreault, MAHE president.

	 

	The five-year, $3-billion Canadian Agricultural Partnership includes $2 billion for cost-shared strategic initiatives delivered by the provinces and territories and $1 billion for federal programs and services. For more information, visit www.canada.ca/Agri-Partnership.

	 

	Pedersen noted the Manitoba government has also recently launched the Home Nutrition and Learning Program, which focuses on family-friendly recipes and educational activities. It includes a $2.5-million pilot program to help connect school-aged children and their families with nutritious foods to make together. For more information, visit www.manitoba.ca/nutritionlearningprogram. 

	 

	Pedersen also recognized the ongoing work of Manitoba’s commodity groups and other organizations that highlight the benefits of Manitoba’s locally grown and processed foods.

MANITOBA RELEASES LABOUR FORCE STATISTICS FOR JUNE
					  Increase in Employment Shows Positive Growth, Shows Manitoba Leading the Country in Student Employment:  Fielding


	The latest Labour Force Survey from Statistics Canada shows Manitoba leads the country in student employment and has recorded an increase of 28,900 in overall employment from May to June, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	 

	“Thanks to the efforts of all Manitobans and based on advice from our public health officials, we continued to move forward in our phased-in approach to restarting our economy and returning Manitobans to work in June,” said Fielding. “With increases in May and June, over 40 per cent of Manitobans who lost employment due to COVID-19 are already back at work.”

	 

	The province moved forward to Phase Two of Restoring Safe Services:  Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap for Recovery on June 1 and began Phase Three on June 21.

	 

	New Manitoba labour force statistics show the province fared better than the national average in key categories. Total June employment in Manitoba increased by 28,900, a 4.9 per cent increase from May, when employment increased by 13,100. The provincial labour force increased by 23,600 people in June.

	 

	Manitoba saw a significant 13.3 per cent increase in part-time jobs, up by 14,200. Full-time employment was up 14,800, a 3.1 per cent increase. 

	 

	Manitoba youth unemployment in particular decreased 3.5 percentage points to 19.3 per cent, the lowest in Canada. This reflects the focus the provincial government has placed on providing opportunities for students to find work. 

	 

	Overall, the provincial unemployment rate edged down to 10.1 per cent, the second lowest in the country and below Canada’s rate of 12.3 per cent. The private sector, which includes the self-employed, increased by 25,600, a 5.9 per cent gain from May to June. The national rate for the private sector increased by 6.9 per cent. 

	 

	The accommodation and food services sector, along with the wholesale and retail trade industry, saw the largest level changes from May to June.

	 

	“Manitoba is weathering the economic storm through our slow and safe plan to reopen businesses and restore services, and our job market continues to rebound for a second month,” said Fielding. “Our government continues to focus on programs that support employers and employees so even more Manitobans can get back to work.” 

	 

	To date, the Manitoba Gap Protection Program has provided approximately $44.6 million to more than 7,400 businesses that are ineligible for federal support. The Manitoba Back to Work This Summer Program has provided more than $3 million in supports so more than 220 private-sector employers could hire and re-hire 600 employees. The Summer Student Job Recovery Program has encouraged more than 1,800 employers to apply for $20 million in wage subsidies for more than 4,000 student positions.  

	 

	More than 1,600 people have applied for the Manitoba Job Restart Program to receive a $2,000 payment if they safely return to work and voluntarily stop collecting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or the Canada Emergency Student Benefit. 

	 

	The Manitoba Bureau of Statistics will publish its full June 2020 Labour Force Survey bulletin this afternoon at www.gov.mb.ca/mbs/reports/labour_force_statistics.html.

AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES UPDATE


	Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development reports adult zebra mussels have been found for the first time in Sipiwesk Lake, which is located north of Cross Lake and is part of the Nelson River. 

	 

	Zebra mussels were first discovered in the South Basin of Lake Winnipeg in 2013. It was expected they would move down the Nelson River naturally, so it was designated an aquatic invasive species (AIS) control zone in 2015 to help prevent the introduction and control the spread of zebra mussels and spiny waterflea.

	 

	Adult and veliger zebra mussels were first detected in the Nelson River in August 2019. Last fall, department officials contacted nearby communities and stakeholders to inform them of the discovery of zebra mussels, mostly in the larval stage, in the region.  

	 

	Zebra mussels can impair community drinking water systems and other industries that use water from affected water bodies. They can contaminate watercraft motors and shorelines. Zebra mussels also negatively affect commercial fishers, lodge operators and local tourism.

	 

	The spread of zebra mussels and other AIS is preventable. All surface water users such as boaters, fishers, beach goers and floatplane operators are reminded to do their part when entering and exiting all water bodies in Manitoba. Specific decontamination and bait requirements are in place within AIS control zones. The AIS open-water season checklist is a step-by-step resource that can help surface water-users comply with the Manitoba government’s AIS regulation.

	 

	Watercraft inspection stations are operating into the middle of fall. It is a legal requirement for all watercraft, which includes canoes, kayaks and jet skis, to stop at watercraft inspection stations when they are open. AIS requirements and set fines for offences are in effect year round.

	 

	For more information on invasive species, including the decontamination station schedule for aquatic invasive species, visit www.manitoba.ca/StopAIS.

PROVINCE ISSUES FLOOD WARNING FOR AREAS OF NORTHWEST MANITOBA
					  Updates High Water Situation in Southwest, Western and Southern Manitoba


	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre has issued a flood warning related to high water entering Manitoba from Saskatchewan and potential rises along the Churchill River. Mathias Colomb Cree Nation, Granville Lake and Leaf Rapids residents should be prepared for high water.

	 

	Saskatchewan Power is releasing record high flows from reservoirs along the Churchill River. The effects of this flow increase in Manitoba will be:

	• Pukatawagan Lake - Mathias Colomb Cree Nation

- Increased levels will be seen in three to five days, with peak levels in five to eight days.  At the peak, the level is expected to rise by five to seven feet.

	- The current lake level is 905.5 ft. and the peak forecast level is 910.5 to 912.5 ft.

	• Granville Lake

	- The increased release is expected in about two weeks, with the peak arriving within three to four weeks, rising by eight to 10 ft. 

	- The current lake level is 859 ft. with the peak expected to be 867 to 869 ft.

	• Leaf Rapids

	- The increased release is expected in about two weeks, with the peak within three to four weeks.  At the peak, the level is expected to rise by eight to 10 ft. 

	- The current lake level is 856.3 ft. with the peak level estimated at 864.3 to 866.3 ft.

	 

	Areas of southwest and western Manitoba continue to experience flood conditions following record-high precipitation of more than 200 millimetres. Southern Manitoba, including the United States portion of the Red River basin, also received significant precipitation during this time. The precipitation has caused water levels to rise in rivers and creeks in these areas.

	 

	Water levels at the provincial dam at Rivers on the Little Saskatchewan River have declined steadily as there has been no significant rain in the area. The levels are now closer to the 2014 high water event. 

	 

	The steady declines have allowed provincial crews to prepare material and equipment to start the process of assessing the condition of the dam at Rivers. 

	 

	The latest flow on the Little Saskatchewan River at Minnedosa is 1,540 cubic feet per second (cfs).  

	 

	The latest flow rate from the Rivers dam is approximately 3,900 cfs, receding from the 12,000 cfs peak flow observed July 1.

	 

	The dams at Rivers and Minnedosa are being monitored around the clock.

	 

	At present, 57 individuals remain evacuated from the RM of Riverdale, 17 remain evacuated from the RM of Whitehead while the town of Neepawa and the RM of Cornwallis evacuees have returned. In addition, livestock has been moved from the RMs of Riverdale and Whitehead.  

	 

	People are advised to stay away from areas experiencing flooding and to avoid entering flooded water bodies. Unless travel is necessary, the province requests that individuals stay away from affected areas.

	 

	Manitoba Infrastructure crews are working in the flood-affected areas. Staff are monitoring water level conditions and inspecting infrastructure on an ongoing basis, and 11 standard emergency response trailers have been deployed to the Westman area. These trailers contain pumps, water tubes and other essential flood equipment.

	 

	Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization staff are working with municipalities to support local emergency management efforts. If required, evacuee reception centres will have physical distancing measures in place.

	 

	A high water advisory has been issued for the Red River between Emerson and Winnipeg.

	 

	Water levels are rising on the Red River and its tributaries due to recent rain, but levels are expected to remain within banks.

PROVINCIAL HUNTING UPDATE AND MOOSE SURVEY RESULTS
					  Hunting Guide Now Online and Fall Hunting Licenses Available Soon:  Pedersen


Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba Hunting Guide 2020 is now available and online licensing for the fall hunting season will soon begin, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today. The minister noted results from three aerial surveys on moose population trends were also released today, as part of the government’s commitment to enhance the quality and transparency of big game population data for biologists and the public.

	 

	“Fall hunting is an important annual activity for many Manitobans as they spend time in our province’s great outdoors,” said Pedersen. “We are pleased to be making hunting licences and other outdoor recreation licences and permits more accessible and convenient with the move to e-licensing.”

	 

	Fall hunting licenses will be available in August on the new e-licensing system at www.manitobaelicensing.ca/licensing.page. Hunters should visit the site to set up their account, order game tags and purchase their license in advance of opening day, as they must allow two weeks for delivery of game tags. The site can also be used to search for vendors that sell licences. 

	 

	Print copies of the Manitoba Hunting Guide 2020 will start to become available at Manitoba Conservation and Climate offices and licence vendors in the coming weeks and the guide is now available at www.gov.mb.ca/sd/pubs/fish_wildlife/huntingguide.pdf. 

	 

	The province has made its 2020 aerial moose surveys available in a new, more user-friendly format. Aerial population surveys allow biologists to determine changes in population trend over time and evaluate changes in sex and age ratios. Aerial moose surveys were conducted in January and February in Game Hunting Areas (GHA) 13, 13A (Porcupine Mountain), 18, 18A-C (Duck Mountain) and 26 (Pinawa/Bisset area), and a summary of the recent results is available at http://gov.mb.ca/sd/pubs/fish_wildlife/hunting/2020biggame_results.pdf.

	 

	“Moose populations appear to be recovering in certain areas. However, the slow recovery suggests they are facing an uphill battle,” said Pedersen. “By sharing this information, we want to help user groups better understand the demands on these resources and inform the potential measures that may be needed to help keep moose populations healthy.”

	 

	The survey results suggest a gradual trend of increasing moose populations in Duck Mountain and GHA 26 since 2010 and a stable population in Porcupine Mountain. The trend over time suggests these populations are recovering, but more slowly than anticipated.

	 

	Moose hunting closures have been in place in the areas surveyed. However, the results show hunting is only one of several factors affecting populations. Good nutrition and habitat have positive effects on moose survival and reproduction, while other factors such as disease, parasites, predation and the harvest of cows have negative effects.

	 

	The minister noted the province is committed to implement shared management plans, based on listening, learning and working with stakeholders. This work will begin in partnership with user groups and communities later this year.

EDUCATION SAVINGS REDIRECTED TO MANITOBA CLASSROOMS
					  Millions of Dollars in Management and Other Savings to be Put Into Classroom Learning:  Goertzen


	Manitoba school divisions will have almost $48 million to cover unanticipated costs of the COVID-19 pandemic and to reopen classrooms in September after the suspension of classroom learning during the past school year, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	 

	“Our government’s goal is to focus school funding on classrooms to ensure Manitoba students can thrive and excel,” said Goertzen. “This is even more important as our province gradually emerges from the grip of COVID-19, and as we continue our plans to return to in-class teaching and learning this fall.” 

	 

	School divisions, along with Manitoba’s entire summary government, took steps to limit non-essential spending during the early days of the pandemic. Some of the funds saved were used to cover new costs for improvements to technology for remote learning and the remaining savings will go toward adapting to reopening classrooms in September as well as for public health measures that may be in place.

	 

	In addition, once fully implemented, more than $4 million per year will be redirected to classrooms after Manitoba school divisions identified this sum in annual savings as part of an executive management streamlining initiative across multiple public-sector organizations, Goertzen noted. 

	 

	The fiscal sustainability measures have involved executive compensation, management streamlining and staff efficiencies. School divisions were directed to reduce their executive and senior management complements by 15 per cent by Sept. 1.

	 

	“This is good news for students and parents as it will mean more spent on improving classroom learning,” said Goertzen. “The government measures ensure fiscal sustainability will make a positive impact on Manitoba schools and the education of students across the province.”

	 

	Medium-sized and large school divisions with more than four executive or senior management positions were expected to reduce their numbers of positions by 15 per cent, the minister said. Smaller school divisions, with fewer executive or senior management positions, were directed to reduce managerial salaries and operating costs by 15 per cent, he added.

PROVINCE CALLING FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR SOCIAL IMPACT BOND TO REDUCE YOUTH RECIDIVISM


	The Manitoba government is seeking a service provider to deliver a social impact bond that will help to reduce recidivism among youth and prevent further involvement with the justice system, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today. 

	 

	“Our government is committed to reducing the recidivism rates of youth as part of our Criminal Justice System Modernization and Policing and Public Safety strategies, and it’s clear a new, more effective approach is needed to deal with the issue,” said Cullen. “This social impact bond is an innovative way for us to work with the private sector and community groups to find new solutions to this pressing challenge.” 

	 

	A social impact bond is a social policy tool that brings together government, the private sector, not-for-profits and other stakeholders to deliver effective and prevention-focused solutions. Private investment is used to fund the programs initially, and then is repaid if social outcomes and cost savings are realized. These types of programs allow the government to explore more innovative solutions without financial risk, with the ultimate goal of delivering better outcomes for Manitobans.

	 

	In this case, the social impact bond is intended to reduce recidivism in youth between the ages of 12 to 18 who are currently involved with restorative justice, community supervision orders and/or are in custody. The resulting programming will use a holistic approach grounded in Indigenous traditions and knowledge, and will seek to include the youths’ natural and found families. The skills, education and mental health needs of youth will also be supported. 

	 

	The province will provide up to $460,000 for a site in Winnipeg and up to $230,000 for a site in Thompson for each of the three years of the project, inclusive of program and evaluation costs. 

	 

	The Manitoba government will select one or more service providers from among those that submit ideas and the successful proponent will work with the province to develop a business case to promote the project with potential investors. The minister noted the province will provide oversight, and the successful proponent will be expected to report regularly on implementation, progress and outcomes.

	 

	The request for expressions of interest has been posted on MERX at www.merx.com. The deadline for application is Aug. 10.

MANITOBA EXPANDING SERVICES FOR EATING DISORDER PROGRAM
					  Investments Support Services Closer to Home, Help Build Networks:  Friesen


Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is investing $1.1-million to expand eating disorder programs at Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg, as well as create a safe nutrition clinic for people living with eating disorders, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	 

	“Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia and binge-eating are the number one cause of death among all mental illnesses,” said Friesen. “This investment will decrease wait times for treatment and keep individuals close to their support networks in Manitoba, while receiving care.”

	 

	The minister noted the VIRGO report identified the need for additional eating disorder services in Manitoba. The investments will include:

	• increasing inpatients beds to five beds from three at Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg,

	• creating a safe nutrition clinic that provides meal supports for inpatients or those receiving care in the community,

	• expanding outpatient program capacity, and 

	• improving programming for co-existing eating disorder and substance use disorder patients.

	 

	“This government is committed to supporting Manitobans and their families struggling with eating disorders,” the minister said. “Today’s announcement will allow more Manitobans to access services that before could not be accessed due to excessive wait times for treatment.”

	 

	“The care and treatment of eating disorders requires a dedicated and specialized team that is able to intervene early and effectively with patients who require inpatient treatment and those whose care can be managed in the community,” said Dr. Louis Ludwig, medical director, Adult Eating Disorders Program at Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg. “This investment in additional inpatient beds and a new nutrition clinic are expected to shorten wait times for entry into our programs, reduce the length of stay for some inpatients and may eliminate the need for some patients to be admitted with these additional supports available on an outpatient basis.” 

	 

	This funding will reduce the wait times of inpatient care to one to two weeks from two to 10 weeks and outpatient care to two to three weeks from four to six months. The funding will also allow money previously allocated to send Manitobans out of province to be reinvested on supports in Manitoba. In the first six months of 2019, over $500,000 was spent on five patients to be sent out of province for care.

	 

	“Nearly one million Canadians live with a diagnosable eating disorder and millions more struggle with food and weight preoccupation,” said Elaine Stevenson, co-founder of the Alyssa Stevenson Eating Disorder Memorial Trust. “The initiatives announced today by this government will significantly address the urgent need for access to timely, comprehensive and specialized treatment.”

	 

	Today’s announcement is one in a series of the Manitoba government’s investments to meet better the needs of Manitobans struggling with mental health and addiction concerns.

	 

	“Since last fall, we have invested more than $38 million to improve access to mental health and addictions treatment and care,” said Friesen. “Today’s announcement supports those investments and will help us ensure we’re able to provide the right care, in the right place, at the right time for Manitobans.”

July  7, 2020
PROVINCE INCREASES PROTECTION OF NATURAL HABITATS IN TWO PROVINCIAL PARKS
					  Supports the Nature Pillar of Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan:  Guillemard


	The Manitoba government has changed land-use categories in Duck Mountain Provincial Park and Turtle Mountain Provincial Park, ensuring the protection and sustainability of 6,065 hectares of natural habitat and species in these areas, Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard announced today.

	 

	“Our government is committed to the protection and preservation of lands, parks and local ecosystems in Manitoba’s ecoregions,” said Guillemard. “In consultation with local residents, affected stakeholders and Indigenous communities, we are proud to make these changes that will enhance the protection of rare and at-risk species and habitat in our provincial parks.” 

	 

	In Duck Mountain Provincial Park, 951 hectares (ha) have changed from resource management to back-country land-use category, which will ensure the protection of rare plant species in that park. In Turtle Mountain Provincial Park, 5,114 ha have changed from recreational development, resource management and access to back-country land-use category. This change will help the moose population recover, the minister noted.

	 

	The increased protection afforded in the Turtle Mountain Provincial Park was made possible when Tundra Oil and Gas voluntarily ceased operations in the park and rehabilitated its lease sites.

	 

	“The partnership Tundra Oil and Gas has with the Turtle Mountain Provincial Park is a strong example of collaborative land-use restoration under a sustainable resource use model,” said Jane Mactaggart, president and chief executive officer, Tundra Oil and Gas. “Following our voluntary contribution of legacy land leases, Tundra’s oil and gas operations have been reclaimed and restored with a blend of native grasslands. The team at Tundra joins with our fellow Manitobans to celebrate the land-use change of this permanently protected ecosystem.”

	 

	Establishing new protected areas is a key goal of the nature pillar of the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan. Adding these lands to Manitoba’s network of protected and conserved areas has increased the area of the province set aside for biodiversity conservation to 11.1 per cent, the minister noted.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES $150 MILLION IN HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENTS AS PART OF MANITOBA RESTART PROGRAM
					  Investing in Highways Supports Economic Growth:  Schuler


	The Manitoba government is investing $150 million to resurface more than 240 kilometres of roadway, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	 

	“Our government is committed to improving Manitoba’s transportation infrastructure to ensure the safe and reliable flow of both people and goods,” said Schuler. “Investing in our highways supports economic growth and will have a positive impact on the province for years to come.”

	 

	Manitoba Infrastructure has identified 10 sections to resurface on the Trans-Canada Highway and Provincial Trunk Highways (PTH) 23 and 59. Resurfacing work will take place on the following sections of highway: 


		the Trans-Canada Highway eastbound lanes from Provincial Road (PR) 257 near Virden to the east junction at Oak Lake (29.5 km);

		the Trans-Canada Highway eastbound lanes from the east junction of PR 250 to the west junction of PTH 10 near Brandon (22.9 km);

		the Trans-Canada Highway eastbound lanes from the east junction of PTH 26 near St. François Xavier to Gaol Road near Headingley (six km);

		the Trans-Canada Highway westbound lanes from Gaol Road to the east junction of PTH 26 (six km);

		PTH 23 from PTH 59 to PTH 75 near Morris (29 km);

		PTH 23 from PTH 34 to PTH 5 west of Baldur (39.4 km);

		PTH 23 from PTH 5 to the west junction of PTH 18 near Ninette (25.3 km);

		PTH 23 from the west junction of PTH 18 to the south junction of PTH 10 near Minto (26.2 km);

		PTH 59 from the U.S. Border to PR 403 near St. Malo (40 km); and

		PTH 59 from PR 403 to PTH 52 (21 km).


	Some of the planned projects involve reconstruction, which includes grading or grade widening, removing the existing surface, restoring the road base and resurfacing multi-layered pavement. Work also includes major rehabilitation that involves a multi-layer pavement overlay to restore the pavement surface condition, extend pavement life and increase loading capacity. Other projects will involve single layer pavement overlays to improve pavement surface condition and extend pavement life.

	 

	Schuler said the province expects to begin work on some of the roadways this August.

	 

	“We have identified areas for reconstruction and major rehabilitation on three key highways in our province,” said Schuler. “We are making upgrades and performing maintenance on the Trans-Canada and highway 59 south, which are important routes for trade and tourism, and repairing damage on portions of highway 23 that occurred during the spring breakup to prevent further closures.” 

	 

	The road resurfacing funds come from the $500-million Manitoba Restart Program, an economic stimulus package announced in May to help restart Manitoba’s economy and ramp up construction as the province moves forward through the COVID-19 pandemic. The province will announce further projects funded under the Manitoba Restart Program in the coming weeks.

PROVINCE UPDATES HIGH WATER SITUATION IN SOUTHWEST, WESTERN AND SOUTHERN MANITOBA
					  High Water Advisory Issued for Red River Between Emerson and Winnipeg


	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is issuing an update on the flood warning and high water advisory situation in southwest, western and southern Manitoba.

	 

	Over the past week areas of southwest and western Manitoba have received record-high precipitation of more than 200 millimetres during this period. Southern Manitoba, including the United States portion of the Red River basin, has also received significant precipitation during this time. The precipitation has caused water levels to rise in rivers and creeks in these areas.

	 

	Water levels at the provincial dam at Rivers on the Little Saskatchewan River remain at historic high, even though levels have been declining on average one to 1.5 feet per day from the peak level recorded on July 1. The latest flow rate from the dam is approximately 6,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), receding from the 12,000 cfs peak flow observed on July 1. The dam continues to be monitored around the clock.

	 

	At present, 82 individuals have been evacuated from the RM of Riverdale, four from the RM of Cornwallis, 16 from the RM of Whitehead and three from the town of Neepawa. In addition, livestock has also been moved from the RMs of Riverdale and Whitehead.  

	 

	A moderate amount of rain, near 30 mm, was recorded in the past 24 hours in southwest portion of the province, with about 15 to 30 mm rain recorded in the Little Saskatchewan River basin. The rain will slow down the recession or increase the levels slightly as the river flows past Minnedosa, Rapid City and Rivers onto the Assiniboine River.

	 

	People are advised to stay away from areas experiencing flooding and do not attempt to enter flooded water bodies. Unless travel is necessary, the province requests that individuals stay away from affected areas.

	 

	Manitoba Infrastructure crews are working in the flood-affected areas. Staff are monitoring water level conditions and inspecting infrastructure on an ongoing basis, and 11 standard emergency response trailers have been deployed to the Westman area. These trailers contain pumps, water tubes and other essential flood equipment.

	 

	Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization staff are working with municipalities to support local emergency management efforts. If required, evacuee reception centres will have physical distancing measures in place.

	 

	A high water advisory is issued for the Red River between Emerson and Winnipeg.

	 

	Water levels are rising on the Red and tributaries due to the recent rain events. Levels will continue to rise along the Red River as moderate precipitation is forecast at most locations in southern Manitoba including the Red River basin in the next four to six days. Levels are expected to remain within banks.

PROVINCE UPDATES HIGH WATER SITUATION IN SOUTHWEST AND WESTERN MANITOBA


	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is issuing an update on the flood warning and high water advisory situation in southwest and western Manitoba.

	 

	Over the past week, a weather system brought significant precipitation to southwest and western Manitoba. Some areas have received record-high precipitation of more than 200 millimetres during this period. The precipitation has caused water levels to rise in rivers and creeks in these areas.

	 

	Widespread precipitation is forecast for most southern, southwest and southeast Manitoba watersheds for the next five to seven days. Occasional heavy thunderstorms could develop at these locations during this time and could bring up to 100 mm of heavy localized rain, which could lead to localized overland flooding. 

	 

	Property owners are advised to take precautions as water levels could rise significantly in a short time in these areas. Unless travel is necessary, the province requests that individuals stay away from affected areas.

	 

	Manitoba Infrastructure crews are working in the flood-affected areas. Staff are monitoring water level conditions and inspecting infrastructure on an ongoing basis, and 11 standard emergency response trailers have been deployed to the Westman area. These trailers contain pumps, water tubes and other essential flood equipment.

	 

	On July 1, based on engineering assessments and out of an abundance of caution, the province of Manitoba announced it had lost confidence in the integrity of the dam near Rivers. It recommended the evacuation of people and livestock from approximately 30 to 40 properties along the Little Saskatchewan River downstream of the dam in the rural municipalities of Riverdale and Whitehead. At present, 80 individuals have been evacuated from the RM of Riverdale, four from the RM of Cornwallis, 17 from the RM of Whitehead and three from the town of Neepawa. In addition, livestock has also been evacuated from the RM of Riverdale and the RM of Whitehead. 

	 

	Manitoba Infrastructure also recommended the immediate suspension of all use of Lake Wahtopanah.

	 

	The dam at Rivers is facing a one-in-1,000-year flood event and unprecedented flows on the Little Saskatchewan River following heavy rains and Manitoba Infrastructure indicated there is potential for a structural failure. The dam at Rivers remains intact, but flows are at record levels. Flows at the dam are currently 8,500 cubic feet per second (cfs), a decrease from 12,000 cfs earlier this week.

	 

	Manitoba Infrastructure will be monitoring the dam 24-7 until water levels subside. Minor repairs are being completed on an ongoing and as needed basis. 

	 

	The water level on Lake Wahtopanah has declined 1.5 feet over the past 24 hours and continues to decline but is still at historically high levels.

	 

	A flood warning remains in place for the Little Saskatchewan River and Whitemud River watersheds. Both rivers are above flood stage and low-lying land near the rivers are affected. 

	 

	High water levels on the Whitemud River and are affecting areas near Arden and Gladstone. Levels have peaked at most locations and have started declining, except at Westbourne where water is still rising. The Whitemud River at Westbourne is expected to peak in the next 24 to 48 hours and water is expected to stay within the banks. 

	 

	A flood warning also remains in place for the Assiniboine River from Brandon to Portage la Prairie.

	 

	Overland flooding is being reported in areas across the Assiniboine River watershed. Flooding of low-lying areas is expected for most portions of the Assiniboine River between Brandon and Portage la Prairie. However, water is expected to remain below flood protection levels at most locations along the Assiniboine River.

	 

	Operation of the Portage Diversion began yesterday to limit flows in the lower Assiniboine River to 10,000 cfs. The level of Lake Manitoba is currently 811.5 ft., which is in the middle of the desired water level range. The operation of the Portage Diversion is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the level of Lake Manitoba. This operation is in accordance with Portage Diversion operating guidelines. The flow on the Portage Diversion is approximately 700 cfs and the flow on the Lower Assiniboine River near Portage la Prairie is approximately 10,000 cfs. The flow on the diversion should increase to 3,000 cfs over the next 24 hours.

	 

	Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization (EMO) staff are working with municipalities to support local emergency preparedness efforts. If required, evacuee reception centres will have physical distancing measures in place.

PROVINCE ISSUES UPDATED FLOOD WARNING AND HIGH WATER ADVISORY


	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is issuing an updated flood warning and high water advisory for southwest and western Manitoba.

	 

	On July 1, based on engineering assessments and out of an abundance of caution, the Province of Manitoba lost confidence in the dam near Rivers and recommended the evacuation of people and livestock from approximately 30 to 40 properties along the Little Saskatchewan River, downstream of the dam, in the rural municipalities of Riverdale and Whitehead. Manitoba Infrastructure is recommending that all use of Lake Wahtopanah be suspended immediately.

	 

	The dam is facing unprecedented flows on the Little Saskatchewan River following heavy rains and Manitoba Infrastructure has indicated there is potential for a structural failure. 

	 

	The recommended evacuation comes as a weather system has brought significant precipitation in the past week in southwest and western Manitoba. Some areas have received record-high precipitation of more than 200 millimetres during this period. The precipitation has caused water levels to rise in rivers and creeks in these areas.

	 

	If required, evacuee reception centres will have social distancing measures in place.

	 

	Overland flooding is being reported in areas across the Assiniboine River watershed. A number of rivers, including the Little Saskatchewan River, are above flood stage and low-lying land near the river is affected.

	 

	Flooding of low-lying areas is expected for most portions of the Assiniboine River and its tributaries. However, water is expected to remain below flood protection levels at most locations along the Assiniboine and Souris rivers. 

	 

	A flood warning has been issued for the Whitemud River as the run-off from upstream watersheds is passing through the Arden and Gladstone areas. Water could rise above bank levels within a short period in the Whitemud River watershed. Projected flows will be in excess of the peak flow during the 2011 flood event.

PROVINCE ISSUES REQUEST TO ADDRESS SURGERY BACKLOG
					  Plan to Catch Up on Delayed Surgeries Due to COVID-19:  Friesen


	The Manitoba government is issuing a request for proposals to complete elective surgeries postponed due to COVID-19, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	 

	“COVID-19 placed a lot of people’s procedures on hold and it has been a difficult time while they wait for their surgery to be rescheduled. We thank Manitobans for their patience during this time,” said Friesen. “This government is looking for innovative solutions to address the backlog of surgeries created by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we believe this plan will get people the care they need, as quickly and efficiently as possible.”

	 

	The proposals, which can be submitted by both public and private facilities, must present details on how the applicant will be able to address priority surgical and diagnostic areas by creating additional capacity in the system. 

	 

	“The Manitoba government already works with a number of providers outside the public system to provide services, including cataract surgeries, and other surgical and diagnostic procedures,” said Friesen. “This government believes Manitobans deserve better health care, sooner. This initiative demonstrates that we are committed to exploring all available options to get surgeries and procedures rescheduled so that Manitobans have access to the care they need now, while the risk of COVID-19 is lower.”

	 

	Priority areas include, but are not limited to:

	• pediatric dental surgeries;

	• pediatric ear, nose and throat surgeries;

	• minor orthopedic procedures;

	• ophthalmology surgery;

	• outpatient spine procedures; and

	• outpatient urology surgeries. 

	 

	Services must be able to be delivered beginning Aug. 1. 

	 

	The proposals must also consider and identify how services can be provided by meeting all required legislative, regulatory and standards requirements including regulatory body licensure requirements for health providers. In addition, the proposals must not affect existing service delivery capacity in the public system.

	 

	The health-care system paused elective surgeries in late March to ensure there was capacity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic if case numbers continued to increase. Surgical volumes were reduced by approximately 7,000 procedures. In late April, elective surgeries resumed as case numbers fell and surgical volumes reached 90 per cent of normal levels by early June. At that time, there were approximately 5,500 people still waiting to have their surgery rescheduled. 

	 

	The minister noted this is similar to a process that was arranged in British Columbia. 

	 

	The request is posted to MERX at www.merx.com under an open tendering process.

PROVINCE RECOMMENDING EVACUATION OF PEOPLE AND LIVESTOCK  FROM SPECIFIC PROPERTIES DOWNSTREAM OF RIVERS DAM


	Based on engineering assessments, and out of an abundance of caution, Manitoba Infrastructure is recommending an evacuation of people and livestock from approximately 30 to 40 properties along the Little Saskatchewan River downstream of the Rivers Dam in the rural municipalities of Riverdale and Whitehead.

	 

	The Manitoba government does not have confidence in the Rivers Dam. The dam is facing unprecedented flows on the Little Saskatchewan River following heavy rains over the past few days, and provincial and consulting engineers have indicated there is potential for a structural failure. 

	 

	The municipalities of Riverdale, Whitehead and Cornwallis and the City of Brandon have been notified. Municipal officials are working with the province to ensure residents downstream of the dam are aware of the situation and have destinations in mind if asked to evacuate as a precaution.

	 

	Manitoba Infrastructure is also recommending that all use of Lake Wahtopanah be suspended immediately.

	 

	The recommended evacuation comes as a weather system has brought significant precipitation in the past 72 hours in southwest and western Manitoba. Some areas have received record-high precipitation of more than 200 millimetres during this period. The precipitation has caused water levels to rise in rivers and creeks in these areas.

	 

	Overland flooding is being reported in areas across the Assiniboine River watershed. A number of rivers, including the Little Saskatchewan River, are above flood stage and low-lying land near the river is affected.

	 

	Flooding of low-lying areas is expected for most portions of the Assiniboine River and its tributaries. However, water is expected to remain below flood protection levels at most locations along the Assiniboine and Souris rivers. 

	 

	A flood warning has been issued for the Whitemud River as the run-off from upstream watersheds is passing through the Arden and Gladstone areas. Water could rise above bank-full levels within a short period in the Whitemud River watershed.

	 

	A flood warning remains in place for the Little Saskatchewan River and Whitemud River watersheds. 

	 

	As well, a high water advisory remains in place for the Spruce Woods Provincial Park area.

	 

	Operation of the Portage Diversion could begin within the next 48 hours to limit flows in the lower Assiniboine River to 10,000 cubic feet per second. The level of Lake Manitoba is currently 811.5 feet, which is in the middle of the desired water level range. The operation of the Portage Diversion is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the level of Lake Manitoba. This operation is in accordance with Portage Diversion operating guidelines. 

	 

	Manitoba Infrastructure crews are working in the flood-affected areas.  Staff are monitoring water level conditions and inspecting infrastructure on an ongoing basis.

PROVINCE ISSUES FLOOD WARNING AND HIGH WATER ADVISORY


	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is issuing an updated flood warning and high water advisory for southwest and western Manitoba.

	 

	A weather system passing through Manitoba watersheds has brought significant precipitation in the past 48 hours, and has caused water levels to rise in rivers and creeks.

	 

	Another moderate precipitation system is in the forecast and could bring an additional 30 to 80 millimetres of rain in southwest and western Manitoba, and in eastern Saskatchewan over the next 24 hours. The Assiniboine, Qu’Appelle, Souris rivers and their tributaries could be affected.

	 

	Overland flooding is being reported from areas across the Assiniboine River watershed. A number of smaller rivers, including the Little Saskatchewan River, are above flood stage and low-lying land near the river is affected. The forecast precipitation may exacerbate the flooding in these areas and could create more overland flooding in southwest and western Manitoba. 

	 

	Flooding of low-lying areas is expected for most portions of the Assiniboine River and its tributaries. However, water is expected to remain below flood protection levels at most locations along the Assiniboine and Souris rivers.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT RELEASES FEEDBACK ON PHASE THREE OF COVID-19 REOPENING, SCHOOL RESTART PLANS


	The Manitoba government is releasing data on public feedback to Phase Three of the province’s Restoring Safe Services roadmap to economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and on surveys completed by parents and students on its school re-entry plan, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen and Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	 

	“We asked Manitobans how they feel about our government’s plan to further reopen the economy, and thousands of people took the time to complete the survey,” said Friesen. “I thank Manitobans for taking part and providing their thoughts on how we can keep people across our province safe, while taking steps to return to a new normal.” 

	 

	On June 11, the Manitoba government introduced a preliminary draft of the third phase of the Restoring Safe Services plan to further ease public health measures put in place to address the COVID-19 pandemic. 

	 

	Between June 11 and June 21, 5,379 people provided feedback on the plan. The top five areas of interest included education and the post-secondary sector, health care, the public service, child care and the recreation, culture and tourism sector. 

	 

	The survey showed that 67 per cent of respondents somewhat or definitely agreed that increasing public gathering sizes should be a priority. In addition, 62 per cent somewhat or definitely agreed that restrictions should be eased to allow inter-provincial travel from areas such as Saskatchewan and northwestern Ontario. 

	 

	Detailed survey results are available at https://gov.mb.ca/asset_library/en/proactive/2020_2021/phase_three_restoring_safe_services_survey.pdf. 

	 

	The surveys of students and parents on the school re-entry plan were launched on June 12 and were open for feedback until June 21. Approximately 7,000 student submissions and 30,538 parent submissions were received. 

	 

	“Thousands of Manitoba families told us how they are doing with the changes to schools and what they envision for a return to classrooms in the fall,” said Goertzen. “I thank everyone for taking the time to share their views and for helping the province develop a strong plan that will keep students, teachers and staff safe when they go back to class.” 

	 

	According to the survey, 84 per cent of students said they are doing OK or very well adjusting to physical distancing measures for COVID-19. In addition, 75 per cent of parents who took the survey said they are somewhat or very comfortable with the possibility of their children going back to in-class instruction in September.

PROVINCE PROVIDES ECONOMIC AND FISCAL UPDATE ASSESSING IMPACT OF COVID-19 IN MANITOBA
					  Manitoba Faces Unprecedented Fiscal Challenges, Must Restart Our Economy:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is releasing its economic and fiscal update assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, citing an expected deficit for 2020-21 in the range of $2.9 billion, with a downside risk of a deficit of up to $5 billion in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or a COVID comeback, Premier Brian Pallister and Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today. 

	 

	“The COVID-19 pandemic generated unprecedented public health and economic impacts in our province, which continue to be magnified by the global nature of this crisis,” said Pallister. “Growing our way out of this pandemic financial hole is the only way forward, which is why our government is focused on getting Manitobans back to work, and restarting our economy.”

	 

	The province is investing $2.1 billion to fight COVID and restart the economy, which is the second-highest proportion of spending of any province as a percentage of GDP. That spending is targeted as follows: 

	• protecting Manitobans – $932 million;

	• protecting livelihoods – $477 million; and

	• restarting the economy – $774 million.

	 

	Manitoba Finance is planning for three economic scenarios:  a quick economic rebound or ‘V’, a gradual economic rebound or ‘U’, and a long, limited recovery or ‘L’.

	 

	Under the ‘V’ impact scenario, the 2020-21 summary net debt is projected to exceed $29 billion with a net debt to GDP ratio at nearly 41 per cent. This is up from 34.2 per cent forecast in Budget 2020. Higher interest costs alone on this new debt amounts to $70 million more per year, which is equal to building three new schools each and every year going forward, Fielding added.

	 

	“Thanks to the government’s effective fiscal management and targeted investments in emergency preparedness prior to the pandemic, Manitoba was better prepared to face this crisis,” said Fielding. “However, the impacts of COVID-19 will take several years to address, and should we have a COVID comeback and the global economy fails to grow, we will wind up with higher projected deficit and debt levels.”

	 

	Manitoba’s economy is expected to decline by approximately five per cent this year with an expected loss of revenues in the range of $1.5 billion this year and over $1 billion next year. With additional unanticipated spending underway to combat COVID this year, a rapid restart to the economy will be required or the province’s financial problems will deteriorate further, the minister noted.

	 

	Manitoba’s road to recovery will focus on two strategies:  continued investments in public health preparedness and increased investment in jobs and growth, the premier added.

	 

	“There is only one way out of the global economic and public health crisis, and that is to keep our COVID curve flat and grow our economy,” said Pallister. “Beating COVID creates jobs.”

PROVINCE INVESTS IN OVER 7,000 STUDENT JOBS TO SUPPORT MANITOBA'S COVID-19 RECOVERY
					  Manitobans Encouraged to Embrace Available Jobs as Economy Restarts:  Pallister


	The Manitoba government has facilitated the creation of more than 7,100 student jobs this summer as part of the province’s COVID-19 response and recovery efforts, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“Thanks to the hard work of all Manitobans, and early and decisive action, Manitoba is one of the safest places in the world from COVID-19, and one of the safest places to get back to work,” said Pallister. “Throughout this pandemic, we have been investing in solutions, and the solution in Manitoba is to get as many Manitobans as possible back to work as we reopen our province and restart our economy.”

	 

	Engaging students in work provides them with experience and opportunities to become inspired to follow career paths. Students bring real value to employers, including fresh perspectives and additional hands on deck as businesses adjust their operations to follow public health orders such as sanitization protocols and physical distancing measures, the premier noted.

	 

	The Summer Student Recovery Jobs Program provides a wage subsidy to businesses, charities and non-profit organizations for up to five student employees, for a total of $25,000. To date, more than 1,700 businesses have applied for support for over 3,815 student positions, for a total of over $19 million in financial assistance. The $10-million Green Team initiative has supported 1,860 student jobs within nearly 800 organizations across the province. 

	 

	The province also runs the Student Temporary Employment Program, which is expected to become one of the most robust student hiring initiatives within core government in Manitoba’s history, the premier added. 

	 

	“We have developed some of the most generous support programs in the country to help Manitobans bounce back from this unprecedented time,” said Pallister. “I encourage all Manitobans to take advantage of these initiatives and the job opportunities available as we restart our economy together.”

PROVINCE ISSUES FLOOD WARNING AND HIGH WATER ADVISORY


	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is issuing a flood warning and high water advisory for the southwest, western and central regions of Manitoba.

	A weather system passing through Manitoba watersheds has brought significant precipitation in the past 24 hours. The Assiniboine River watershed, including areas near Brandon and Minnedosa, has recorded close to 155 millimetres of precipitation in the past 24 hours.

	Another forecast weather system could bring an additional 80 to 150 mm of precipitation in southwest and western Manitoba, and in eastern Saskatchewan over the next 48 hours. The Assiniboine, Qu’Appelle and Souris rivers and their tributaries could be affected.

	Overland flooding is being reported from areas across the Assiniboine River watershed. A number of smaller rivers, including the Little Saskatchewan River, are above flood stage and low-lying land near the river is affected. The forecast precipitation could create more overland flooding in southwest and western Manitoba.

	Flooding of low-lying areas is expected for most portions of the Assiniboine River and its tributaries. However, water levels are expected to remain below flood protection levels at most locations along the Assiniboine and Souris rivers.

	Operation of the Portage Diversion may be required later this week to limit flows in the lower Assiniboine River to 10,000 cubic feet per second.

	The Shellmouth Reservoir is expected to handle the potential inflow increase due to the forecast precipitation system. 

	Property owners are advised to take precautions as water levels could quickly rise significantly in these areas.

PROVINCE ISSUES EXTENDED HEAT WARNING


	 

	Public health officials with Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living are issuing an extended heat warning for southern and central regions of the province.

	 

	Environment and Climate Change Canada is forecasting high temperatures in Manitoba for the next week. This system will bring hot conditions to southern and central Manitoba, with some areas experiencing extreme heat for three or four days.

	 

	Everyone is at risk for the effects of heat. However, during a period of prolonged heat, older adults, people with chronic illness and people living alone have a particularly high risk for heat illness, especially if they are living in an urban area or do not have air conditioning. Others at greater health risks to heat include infants and young children, and people who work or exercise in the heat.

	 

	Take care of yourself and others. Check in regularly with vulnerable or socially isolated community members, friends and family. Contact people by phone where possible to reduce face-to-face interactions, which will help control the spread of COVID-19.

	 

	Never leave people or pets alone in a parked vehicle or direct sunlight.

	 

	Certain substances, including amphetamines, MDMA (ecstasy), cocaine, alcohol and cannabis can alter mental status as well as increase the risk of over-heating. Some medications can also increase risk, so it is important to ask doctors or pharmacists whether prescribed medication affects the ability to cope with heat.

	 

	If someone has many of the following symptoms, their body may be overheating and at risk of heat illness or heat stroke:

	• headache;

	• red, hot and dry skin;

	• dizziness;

	• confusion;

	• nausea;

	• rapid weak pulse; and 

	• a complete or partial loss of consciousness.

	 

	The longer a person’s body temperature is above 40 C (105 F), the greater the likelihood of permanent effects or death. If these symptoms occur, immediately move to a cool place and drink water.

	 

	Emergency medical care may be needed depending on the severity of symptoms. If someone has a high body temperature, is unconscious or is confused, call for help. While waiting, cool the person right away by moving them to a cool place, apply cold water to large areas of the skin or clothing, and fan the person as much as possible.

	 

	Heat illnesses are preventable. The health effects of heat can be reduced by:

	• drinking plenty of liquids, especially water, before feeling thirsty;

	• wearing loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing and a wide-brimmed hat;

	• planning outdoor activities during cooler times of the day;

	• limiting alcohol consumption;

	• avoiding sun exposure and considering cancelling or rescheduling outdoor activities;

	• going to a cool place such as a mall, community centre, public library or place of worship, after checking the hours these sites are open under COVID-19 restrictions;

	• taking a cool shower or bath; and

	• blocking sun out by closing awnings, curtains or blinds during the day.

	 

	Regularly updated weather forecasts are available from Environment and Climate Change Canada at https://weather.gc.ca/canada_e.html.

	 

	For more information on heat and health, call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) 1-888-315-9257, or visit:

	The Manitoba government is investing more than $358 million in capital projects throughout the province to ensure Manitobans have safe, reliable care at Manitoba’s health-care facilities for years to come, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	 

	“Our government is undertaking the most significant transformation to the Manitoba health-care system in 40 years,” said Friesen. “These investments continue with that generational change, creating an impact that will not just be felt today, but decades from now.”

	 

	The investment will be: 

	• $280 million to safety upgrades to personal care homes,

	• $46 million to digital health initiatives, and 

	• $32 million to equipment and infrastructure upgrades at health-care facilities.

	 

	A request for proposals and public tenders for construction will be sent out for these investments. 

	 

	The safety and capital upgrades at personal care homes are intended to build on the government’s commitment to ensure health-care facilities are in line with revised Manitoba Fire Code requirements including provision of fire suppression systems and increased fire separation enhancements to better protect residents, staff and the public.

	 

	The eHealth initiatives will include upgrading the provincial electronic health record system, eChart Manitoba. There will also various other projects such as replacing voice recognition systems used for dictation and transcription, and upgrading critical hardware and software used across the health-care system, 

	 

	Each year, the regional health authorities, CancerCare Manitoba, Shared Health and the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba submit requests for safety and security projects at sites across the province. This year, the province is providing more than $17.4 million for 85 projects expected to cost less than $500,000 each. 

	 

	In addition, a further $15.3 million will be invested in replacement equipment in each of the regional health authorities and for diagnostic services provided through Shared Health Manitoba. More than 150 pieces of equipment will be purchased and installed including equipment for microbiology and virology, gastroscopes, endoscopes, colonoscopes, anesthetic machines, fetal and cardiac monitors, surgical tables and instruments, newborn bed warmers, hypothermia heating units, stress exercise equipment and bladder scanners. 

	 

	Specific cost estimates are not being released, as they are subject to the tendering process, the minister noted. He added the construction work will begin once the projects are publicly tendered and a contract awarded.

	 

	Provincial funding is provided to health facilities and regional health authorities for new construction and ongoing maintenance. This includes many multi-year projects from across the health-care system including safety and security projects, specialized equipment purchases and installation, information communication and technology projects, and major infrastructure investments.

SUPPORTING THE GROWTH OF WESTERN CANADIAN BUSINESS


	VICTORIA – A new online service simplifies the registration process across provincial lines, making it easier for owners to grow their business.

	 

	Until now, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba had separate processes and systems for corporations and limited partnerships to complete their extra-provincial business registrations and maintenance filings. On June 27, 2020, the four provinces were the first to implement the online Multi-jurisdictional Registry Access Service (MRAS), a hub that allows corporate information sharing between the provinces, making extra-provincial registration faster and easier.  

	 

	“People using this new service will find it easier to register their business in multiple provinces, and efficiently complete necessary paperwork through one central hub,” said Anne Kang, B.C.’s Minister of Citizens’ Services. “This joint effort under the New West Partnership Agreement streamlines trade between our provinces and opens up the possibility of including other provinces and territories in the future.” 

	 

	As members of the New West Partnership Trade Agreement, the four western provinces committed to reconciling business registration and reporting requirements between the jurisdictions, thus simplifying extra-provincial business registration processes. 

	 

	“The launch of this online service is just one of the ways we are cutting red tape for businesses, which is especially important as we relaunch our economy. MRAS is convenient and efficient, and makes it easier for Alberta job creators to expand their operations across western Canada and for western Canadian job creators to grow into Alberta,” said Nate Glubish, Alberta’s Minister for Service Alberta.

	 

	Through MRAS, other jurisdictions will eventually be able to share corporate information, thus extending the New West Partnership’s efficiencies across Canada. 

	 

	“We are always pleased to reduce red tape and make it easier for businesses to register and set up operations in Saskatchewan and Western Canada,” said Don Morgan, Saskatchewan’s Minister of Justice and Attorney General. 

	 

	“Manitoba is eager to work with our western neighbours under the New West Partnership Agreement and find ways to make life easier for business owners,” said Scott Fielding, Manitoba’s Minister of Finance. “A priority for our government is to reduce red tape and this is another way we are able to do so and improve economic trade across Western Canada.”

	 

	“We are pleased to see the western provinces move ahead with the Multi-jurisdictional Registry Access Service and reduce the regulatory burden on businesses who operate within different provinces. Today’s announcement is one step in the right direction on creating a more open interprovincial trade environment in Canada. It is encouraging to see these provinces move on this key recommendation CFIB made to the Canada Free Trade Agreement,” said Marilyn Braun-Pollon, CFIB’s vice-president, Western Canada & Agri-business. 

	 

Quick Facts:

	• MRAS allows jurisdictions to share corporate information so corporations and limited partnerships can complete and update their extra-provincial registration online. 

	• MRAS also includes a national corporate registry search tool, which provides core registration information for corporations and extra-provincial corporations.

	• At this time, MRAS is not available for limited liability partnerships and co-operatives. These filings will continue to be completed through the current model.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES NEW INTERCHANGE AT ST. MARY'S ROAD AND SOUTH PERIMETER HIGHWAY
					  Improvements Planned to Improve Safety and Traffic Flow Along Major Economic Corridor:  Schuler

Watch news conference





	As part of the $500-million Manitoba Restart Program, the province is planning to construct a new interchange to improve safety and the flow of traffic at the intersection of Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 100 and St. Mary’s Road, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	 

	“As part of the Trans-Canada Highway, the South Perimeter Highway is one of Manitoba’s most important trade corridors and plays a strategic role as it also connects with PTH 75, our major route to the United States,” said Schuler. “A new interchange will improve reliability and efficiency of Canada’s international and inter-provincial trade flows and support the growth of our economy.”

	 

	PTH 100 (South Perimeter Highway) and St. Mary’s Road is an at-grade intersection with traffic signals. The minister noted the intersection currently leads to high levels of traffic congestion during peak hours and has a high rate of vehicle collisions.

	 

	“The safety of the South Perimeter Highway has been a priority of our government, and these improvements will build on the measures we’ve taken over the past few years to create a safer and more efficient roadway for the approximately 30,000 vehicles that use it daily,” said Schuler. “With residential, commercial and industrial growth in south Winnipeg and communities south of the city, it is time to build the South Perimeter Highway to a freeway standard.”

	 

	In 2018, the province developed a South Perimeter Highway Safety Plan, which included closing some uncontrolled access points and median openings. It also launched a long-term South Perimeter Highway design study to reconstruct PTH 100 to a freeway standard with no at-grade crossings from the Trans-Canada Highway West interchange at Portage Avenue to the Trans-Canada Highway East interchange at Fermor Avenue. Intersecting roadways and railways would be separated through interchanges and overpasses. The province held public consultation and expects to complete its study this summer, the minister noted.

	 

	Schuler added the design study recommends an interchange at PTH 100 and St. Mary’s Road, and construction is expected to begin in 2021.

	 

	Funding for the St. Mary’s Road interchange is part of the $500-million Manitoba Restart Program, an economic stimulus package to help restart Manitoba’s economy and ramp up construction in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The province has included $65 million for major highway projects, including the PTH 100 and St. Mary’s Road interchange. Further projects funded under the Manitoba Restart Program will be announced in the coming weeks.

June 28, 2020

	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is issuing a flood watch and high water advisory for the southwestern, western and central regions of Manitoba.

	A weather system may release 75 to 100 millimetres of rain in these areas in the next three to four days, starting this afternoon. Areas in the southwest of Manitoba, including Virden and Brandon, could see up to 175 millimetres of rain during this time.

	There is the potential for overland flooding of low-lying areas and small streams and creeks due to the forecasted rain system. Most major rivers, including the Assiniboine and Souris rivers, are expected to remain within their banks at most locations.

	Property owners are advised to take precautions as water levels could rise significantly in short time periods in these areas.

He also serves on the board of St. Boniface Hospital and Abri Marguerite.

	 

	The Francophone Affairs Advisory Council provides advice and recommendations to the minister on ways to develop and enrich Manitoba’s francophone community.  

	 

	The Francophone Affairs Advisory Council was created under the Francophone Community Enhancement and Support Act. The act establishes a framework to promote the vitality of the francophone community in Manitoba and to support its development through the activities of the Francophone Affairs Secretariat.

	 

	Squires noted these appointments are part of the Manitoba government’s efforts to refresh agencies, boards and commissions to ensure Manitobans continue to be represented in these important positions by highly qualified and enthusiastic individuals.

BEACH CONDITIONS TO JUNE 25


	Water quality testing by Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development has shown that levels of escherichia coli (E. coli) were within recreational water quality objectives at all beaches monitored this week.

	 

	Visitors are advised to avoid swallowing lake water, wash hands before handling food and avoid swimming with an open cut or wound, or while experiencing illness. Visitors to Lake Winnipeg should minimize water contact if lake levels are high and strong winds are blowing from the north. Research shows E. coli counts tend to be elevated during these conditions as they are washed out of the wet beach sand and into the swimming area. 

	 

	This week, algal blooms were sampled at Pelican Lake (Ninette and Pleasant Valley), Oak Lake, Metigoshe, Sandy Lake, Silver Beach Lake and Rivers Reservoir beach. The number of blue-green algae cells was above Manitoba’s recreational water quality objective at all beaches, while the concentration of algal toxin microcystin was below the recreational water quality objective at all beaches. First level algae advisory signs were posted at all above mentioned beaches this week.

	 

	Algal blooms are difficult to predict and may form and then disperse quickly or last for several days or weeks. Warm and calm weather coupled with relatively high nutrient loads provide ideal conditions for blue-green algae to develop. People are reminded to avoid swimming in water where severe algal blooms are visible and to prevent pets from drinking water along the shoreline where algal blooms are present. Home and cottage owners who use lake water as a source for drinking water should be aware that most small treatment systems are unable to remove algal toxins. Therefore, where blue-green algal blooms are present, avoid drinking the water or using it for other domestic purposes.

APPLICATIONS FOR MANITOBA JOB RESTART PROGRAM NOW AVAILABLE


	Eligible Manitobans looking to return to work can now apply for up to $2,000 in direct payments from the Manitoba Job Restart program, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“Our government believes in investing in solutions, and the solution here in Manitoba as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic is to help as many people get back to work, safely,” said Pallister. “As Manitoba continues to lead the country in recovery, I encourage all Manitobans to embrace the jobs that are available now as we restart our economy.”

	 

	The program will provide one initial payment of $500 plus three additional bi-weekly payments for $500 each, for a total of $2,000 over six weeks. Program participants must voluntarily stop collecting CERB or CESB support from the federal government. The province will fully finance the program, which does not require any contributions from employers for workers to qualify.

	 

	This is a voluntary-participation program, and there is no obligation for Manitobans to stop receiving CERB or CESB benefits if they choose not to participate. To remain in the program, approved applicants must:

	• actively return to work in Manitoba to a job with at least 30 hours per week in order to be eligible for the first $500 payment;

	• complete a simple declaration for each of the following two weeks certifying that they are still working at least 30 hours per week in order to receive the next three $500 payments;

	• no longer receive CERB, CESB or similar COVID-19 related support from the federal government;

	• follow Manitoba’s COVID-19 health guidelines in the workplace; and

	• continue residing permanently in Manitoba and be legally entitled to work in Canada.

	 

	The amounts received will be a taxable benefit. Manitobans can learn more about the program details and fill out an application at https://manitoba.ca/covid19/infomanitobans/mjrp.html.

PROVINCE ADVISES HIGH NUMBER OF BLACK BEAR INCIDENTS BEING REPORTED


	Manitoba Conservation and Climate is recording a higher than usual number of black bear interaction calls in a number of areas around the province and Manitobans are reminded they need to be bear smart in bear country.

	 

	One of the most common causes of bear-human conflict is the presence of bird feeders. Bird seed can attract bears as well as birds, and with other food sources plentiful for birds in the summer months, people are asked to put feeders away until later in the fall.

	 

	Once a bear is attracted to an area, it can associate that area with food and may return multiple times, which can be dangerous for people, but also for the bear. If a bear is identified as a problem animal, the province may have to take steps to trap and relocate it or possibly use lethal force.

	 

	To enjoy birdwatching, Manitobans are encouraged to use birdhouses, birdbaths or grow a variety of bird-friendly plant species in their yards. Bird feeders should be removed April to November. For winter bird-feeding, the feeders should be hung at least two metres above the ground and spilled seed should be cleaned up regularly.

	 

	Additional ‘Wildlife Smart’ tips to reduce the risk of conflicts with black bears and other wildlife include:

	• never approach or feed a bear or any other wild animal;

	• restrain (leash) dogs when walking outside to reduce the potential of it harassing a bear or of being attacked by one as unrestrained dogs can lead a bear back to the dog’s owner;

	• store garbage in a secure building or bear resistant container;

	• secure compost piles or compost food items indoors;

	• remove ripened or fallen fruit daily in the morning and before dusk and do not allow it to rot on the ground;

	• allow barbecue grills to burn for about two minutes after cooking to burn off grease and to eliminate odors; 

	• clean grills and grease cups after each use; 

	• clean up after picnics in the yard or on a deck and do not allow food odors to linger;

	• feed pets indoors; and

	• fully enclose backyard beehives and chicken coops – electric fencing is an effective bear deterrent.

	 

	These measures also apply to other wildlife species that can be a problem, such as the coyote, fox, raccoon and skunk.

	 

	Bears are wild animals and must be respected.  When in bear country, it is best to assume bears are in the vicinity even if no recent conflict or encounters have been reported. Carry bear deterrent spray and know how to use it.  Be aware of surroundings, walk or jog in groups, make noise and make sure things like listening to music with earphones do not impede hearing.

	 

	More information on how to be Wildlife Smart is available at www.manitoba.ca/human-wildlife.

PROVINCE INTRODUCES BAN ON COMMERCIAL EVICTIONS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  Commitment to Protect Businesses and Increase Uptake in Federal-Provincial Rent Assist Program Drives Temporary Measure: Fielding


	The Manitoba government is committed to protecting businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic by introducing a temporary ban on commercial evictions as part of an effort to drive increased participation in the federal-provincial cost-shared Canadian Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today. 

	 

	“We know this has been a tough time for many businesses and it should not be made worse through an eviction if a business does not have the ability to pay rent on time,” said Fielding. “It is our hope that this temporary measure will protect businesses, and at the same time spark increased participation in the federally and provincially cost-shared CECRA program.” 

	 

	Many businesses have suffered significant losses with either forced closure or limited ability to operate normally. Many are struggling to meet lease obligations, prevent layoffs and manage drops in revenue due to COVID-related circumstances. The government’s action will temporarily ban evictions of commercial tenants during the pandemic if the landlords and tenants are eligible for CECRA but have not applied. 

	 

	The federal government’s rent relief program has been set up to have landlords apply and work with their tenants to receive rent relief. Not all landlords eligible for this funding are applying, leaving tenants without an option to stay in their current leased commercial space. The CECRA program runs until Aug. 31.

	 

	Manitoba has received only approximately 145 applications and has paid out $1.5 million of the $64 million available. The minister said it is hoped this measure will create an additional incentive for landlords and tenants to work together and apply to the CECRA, as well as keep businesses from closing or having to relocate during the pandemic. 

	 

	The temporary measures have been introduced under The Emergency Measures Act and are consistent with initiatives in other provinces.

MANITOBA ANNOUNCES MAJOR INVESTMENT IN DOWNTOWN SAFETY PARTNERSHIP
					  New Community Outreach Model Will Help Connect Those in Need with Critical Resources:  Cullen


	The Manitoba government is investing $5 million in a community partnership focused on improving health, well-being and safety in downtown Winnipeg through expanded street outreach, including a 24-7 outreach presence in key areas for the first time, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	 

	“Whether you live, work or play downtown, we want to make sure everyone feels safe in the heart of Winnipeg, and the Downtown Safety Partnership expands on a community model that focuses on relationship building, respect and partnership,” said Cullen. “I’m pleased to support this collaboration to help make Winnipeg’s city centre a safe and vibrant community.” 

	 

	The provincial investment will allow Winnipeg’s Downtown Safety Partnership (DSP) to transition into a permanent, not-for-profit organization fully dedicated to enhancing the health, safety and well-being of all members of the downtown community.

	 

	“Community-centered outreach teams who can connect citizens with the help they need – whether that’s mental health and addictions support or help upgrading their skills and finding a job – translates into a better downtown for everyone,” said Marileen Bartlett, executive director of the Centre for Aboriginal Human Resource Development and a member of the DSP board of directors. “This is an opportunity to strengthen partnerships that will make our downtown safer, more inclusive and more welcoming for all.”

	 

	Priorities for the DSP include:

	• expanding the presence of downtown community outreach and safety teams, and extending outreach hours to allow a 24-7 presence in key areas for the first time,

	• enhancing downtown outreach via new community service teams of highly trained community support workers who can address situations that do not require a police or paramedic response, and

	• establishing a 24-7 Downtown Safety Communications Centre that will facilitate real-time information sharing among downtown safety partners and support existing downtown agencies in their work.

	 

	The minister noted the DSP’s community-centred approach will provide a welcoming presence, help build community trust, and strengthen collaboration and resources for agencies that currently operate downtown. 

	 

	“Today’s funding helps us build an expanded, permanent, community-centred outreach presence that provides the right resources and support at the right time,” said Kate Fenske, CEO, Downtown Winnipeg BIZ. “This model builds on past successes and puts renewed focus on proactively addressing community needs so everyone downtown feels safe and welcome.”

	 

	Further operational details about the Downtown Safety Partnership will be announced in the coming weeks, the minister noted. He added the new organization will be governed by a broadly representative board of downtown stakeholders and will receive guidance from a community advisory committee.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES UP TO $4.2-MILLION INCENTIVE FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE GREENHOUSE IN PARKLAND REGION
					  Investment Will Create Jobs, Stimulate Economic Growth:  Eichler


	DAUPHIN—Through the Manitoba Works Capital Incentive (MWCI), the Manitoba government will provide a rebate of up to $4.2 million over a maximum of 20 years to a commercial greenhouse development in the Parkland region, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced here today.

	 

	“The Manitoba Works Capital Incentive Program encourages businesses to invest and expand in our province by creating a competitive tax environment to help diversify Manitoba’s economy,” said Eichler. “We select projects like Vermillion Growers’ new greenhouse that focus on economic development and long-term job creation and substantially improve property values. Our investment in the Parkland region will create jobs and encourage further economic development in the area.”

	 

	Vermillion Growers has started construction of the first large-scale greenhouse in Manitoba. The high-tech hydroponic commercial greenhouse development in Dauphin will be designed for vegetable production, consisting initially of tomatoes with plans to expand to a wide range of produce. Phase One of the project is a 10-acre facility, with plans to expand to 60 acres after five years of production. Vermillion Growers plans to plant its first crop in early 2021. 

	 

	“Manitoba is committed to creating an environment for a competitive, sustainable and adaptable agriculture and agri-food industry that ensures it thrives as a key economic driver,” said Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen. “Having a large-scale greenhouse in Manitoba is very important from a food security standpoint – access to fresh, locally grown produce year-round is a great benefit for Manitobans.” 

	 

	“Canada currently imports close to 90 per cent of our table fresh tomatoes, but Vermillion Growers will displace some of these imported tomatoes with local product, meaning healthier food and more jobs for our community and province,” said Maria Deschauer, managing director and proprietor of Vermillion Growers. “Once fully built, the site will provide 60 acres of growing area, requiring Vermillion Growers to create the equivalent of 180 full-time positions. Vermillion Growers is thrilled by the support of the Manitoba government and looks forward to working with the province as Vermillion expands.”

	 

	The province unveiled the MWCI in May 2020 as a new approach to tax-increment financing that rebates the incremental education property taxes generated by a project for up to 20 years. Approved projects receive a tax rebate based on the difference between pre-development property tax revenue and the increased amount generated by the completed project. The program aims to encourage significant new business investment or existing business expansion, noted Eichler.

	 

	A new or existing business interested in establishing or expanding its operations in Manitoba may apply for the MWCI if: 

	• the business is prepared to make a minimum capital investment of $10 million to a specific property, which will be designated for tax-increment financing benefits; 

	• a minimum of 65 per cent of total project costs are from private sources; and 

	• there is demonstrable potential to create and/or maintain at least 10 new jobs in the province, or the new business activity will have a substantial and measurable net economic benefit to the province.

	 

	The minister’s visit to the region on Friday includes a Parkland regional economic development meeting held in collaboration with Team Manitoba strategic and regional partners, namely Manitoba’s new Rural Economic Development Corporation, North Forge Technology Exchange, World Trade Centre Winnipeg and Travel Manitoba.  The meeting will also include provincial representatives, the mayor and reeve of Dauphin, and key industry stakeholders, organizations and community leaders to discuss partnerships and ensure the Parkland region is best positioned to enable investment and economic growth.

MANITOBA EXPANDS SUPPORT FOR HOMELESS SHELTERS IN RESPONSE TO PANDEMIC


	The Manitoba government is investing nearly $760,000 to expand supports to vulnerable people experiencing homelessness as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	 

	“As we continue to respond to COVID-19 together, we must ensure there are services in place to support those who are most vulnerable including people experiencing homelessness,” said Stefanson. “These investments will help ensure trusted community-based organizations can extend or expand their supports, so everyone has a safe place when they need it.”

	 

	This builds on a $1.2-million investment for homeless shelters announced in April and will support:

	• expanded capacity at a Main Street Project (MSP) location on Disraeli Street in Winnipeg for the next three months, providing space for 180 beds every night ($135,000);

	• continued operation of a site on Sargent Avenue in Winnipeg, which has 39 beds for individuals who may need to self-isolate due to COVID-19, to be managed by MSP until the end of September ($242,000); and

	• ongoing operations of the Salvation Army’s Winnipeg Centre of Hope, as a need to decrease its capacity to meet physical distancing requirements has resulted in financial challenges ($360,000).

	 

	“We are very grateful to live in a province that has taken a well-planned approach to limiting the spread of the virus,” said Maj. Gordon Taylor, executive director, Salvation Army Winnipeg Centre of Hope. “There has been a tremendous sense of co-operation among various agencies and levels of government that has made it possible to meet unique needs and numerous challenges. We are especially grateful today for this financial assistance from the province, which will enable us to continue to meet those needs and plans for whatever challenges arise going forward.”

	 

	The Centre of Hope is at Henry Avenue and Martha Street, and includes a residential mental health program, transitional housing for individuals who have been released from a correctional facility, emergency shelter beds and a number of on-site programs to support people toward independence and stability.

	 

	The minister also noted this funding includes one month of operational costs ($22,000) previously announced to support Samaritan House Ministries’ Safe and Warm Shelter in Brandon.  The 10-bed emergency shelter typically is open only in the winter months, but ongoing provincial support has helped it continue to serve vulnerable clients throughout the summer.  

	 

	This investment is part of the Manitoba Protection Plan, a government-wide response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It takes a community to make this happen, and so we are grateful to our partners who will help ensure our families have access to healthy food and family-focused learning activities.” 

	 

	This site represents $800,000 of the $2.5-million Home Nutrition and Learning Pilot Program being offered in communities across Manitoba. More information can be found at www.manitoba.ca/nutritionlearningprogram. 

	 

	“I am so pleased to see Brandon and Samaritan House selected as a pilot site for the Home Nutrition and Learning Program,” said Mayor Rick Chrest, City of Brandon. “Samaritan House has been a valuable and efficient provider of regular nourishment and training for vulnerable people in our community, and their partnership with the government of Manitoba’s initiative will be encouraging and helpful to those in need of assistance.”

	 

	The minister noted the province is also investing $132,000 to ensure Samaritan House Ministries’ Safe and Warm Shelter can continue to operate over the summer months. The Safe and Warm Shelter is a 10-bed emergency shelter for adults who experience occasional homelessness.

	 

	These investments are part of the Manitoba Protection Plan, a government-wide response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister noted.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT PLANS FOR IN-CLASS LEARNING TO RESUME IN SEPTEMBER
					  Thorough Planning Necessary to Ensure Students,  Teachers Can Return to Classrooms:  Goertzen

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government has released a planning framework for the resumption of in-class learning, with teachers and staff returning to classrooms on Sept. 2 and students on Sept. 8, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	 

	“We are planning to have all students, from kindergarten to Grade 12, back in classrooms in September. While we can’t be sure what the COVID-19 pandemic will look like in the fall, detailed planning is needed to ensure schools can resume in-class learning and to prepare for different scenarios,” said Goertzen. “This framework will allow schools and school divisions to prepare plans that are flexible at the local level, yet consistent with those at other sites across the province.”

	 

	The framework provides guidance for school divisions to develop detailed reopening plans to be submitted to Manitoba Education for three public health scenarios including:

	• in-class learning with near-normal conditions;

	• in-class learning, taking additional public health measures into consideration; and 

	• remote learning from home, with limited use of school facilities.

	 

	The minister noted that while the plan is for all students to return to classroom learning in the fall, Manitoba Education will provide final confirmation by Aug. 1 based on public health directions.

	 

	Significant consultation with students, parents, teachers and education stakeholders occurred over the past month to gauge their comfort, with tens of thousands of Manitobans providing feedback.

	 

	Divisions will ensure all schools have plans that are accessible to parents and students. Funded independent schools will also be asked to submit plans and post them publicly.

	 

	“Public health officials expect the COVID-19 virus to be around for some time and that’s why schools need to develop plans for the fall,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “In addition to these plans, it will continue to be important for people to stay home if they are sick, ensure physical distancing, continue to practise good hand hygiene and cover coughs.”

	 

	The framework also outlines key considerations that should be addressed in the school and division plans including:

	• ensuring schools can respond and adapt to changing public health orders and guidance;

	• making sure any necessary physical distancing requirements can be met;

	• considering the use of cohorts in classrooms, on buses and during activities to limit exposure to COVID-19;

	• planning with a focus on in-class learning and establishing priorities;

	• looking at ways to accommodate specialty programming and extracurricular activities;

	• considering how school transportation can be safely offered;

	• looking at blended learning options that can be implemented quickly;

	• making arrangements for students, teachers and staff who may be at higher risk of COVID-19; and

	• considering learning and assessment needs, as well as any educational gaps for students as a result of the pandemic.

	 

	“Students, parents, teachers, staff and administrators have had to make many adjustments in a very short period of time, and I thank everyone who has worked hard to find solutions to keep everyone safe during the pandemic,” said Goertzen. “By taking the time to develop thorough plans, we can continue to protect the health and well-being of our school communities while ensuring that students have the opportunity to learn and develop their skills.”

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT INVESTS MORE THAN $8.5 MILLION IN SUPPORT FOR FORTWHYTE ALIVE
					  Environmental Education is Important for the Future of our Province and Planet:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is providing more than $8.5 million to support conservancy and educational activities at FortWhyte Alive, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“For three decades, FortWhyte Alive has been a leader in nature education and advancing conservation, helping generations of Manitobans and visitors understand the value of a healthy natural environment,” said Pallister. “Programs that deliver environmental education are important for the future of our province and planet, and our government is proud to support FortWhyte Alive and the tremendous work it does to help teach and support our leaders of tomorrow.”

	 

	The province’s $4.5-million commitment to the FortWhyte Forever Capital Campaign includes a deep energy retrofit of the interpretive centre exterior and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in interior spaces and exhibits. A new Buffalo Crossing multi-purpose public facility will be constructed, and will feature educational and recreational elements including adventure and nature play areas. 

	 

	The contribution is being made through the New Building Canada Fund – Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component – National and Regional Projects, with the Government of Canada also investing $4.7 million.

	 

	Work is underway on the interpretive centre and construction on the Buffalo Crossing facility is anticipated to begin in early 2021, with project completion being targeted for 2022, the premier noted.

	 

	“Now more than ever, we see how important time spent in nature is as it restores us, builds resilience and gives us a sense of hope,” said Liz Wilson, president and CEO of FortWhyte Alive. “This forward-thinking investment by the Province of Manitoba provides stability to FortWhyte Alive and ensures hands-on environmental education, grounded in climate change science, will be accessible for generations of Manitobans.”

	 

	The province has also provided a $4-million contribution to the FortWhyte Forever Endowment Fund held by The Winnipeg Foundation. This contribution will generate revenue of approximately $200,000 per year to consolidate and replace long-standing annual program support previously provided by several provincial government grants.

	 

	“Our government is committed to a cleaner, greener Manitoba, and that includes a bright, sustainable future for FortWhyte Alive,” said the premier.

	 

	In May 2020, an additional $75,000 was committed to FortWhyte Alive’s exhibits and create an interpretive plan, the premier added. This funding was provided through the Building Sustainable Communities program, which provides grants to non-profit and charitable organization, municipalities and Northern Affairs community councils.

JOBS ON 9TH PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORTS TO GET PEOPLE IN BRANDON AND SURROUNDING AREA BACK TO WORK


	BRANDON—A new service will help people prepare for and find employment, as well as get off provincial social assistance once they find work in Brandon and surrounding communities, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced at a ceremonial grand opening here today.  

	 

	“Our government believes in the value of work, and Jobs on 9th has been designed to connect people with the information and resources they need to successfully join the workforce,” said Stefanson. “The personalized, comprehensive approach of Jobs on 9th helps Manitobans move off Employment and Income Assistance (EIA) into meaningful work in their communities, creating a lifetime of benefits for themselves and their families. This is increasingly important as we address the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

	 

	Jobs on 9th, located at 157-340 Ninth Ave. in Brandon, began working with clients in November 2019. Three staff help clients who are looking for employment and training options by assessing their needs and rapidly developing personalized plans to help them enter or return to the workforce. Since it opened, Jobs on 9th counsellors have established strong partnerships with community resources and non-governmental organizations that support individuals seeking work, such as Samaritan House Employment Resource Centre (SH-ERC). 

	 

	“With the launching of the new employment program Jobs on 9th, we will continue to work with the province to provide increased support to transition people into employment,” said Nataliya Masyuk, SH-ERC program manager/employment officer. “The new employment program will increase EIA recipients’ job readiness and boost their confidence by reducing and removing barriers for employment. In conjunction, SH-ERC will support clients in accomplishing their employment goals by providing resume services and delivering information through employment workshops. We will work collaboratively to improve clients’ success rate for employment and help them to achieve financial independence faster.”

	 

	Services at Jobs on 9th include resume development, job-search counselling, job, education and training referrals, and access to computers, phones and printers. Work-related expenses for clothing, transportation and equipment are also available for eligible clients. Staff follow clients’ progress for up to 90 days to support their success and to address any possible challenges.  

	 

	Since it launched, Jobs on 9th has provided services to more than 170 clients and about one-quarter of them have gained independence from EIA to date, the minister noted.

	 

	“The City of Brandon is always pleased to see supports for job creation and employment opportunities in our community,” said Mayor Rick Chrest, City of Brandon. “The establishment of this service for our area has been well-received by local clients.”

	 

	This approach is modelled after the successful Jobs on Market office in Winnipeg. Since Jobs on Market launched in February 2017, it has worked with more than 6,600 people and over 3,100 of them have gained financial independence.

	 

	The minister noted that Jobs on 9th is highlighted as one of the priority areas for the Department of Families in its 12-month action plan, recognizing its importance to clients, the community and the province overall. The strategy is available online at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/pubs/shared-priorities-sustainable-progress.pdf. 

	 

	Individuals in Brandon and the surrounding region who receive EIA should contact their counsellors directly for more information. Information is also available by phone at 204-726-6620, via email at JO9@gov.mb.ca and online at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/eia/index.html.

PROVINCE RELEASES PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT RESULTS FOR INCREASED SAFETY OPTIONS AT GARVEN ROAD AND PR 206
					  Roundabout Construction to Begin in Summer 2020: Schuler


	The Manitoba government is sharing the results of public engagement undertaken in May on options for increased safety at the intersection of Garven Road (PR 213) and PR 206, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	 

	“The number of responses we received through our online engagement really shows how concerned residents are about this intersection,” said Schuler. “We need a permanent solution to ensure drivers are safe and we can now move forward with construction on a project that has had significant input from residents in the area.”

	 

	The minister noted the intersection of PR 206 and PR 213 (Garven Road) has a history of vehicle collisions and serves one of the fastest-growing areas of the province. The province has implemented short-term solutions over the past couple of years, such as the reduction of speed limits in the area and installation of rumble strips to warn drivers of the upcoming stop sign.

	 

	The Manitoba government undertook a virtual public engagement online via EngageMB from May 25 to June 5. The engagement presented two options:  the installation of traffic lights and auxiliary turning lanes, and a roundabout.

	 

	A total of 505 responses were received and 80 per cent of respondents reported using the intersection daily or weekly. Construction to improve safety at the intersection was the option chosen by 87 per cent of engagement participants.

	 

	“We are incredibly pleased at the participation rate of the virtual engagement, considering Manitoba Infrastructure’s in-person open houses receive on average 75 to 100 participants,” said Schuler. “Due to public health guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgency to improve safety at this intersection, we tested out a virtual model. Based on its success, we hope to incorporate online public engagement on future projects as it offers an accessible and convenient format to involve more Manitobans.”

	 

	Staff identified several themes when analyzing the feedback including increased safety through a combination of driver education, traffic law enforcement and roundabout design. 

	 

	Results of the engagement indicated a roundabout is the preferred option for the intersection. Construction on the project is expected to begin this summer and be completed this fall, the minister noted.

	 

	“Safety is a top priority for our Springfield council and we welcome the safety upgrades at the intersection of PR 206 and Garven Road,” said Mayor Tiffany Fell, Rural Municipality of Springfield. “We appreciate the province has taken the time to listen to our residents.”

	 

	EngageMB is a central location where the public can easily learn about and contribute to all Manitoba government engagements underway. It is a convenient location for Manitobans to learn engagement results and view a final report on the initiative under consideration. The minister noted the government is committed to be accountable to the public, include the public in decision-making processes and be transparent on findings and outcomes.

	The plate features a bright gold “Cure Childhood Cancer” slogan across the bottom, in addition to the familiar cancer awareness ribbon. The new plates, which are administered by Manitoba Public Insurance, will be available for purchase today.  

	 

	The cost of each set of plates will be $70, with $30 from every plate purchase going toward the Madox’s Warriors Foundation, which is committed to consulting with the Children’s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba and CancerCare Manitoba to determine how funds would best be utilized prior to making donation decisions.

	 

	“Madox’s Warriors are honoured to be collaborating with both the government and Manitoba Public Insurance to bring more awareness to an important and underfunded cause,” said the Suzio family. “We are also very proud to be leading Canada as the first province to bring forth an initiative of this kind.”

	 

	Madox’s Warriors Foundation is a not-for-profit, private charitable foundation created to raise awareness of childhood cancer and raise much-needed funds toward childhood cancer research.

	 

	Madox’s Warriors was created in honour of Winnipegger Madox Suzio, who passed away in 2014 at the age of nine after a heroic battle with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG). Madox’s parents, Marco and Suzanne Suzio, have since dedicated themselves to raising awareness about childhood cancer, establishing the foundation. 

	 

	DIPG are highly aggressive and difficult-to-treat brain tumors found at the base of the brain. Approximately 300 children are diagnosed with DIPG each year, usually between the ages of five to nine.

MEASURES TO MAKE LIFE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR MANITOBANS TAKE EFFECT JULY 1
					  Changes Will Save Hard-Working Manitobans More Than $80 Million:  Fielding


	Several key measures introduced by the Manitoba government to reduce costs for citizens and businesses will come into effect July 1, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today. 

	 

	“Our government is committed to making life more affordable for Manitobans, and we especially want to ensure we are supporting families and businesses during the difficult financial times brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Fielding. “Over the past months, we have introduced several measures that will take effect July 1 and save Manitobans more than $80 million this year, at a time when they need it most.”

	 

	In April, the province announced it would make home and business property insurance more affordable by accelerating the removal of $75 million of annual provincial sales tax (PST) from residential and business properties, effective July 1. The province estimates removing the sales tax on property insurance will save residential property owners $38 million per year and commercial property owners $37 million a year.

	 

	Starting July 1, the province is reducing vehicle registration fees by 10 per cent, which is expected to save drivers $11 million, and builds on the $110 million in rebate cheques that Manitoba Public Insurance returned to policyholders this spring.

	 

	The minister said these measures are among several in the 2020 Tax Rollback Guarantee, introduced by the Manitoba government to make life more affordable for individuals, families and businesses. 

	 

	“We want to help Manitoba taxpayers hang on to more of their hard-earned dollars, which is even more important in these challenging times brought on by the global pandemic,” said Fielding. “These measures build on other tax initiatives our government has introduced, such as reducing the PST to seven per cent from eight, indexing the basic personal allowance and personal income tax brackets, and removing PST from the preparation of wills.”

	 

	Due to COVID-19, the province also extended filing deadlines for small and medium-sized businesses with monthly remittances of no more than $10,000 for the April, May and June sales tax and Health and Post-Secondary Education Tax Levy, commonly called the payroll tax. Fielding announced today the deadlines are now being extended through September.

	 

	He noted in April and May, the sales and payroll tax deferrals resulted in close to $11 million in savings for Manitoba businesses. 

	 

	Information on filing requirements is available at www.gov.mb.ca/finance/taxation/bulletins.html.   

	 

	As the premier announced in late March, due to the unanticipated costs and reduced revenues caused by COVID-19, Manitoba has delayed its planned PST reduction to six per cent from seven and the implementation of a green levy until 2021. Both were initially planned to take effect July 1.

PROVINCE ISSUES REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS TO MODERNIZE COURT INFORMATION SYSTEMS


	The Manitoba government is issuing a request for proposals (RFP) from vendors to implement an Integrated Case Management system that will improve efficiency and access to justice for Manitobans, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	 

	“This project will help to ensure more Manitobans across our province have access to justice information and it is an important step in modernizing Manitoba’s courts,” said Cullen. “Once the new system is implemented, it will improve the way information is handled across the court system.”

	 

	The minister noted the new technology will improve efficiencies and provide many other benefits including:

	• consolidating to a single provincewide system that minimizes data-entry and shares real-time information updates,

	• reducing reliance on paper,

	• providing the public and stakeholders with online access to court records, and

	• facilitating online dispute resolution.

	 

	“The most common complaint about the justice system is that it is slow, complicated and costly,” said Chief Justice Richard Chartier, chief justice of Manitoba. “The new system will facilitate court hearings and service to the public using web-based and video technology as well as out-of-court dispute resolution. The expected outcome is for simpler, faster and more efficient judicial proceedings.” 

	 

	The state-of-the-art information technology system will support the operations of all three levels of Manitoba courts and its branches. Currently, there are more than 20 different systems throughout Manitoba courts that are not integrated and the majority of the systems are paper-based, requiring manual updating.

	 

	“Technology helps us to provide greater access to justice, and these changes will complement other recently implemented improvements to the court’s scheduling and case flow models in all areas of judicial service,” said Chief Justice Glenn Joyal, chief justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench. “Given the diverse breadth of the judicial service provided by the Court of Queen’s Bench in the areas of criminal, civil, family and child protection proceedings, this modernization will be highly beneficial to Manitobans.” 

	 

	“The provincial court of Manitoba presides in all court centres and up to 50 circuit court communities in Manitoba,” said Chief Judge Margaret Wiebe, chief judge of the provincial court. “A single, web-based case management system that could be accessed remotely throughout the province would speed up court proceedings and make the system more efficient overall.” 

	 

	Once implemented, the system will reduce the need for personal attendance at court offices by counsel and the public to conduct routine business such as filing documents, scheduling hearings and paying fines or fees. In addition, online dispute resolution will reduce backlog and allow the court to focus on more serious, high-conflict matters.

	 

	Due to the scale and technical nature of the project, the province worked with outside agencies to complete the request for proposals. An external expert was hired to develop the technical content, and a change management consultant worked with Manitoba courts and its stakeholders to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth transition. 

	 

	The project is a result of the Idea Fund, which supports innovative initiatives within government. These ideas are advanced by front-line public servants and are designed to produce meaningful return on investment for taxpayers.  

	 

	The RFP has been posted to MERX at www.merx.com under an open tendering process.

PROVINCE LAUNCHES NEW FAMILY RESOLUTION SERVICE TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO FAMILY LAW

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is launching the first phase of a new single-window Family Resolution Service that will ensure family law services are more accessible and affordable to Manitobans, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today. 

	 

	“Couples and families who are separating are currently dependent on the court system, which can be adversarial, complex, expensive and slow,” said Cullen. “This can fuel hostilities and slow the resolution of disputes, which has a negative effect on the emotional and physical well-being of the participants, especially children.”

	 

	The new Family Resolution Service delivers a seamless continuum of affordable services to all Manitobans, and expands front-end support and out of court options. It was designed based on input from Manitobans and is supported by legislative change and service innovation, the minister said.

	 

	Families can now access:

	• early resolution support services delivered by family guides with expertise in domestic violence and safety planning, conflict resolution and mediation, family law and court processes;

	• navigation assistance to other culturally and linguistically appropriate specialized services, which could include a new Child Support Service, Legal Aid, expanded enforcement or other financial, legal or health and social services; 

	• self-service tools and a resource inventory that is searchable by region and issue; and 

	• support to complete any prerequisites for court.

	 

	The new service also allows families to access support electronically, which is particularly beneficial during the COVID-19  pandemic, the minister said. 

	 

	The minister also noted that changes to The Family Law Modernization Act coming into effect July 1 expand the role of the Child Support Recalculation Service and give it the authority to make initial child support decisions in a broad range of cases, such as changes in employment, without going to court. 

	 

	The Manitoba government also expanded the Maintenance Enforcement Program (MEP) in April to help families meet the increased challenges brought about by COVID-19. The program now has authority to review and adjust maintenance as needed, and more families have been able to resolve support enforcement issues by working with the program instead of having to make court applications.

	 

	It is critical to note that families will still be able to pursue in-court options and appear before a judge if required, the minister added.

	 

	These changes are expected to take thousands of matters out of court and could result in up to $41 million in annual savings in court and legal fees for Manitoba families, noted the minister.

	 

	“These enhancements reflect our progress on recommendations made by Manitobans and are the latest in our ongoing efforts to modernize the family law system in Manitoba,” said Cullen.

	 

	Every year, approximately 3,000 to 5,000 Manitoba families are affected by separation or divorce. To read Manitoba’s Family Law Action Plan or find more information and tools, go to www.manitoba.ca/familylaw/.

	 

	Manitobans who do not have internet access or require additional assistance can contact a family guide by calling 204-945-2313 or 1-844-808-2313 (toll-free) or email getguidance@gov.mb.ca for a personalized response.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES APPOINTMENT OF ASSOCIATE CHIEF JUDGE


	The Manitoba government has appointed Judge Malcolm McDonald as an associate chief judge of the provincial court of Manitoba, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	 

	“Judge McDonald brings a wealth of experience to the bench, and his commitment is evident in the roles he has chosen to take outside of the court including as an educator, facilitator and mentor,” said Cullen. “I’m confident he will serve Manitobans well in this new role.”

	 

	McDonald was appointed to the provincial court of Manitoba in 2010 and currently sits in The Pas. Since his appointment, McDonald has presided at the swearing-in ceremonies of town councillors and local school trustees, and has appeared before local student groups to explain the functioning of the provincial court and duties and responsibilities of provincial court judges. 

	 

	He has presented at education sessions of the provincial court on procedure and rules in provincial family court proceedings. He served as a facilitator at a joint Manitoba/Saskatchewan Bench conference, and as a mentor for a recent judicial appointment.

	 

	McDonald is the chairperson of the Facilities Committee of the provincial court and is currently a member of the Family Rules Committee, the Canadian Association of Provincial Court Judges and the Committee on Access to Justice. 

	 

	He graduated from the University of Manitoba in 1982 with a bachelor of law and was a partner at Law North, formerly McDonald Huberdeau, prior to his judicial appointment. 

	 

	Associate chief judges are appointed for a non-renewable term of seven years. The appointment will take effect Aug. 1, upon the term expiry of associate chief judge Shauna Hewitt-Michta. Chief judge Margaret Wiebe requested expressions of interest from the court regarding this appointment. McDonald was recommended by the minister of justice in consultation with the chief judge.  

	 

	The Manitoba government would also like to take this opportunity to thank Hewitt-Michta for her commitment and continued support in enhancing access to justice in regional and northern court centres and communities.  

	 

	An official swearing-in ceremony will be scheduled in the near future.

MANITOBA SUPPORTS EXPANSION OF THE MOTHERING PROJECT AT MOUNT CARMEL CLINIC
					  Funding Supports End of Birth Alerts as of June 30:  Stefanson

Background Information

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is investing nearly $400,000 to double the capacity of the Mothering Project (Manito Ikwe Kagiikwe), ensuring better health and family outcomes for at-risk women and their children as part of a commitment to end the use of birth alerts on June 30, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	 

	“The Mothering Project helps keep families together by supporting vulnerable mothers when they need help,” said Stefanson. “Our government is committed to preventative programs that help to reduce the number of children in care by building partnerships with organizations like Mount Carmel Clinic. This new funding will ensure more families can stay together safely with the help of community-based supports they know and trust.”  

	 

	The Mothering Project at Mount Carmel Clinic helps connect vulnerable mothers with services and programs to support health and wellness for themselves and their children. Culturally safe supports are available during pregnancy and throughout their children’s early years including pre-natal care, health services, drop-in programs, healthy meals and nutritional learning, parenting groups, child development supports and child-care services, access to Indigenous ceremonies and teachings, and support to address needs such as housing, mental health and addictions, counselling and system navigation.  

	 

	This investment will allow Mount Carmel Clinic to serve up to 200 families by adding four new staff.  

	 

	“This expansion will allow us to build even more positive relationships with mothers,” said Bobbette Shoffner, executive director, Mount Carmel Clinic. “We are creating a circle of care to ensure a healthier pregnancy and more positive outcomes for mom, baby and the entire family in the longer term. An investment today creates a lifetime of benefits for all of our participating families.” 

	 

	Eligible women are either pregnant or have had a child in the past year and are considered vulnerable because they struggle with substance use and addictions, are homeless or at risk of homelessness, are involved with the child welfare system or at high risk to have a child taken into care, or are not connected with community supports. 

	 

	The minister noted this investment supports Manitoba’s plan to replace the use of birth alerts with preventative and community-based supports for families. Over the past year, the province has worked very closely with child welfare authorities and agencies to help ensure at-risk mothers and families are connected with resources, information and supports, while limiting the use of birth alerts to the greatest extent possible. Four birth alerts were issued in May 2020, compared with 38 in May 2019.

	 

	Manitoba Child and Family Services (CFS) agencies will be able to refer more women to this program, which further supports the shift away from the practice of birth alerts. The program will include a CFS liaison who will create strong partnerships with the CFS system to reinforce this change in practice. Expanding this program also supports the province’s plan to transform the child welfare system and aligns with recommendations from the Child Welfare Legislative Review Committee.

	 

	A 2015 evaluation found the Mothering Project had reduced the number of children entering care, increased access to health-care services and reduced substance use.

	 

	Funding for these initiatives is being provided under the Canada-Manitoba Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement. In the past eight months, the Manitoba government has committed $38.2 million toward 21 initiatives to improve mental health and addictions services throughout the province.

	 

	The province will commit $350,000 annually to Mount Carmel Clinic, beginning in 2021-22 to ensure that expanded services continue.

	 

	Mount Carmel Clinic is a community-based not-for-profit organization that provides primary health and community services, as well as early learning supports, primarily to residents of Winnipeg’s north end. For more information, visit www.mountcarmel.ca/.

PROVINCE INVESTS IN NEW DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE, CLOSER TO HOME
					  Manitoba Patients to Benefit from New Diagnostic and Treatment Machines, CT Scanners and Other Equipment: Friesen


	As part of its ongoing commitment to enhancing the care available at health-care facilities across the province, the Manitoba government has invested in new diagnostic equipment to be installed at sites throughout the province, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	 

	“Improving patient access and quality of care is largely dependent on being able to quickly determine what care is required and where it can best be delivered,” said Friesen. “Investing in diagnostic equipment for facilities throughout the province not only ensures Manitobans are able to access specialized services and care when they need it, in many cases it will allow them to seek that care closer to home.”

	 

	This investment supports new or replacement equipment at sites both within and outside Winnipeg. In total, six pieces of diagnostic equipment have been approved and will be tendered in the near future or are already in the process of being installed. They include:

	• a linear accelerator for radiation treatment at CancerCare Manitoba,

	• a general duty X-ray machine and a liquid chromatography system at HSC Winnipeg,

	• CT scanners at Brandon Regional Health Centre and Victoria General Hospital, and

	• a new interventional radiology unit at St. Boniface Hospital.

	 

	The total investment in these projects is subject to the tendering process, the minister said.

	 

	Additionally, the Manitoba government has invested approximately $720,000 to purchase and install two general duty X-ray machines at the Bethesda Regional Health Centre in Steinbach and the Altona Community Memorial Health Centre. Both pieces of equipment are now operational.

	 

	“Ensuring diagnostic equipment is reliable and ensures timely access to quality care for Manitoba patients are high priorities as we continue to implement the recommendations of Manitoba’s first provincial clinical and preventive services plan,” said Petr Kresta, chief operating officer of diagnostic services, Shared Health. “Investments in this vital equipment will ensure we continue to meet the needs of Manitoba’s growing and aging population.”

	 

	Since 2016, the Manitoba government has significantly improved diagnostic services in the province. This includes the recent launch of echocardiography services at the Selkirk Regional Health Centre. MRI services have also been added in Selkirk and at the Dauphin Regional Health Centre to handle increasing patient volumes.

	 

	“Our government has responded to the growing demands of an aging population with increasing health-care needs by expanding diagnostic services and bringing them closer to home,” said Friesen.  “These new pieces of clinical equipment are aligned with Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan and will ensure more patients get the care they need, when they need it.”

PROVINCE INVESTS IN MANITOBA JOB RESTART PROGRAM
					  Manitobans Who Return to Work Could Each Receive $2,000: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is introducing the Manitoba Job Restart program, which will provide direct payments to a maximum of $2,000 to help qualified Manitobans return to work, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“The Manitoba Job Restart program could help bring tens of thousands of Manitobans back to work safely and help our economy recover,” said Pallister. “The federal government is currently subsidizing the wages of more than eight million workers in Canada through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB). While these programs have helped Canadians through financial challenges caused by the pandemic, CERB has become a barrier preventing some from returning to work.”

	 

	The premier noted Manitoba’s program will provide one initial payment of $500 plus three additional bi-weekly payments for $500 each, for a total of $2,000 over six weeks. Program participants must voluntarily stop collecting CERB or CESB support from the federal government. 

	 

	The province will fully finance the program, which does not require any contributions from employers in order for workers to qualify.

	 

	“The best thing we can do to speed Canada’s economic recovery is to find safe ways to get people back to work,” said Dan Kelly, president and chief executive officer, Canadian Federation of Independent Business. “The Manitoba Job Restart program will help encourage more employees to return to their pre-COVID jobs, assisting both workers and small businesses along the way. CFIB encourages other provinces and the federal government to consider this and other ways to quickly transition workers from CERB back to paid employment.”

	 

	To remain in the program, approved applicants must: 

	• actively return to work in Manitoba to a job with at least 30 hours per week in order to be eligible for the first $500 payment;

	• complete a simple declaration for each of the following two weeks certifying that they are still working at least 30 hours per week in order to receive the next three $500 payments;

	• no longer receive CERB, CESB or similar COVID-19 related support from the federal government;

	• follow Manitoba’s COVID-19 health guidelines in the workplace; and

	• continue residing permanently in Manitoba and be legally entitled to work in Canada.

	 

	The Manitoba Job Restart program will accept applications until July 31. This is a voluntary-participation program, and there is no obligation for Manitobans to stop receiving CERB or CESB benefits if they choose not to participate. The amounts received will be a taxable benefit. The funding of the Manitoba Job Restart program will be absorbed from the remaining unspent balances in the $240-million Manitoba Gap Protection Plan and Manitoba Summer Student Recovery Jobs Program, although further funding will be made available if there is significant uptake, the premier noted.

	 

	Manitobans can learn more about the program details today at:

	Application forms will be available June 26.

	As of yesterday, an additional 1,951 laboratory tests were performed between June 19 and June 21 (Friday – 733, Saturday – 850 and Sunday – 368). This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 58,221. 

	 

	While COVID-19 activity remains very low in the province, personal care homes (PCH) will soon begin permitting limited indoor visits for designated visitors. The indoor visits, to be approved by individual PCH care teams, will enable each resident to identify a short list of individuals who may visit during allotted times. 

	 

	These scheduled visits will be a limited supplement to outdoor and virtual visits, which will continue, and are not a return to normal. Visits must be scheduled, and visitors will be screened upon arrival for symptoms and history of travel or exposure to COVID-19. Visitors must maintain physical distancing throughout their visit. Individuals will also be requested to bring and wear a non-medical mask for the duration of their time inside the facility.

MANITOBA EXTENDS PROVISIONS TO PROTECT TENANTS DURING COVID-19


	Manitoba’s Residential Tenancies Branch advises that two measures put in place to help protect tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic will be extended until Sept. 30.

	 

	The current freeze on rent increases for residential tenants will continue. Landlords can continue to give notice of their intention to increase rent, but the higher rate cannot be charged until after Sept. 30. 

	 

	Tenants are expected to continue paying rent in full and on time. If this is not possible, tenants and landlords should work together to develop a payment schedule and agree on any other necessary terms. Late fees continue to be prohibited for failure to pay rent during this time.

	 

	Non-urgent eviction hearings will continue to be postponed, and will not be scheduled until after Sept. 30. In the interim, residential landlords may only evict tenants for urgent health and safety reasons. Tenants cannot be evicted for non-payment of rent. 

	 

	Both of these provisions were put in place on March 24 in response to COVID-19.  For more information, landlords and tenants should visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19 or www.gov.mb.ca/rtb.

MANITOBA TO DEVELOP OUTDOOR, ALL-SEASON VISITATION SHELTERS AT PERSONAL CARE HOMES
					  Government Also Accepting Proposals for Safety and Capital Upgrades: Friesen

Watch news conference



<
div>
	The Manitoba government is working to develop outdoor, all-season shelters that will be located near personal care homes and be suitable for residents to safely visit with loved ones, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	 

	“Allowing personal care home residents to safely maintain the connections they have with their families and friends during the COVID-19 pandemic is central to their ongoing health and well-being,” said Friesen. “We are planning ahead by moving forward with the development of all-season shelters, ensuring those needed and valuable visits can remain safe and uninterrupted.”

	 

	The Manitoba government will ask for feedback on conceptual designs for personal care home shelters in the near future. The shelters will be outside, but close to personal care homes year-round. They must be accessible, protected from the elements, easily cleaned and provide a space for quality connections. Feedback can be provided at http://EngageMB.ca.

	 

	“Despite advances in technology that have allowed for virtual visits, this pandemic has taught us that nothing can replicate a face-to-face visit,” the minister said. “Today’s announcement shows that once again Manitobans are innovative, resilient and kind-hearted.”

	 

	Across Canada, approximately 80 per cent of all deaths related to COVID-19 have been linked to those living in personal care homes. In Manitoba, similar outcomes have been avoided thanks to a number of precautions taken in the early stages of the pandemic including strict visitor restrictions, enhanced screening for staff and the implementation of the one-site staffing model at personal care homes.

	 

	“The pandemic will challenge personal care homes for months to come, but we are committed to finding the right balance in enabling this all important human contact to continue while preserving the safety of residents, staff and families,” said Charles Gagné, CEO, Actionmarguerite. “Accessible spaces designed to meet these goals can only help but enhance these precious interactions and reduce the effects of loneliness by virtue of the public health restrictions.”

	 

	Additionally, the Manitoba government will be requesting proposals for safety and capital upgrades at personal care homes including: 

	• sprinkler protection,

	• fire alarm voice communication systems,

	• carbon monoxide detection,

	• emergency lighting,

	• infection control measures so not to affect residents, and 

	• planning and phasing of moving vulnerable residents.

	 

	The minister added these proposals are intended to build on the government’s commitment to ensure health-care facilities are in line with revised Manitoba Fire Code requirements including provision of fire suppression systems and increased fire separation enhancements to better protect residents, staff and the public.

STATEMENT FROM INDIGENOUS AND NORTHERN RELATIONS MINISTER EILEEN CLARKE ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY


	As the minister of Indigenous and northern relations, I would like to acknowledge June 21 as National Indigenous People’s Day in Canada, and encourage Manitobans to celebrate and recognize the unique heritage, diverse cultures and outstanding contributions of Indigenous peoples. 

	 

	Manitoba is the proud home of the Anishinaabe, Cree, Oji-Cree, Inuit, Dene and Dakota people, as well as the Métis Nation, and National Indigenous Peoples Day is an opportunity to learn about Indigenous cultures. 

	 

	Along with the sharing of cultural and historical experiences, National Indigenous Peoples Day is also a time to acknowledge our continued path toward reconciliation with all Indigenous peoples in Manitoba and across Canada. We are making great strides toward reconciliation and teaching Indigenous perspectives in our workplaces, schools and governments, but we must continue to grow in our understanding of the treaties, Indigenous history and traditions.

	 

	We also commend the courage and action shown by Manitoba’s Indigenous leadership in keeping their communities and people safe during COVID-19, and urge all Manitobans to continue to heed the advice of our chief provincial public heath officer.  

	 

	The Government of Canada is encouraging Canadians to celebrate this year's National Indigenous History Month and National Indigenous Peoples Day at home to keep communities safe during the COVID-19 crisis.

	 

	More information about National Indigenous Peoples Day is available at:

MANITOBA INVESTS MORE THAN $675,000 IN YOUTH-LED MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTIONS INITIATIVE


Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is investing more than $675,000 over three years in a successful youth-led mental health and addictions prevention program, Indigenous and Northern Relations Minister Eileen Clarke and Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	 

	“PAX Dream Makers promotes youth as the change makers, supporting their work toward Mino Pimatisiwin (the good life) by helping them develop and implement action plans for themselves and their communities,” said Clarke. “This investment will help students undertake training to become ‘Dream Makers’ and take on leadership roles that help them engage other children and youth in their schools.”  

	 

	The new funding will support PAX Dream Makers, a youth engagement and leadership initiative that will provide two years of training and engagement to an additional 88 youth from Northern First Nation communities, Rolling River and other school divisions. These youth will become PAX Dream Makers and interact with children and youth in their schools and communities, inspiring more than 800 other young Manitobans, Clarke noted.

	 

	“By empowering youth to take leadership roles by creating peace, productivity, health and happiness, in their communities through PAX Dream Makers, we help them strengthen their relationships with each other and with youth in other communities,” said Stefanson.“This helps build stronger communities and leads to more positive mental health.”

	 

	Dream Makers participants and their adult mentors attend four gatherings over the course of 24 months. Teams are brought together from different schools, allowing youth from different communities to foster relationships and learn from one another. At the end of this process, youth Dream Makers take on the mentoring role for new Dream Makers.

	 

	“Our community is honoured by these PAX Youth Dream Makers and their passion to their communities and youth across Manitoba and beyond,” said Chief Jim Tobacco, Mosakahiken Cree Nation, Swampy Cree Tribal Council. “PAX Youth Dream Makers represent our commitment to our children and youth, as referenced in the Swampy Cree Annual General Assembly, unanimous passing of resolution #2019-001 to support PAX, Opaskwayak Cree Nation, Aug. 7, 2019.”

	 

	Research has shown that students who participate in PAX do better in school and are more likely to graduate from high school. Participants need fewer special education services, have better mental health (including fewer suicidal thoughts/attempts), have fewer smoking, alcohol and drug addictions, and are less involved in crime into their adult years.

	 

	Recent outreach projects include:

	• led by Pukatawagan PAX Dream Makers, an event was held at the Opaskwayak Cree Nation mall, where PAX was taught to the community and youth displayed clothing they had designed to represent their culture and traditions;

	• led by Norway House PAX Dream Makers, mapping of safe mental health supports for youth in Norway House was conducted;

	• a community clean-up event in Pukatawagan was led by Pukatawagan PAX Dream Makers;

	• led by Chemawawin PAX Dream Makers, instruction for Indigenous youth from across Canada was provided to develop a vision for their home communities and how to make it happen at the Indspire conference; and

	• in the spirit of reconciliation, a First Nations PAX Dream Maker cohort, is mentoring the newest PAX cohort from the Rolling River School Division.

	 

	The investment in the PAX Dream Makers program aligns with recommendations made in the VIRGO report to expand mental health and addictions community outreach, promote and support the use of self-management tools, support the flexibility of community-based service delivery, expand services for children and youth, and ensure the use of evidence-based approaches.

	 

	The ministers noted that PAX Dream Makers also directly responds to several Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action including eliminating educational gaps between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians, and establishing community-based youth organizations to deliver programs on reconciliation. 

	 

	The investment in PAX Dream Makers builds on more than $33.7 million invested in 19 mental health and addictions projects, the ministers said.

PROVINCE DOUBLES ACCESS TO TAKE-HOME NALOXONE KITS


	The Manitoba government is investing up to $200,000 to double the access to naloxone kits, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today. 

	 

	“The COVID-19 pandemic has added extra stress to the daily life of all Manitobans and it is magnified in the lives of those at risk of an opioid overdose,” said Friesen. “They may be experiencing the effects of social distancing, self-isolation, changes to health-care service access, changing drug trends and increased stress responses. Allowing people to receive two kits at a time will reduce travel to naloxone distribution sites, increase resources in the community and help people address social distancing requirements.”

	 

	The minister noted the investment is part of the collaborative COVID-19 response to support people who are homeless, accessing shelters and using substances. This collaboration includes federal partners, regional health authorities and approximately 100 different community-based organizations that have come together to address a variety of issues including mental health and addictions in Manitoba. 

	 

	“Providing support for and addressing issues related to mental health and addictions remains our government’s priority,” said Friesen. “We’re committed to investing in projects, programs and services to support Manitobans living with a substance use disorder.”

	 

	Naloxone is used as an antidote to an opioid overdose. It temporarily reverses the life-threatening slowed breathing from an opioid overdose. 

	 

	In the first three months of 2020, more than 1,315 kits were sent to distribution sites.

	 

	As of Dec. 31, 2019, there were 104 take-home naloxone registered sites across the province including in all five health regions and in 27 First Nations. Between January 2017 and December 2019, 4,365 take-home naloxone kits were distributed to registered sites for people at risk of opioid overdose. 

	 

	From January 2017 to July 2019, there were 200 kits reported to have been used in the community during overdose events.

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED IN FORAGE INSURANCE REVIEW
					  Stakeholders Provided Valuable Input  Into Review: Pedersen


	After extensive engagement with the public, the Manitoba government released details of a review on forage insurance programs offered by the Manitoba Agricultural Services Corporation (MASC), Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	 

	“Regardless of the type of crop, producers are faced with tough decisions on what products make the most sense to help manage risk,” said Pedersen. “It is important to get feedback so that we have a clear picture of what products they need to support their success in the agricultural industry. We’re pleased with the input we received from the many invested stakeholders and look forward to making improvements to the program where possible.” 

	 

	The review was initiated to get a better understanding of the purchasing decisions of Manitoba producers in terms of forage insurance products available to them. 

	 

	Several key recommendations were made and immediate action items will be undertaken by MASC prior to the next insurance year. Some of which include:

	• exploring new methodologies to assign coverages to new insureds,

	• determining if the effect that disaster years have on future coverage can be minimized,

	• establishing insured values that better reflect the price of hay in claim years,

	• identifying areas where the administrative burden for insureds can be minimized,

	• reviewing the index-based insurance approach used in other jurisdictions which relies on weather or satellite-based technology, and

	• working more closely with industry to inform producers and increase awareness of the MASC Forage Insurance programs.

	 

	The review was conducted using a number of different methods, including the EngageMB portal, focus groups and interviews with producers, MASC insurance agents, agricultural specialists, industry associations, financial advisors, as well as other insurance providers.

	 

	More than 1,200 producers currently have forage insurance through MASC, insuring more than 272,000 acres. This represents about 18 per cent of the more than 1.5 million eligible acres of forage in Manitoba. 

	 

	The Forage Insurance program is part of AgriInsurance, a joint program of the Government of Canada and the Province of Manitoba under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership.

					  Upgrades to Important Economic Corridor will Help Support International Trade: Schuler


	The Manitoba government is investing more than $50 million on improvements to Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 between Winnipeg and the United States border this year, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	 

	“Highway 75 is a major north–south corridor that supports significant international trade,” said Schuler. “Investing in our highways supports economic growth and will have a positive impact on Manitoba’s economy for years to come.”

	 

	The Manitoba government is working on several projects this summer, including full concrete reconstruction or rehabilitation in some areas, intersection improvements, and one culvert replacement.

	 

	Projects currently underway include:

	• reconstruction of the northbound lanes from the United States border to Provincial Road (PR) 243;

	• intersection improvements at PR 243 including reconstructing PR 200 east of PTH 75; 

	• culvert replacement at Kronsgart Drain, 5.9 kilometres south of the junction of PTH 23; 

	• concrete repair projects at various southbound lane locations; and

	• concrete reconstruction in the northbound lanes from 6.6 km north of PTH 14 to 800 metres south of the junction at PTH 23.

	 

	Construction work north of PTH 14 also supports flood mitigation south of Morris by raising the elevation of the northbound lanes to 2009 flood levels.

	 

	The province is also planning to begin construction this summer to pave PR 246 from gravel to Road Transportation Association of Canada (RTAC) standards from PTH 23 near Morris to PR 205 near Aubigny. This will allow traffic to be rerouted around the sections of PTH 75 that are most prone to flood closure. In early June, the province announced it would invest $16 million to create a flood-proof alternate route to PTH 75. 

	 

	The minister also reminded motorists to lower their speed and drive with extra caution during summer construction season as it brings more workers to Manitoba roadways.

PROVINCE LAUNCHES INITIATIVE TO GET MANITOBA BACK TO WORK THIS SUMMER
					  Business Hiring Program Offers Incentive for Employers to Hire and Rehire Workers Post-Pandemic: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is launching a new hiring program to get more Manitobans back to work this summer and ease the road to economic recovery for businesses, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“We appreciate our many local businesses that temporarily closed their doors, reduced capacity or changed the way they operate in order to help flatten the COVID-19 curve and follow provincial public health orders,” said Pallister. “Those closures and changes come at a cost to businesses, and we want to ease their road to recovery by covering half the wages paid to designated employees over a period of up to 10 weeks this summer.”

	 

	The new ‘Manitoba Back to Work This Summer’ initiative is a hiring program to help Manitoba-based businesses rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. Employers can apply to receive funding for up to five employees hired or rehired after June 18. The program will reimburse 50 per cent of the total wages paid from June 18 until Aug. 30, to a maximum of $5,000 per worker and $25,000 per business.

	 

	“The reopening of our economy depends on businesses getting back up and running, and we encourage private-sector employers to bring back laid-off employees or take on new hires,” said Pallister. “The Manitoba Back to Work This Summer initiative provides financial flexibility to help businesses through this difficult time and address short-term challenges, while they build toward full capacity and long-term success.”

PROVINCE RELEASES FINAL PLAN FOR THIRD PHASE OF RESTORING SERVICES SAFELY
					  Efforts of `Team Manitoba' Enable Further Reopening of Businesses, Communities on June 21: Pallister

Watch news conference





	Following feedback from the public, the Manitoba government is releasing its plan to further ease public health restrictions and continue safely restoring services, effective June 21, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“Thanks to the efforts of all Manitobans and based on advice from our public health officials, I pleased to announce that we are in a position to move forward once again in our phased approach of restarting our economy,” said Pallister. “Thousands of Manitobans provided their input and feedback on numerous proposed measures for Phase Three of Restoring Safe Services, and their support for our plan to further ease public health restrictions is reflected in the next steps of our economic recovery roadmap.”

	 

	The premier noted more than 25,000 Manitobans participated in a public telephone town hall to ask questions, voice their concerns, support and feedback on the draft plan of Phase Three of Restoring Safe Services:  Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap for Recovery. As well, the province has received nearly 5,100 online submissions to https://EngageMB and over 32,000 responses on the school restart survey from parents and students. 

	 

	The final plan being released today is based on public health advice, consultation with key sectors and feedback from the public, the premier added.

	 

	Key changes made following public feedback include:

	• removing the maximum capacity of 300 people at any site provided the gathering can be physically divided into sub-groups of 50 or fewer indoors or 100 or fewer outdoors, to a maximum 30 per cent of usual capacity;

	• allowing people from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and people living in the area of the northwestern Ontario (west of Terrace Bay) to visit Manitoba without having to self-isolate for 14 days;

	• ensuring those travelling to northern Manitoba must continue to respect any restrictions that have been put in place by local communities and First Nations;

	• lifting self-isolation requirements on a case-by-case basis where sectors propose and provide satisfactory plans to address public health requirements for necessary travel; and

	• lifting capacity limits for restaurants, bars, beverage rooms, brew pubs, microbreweries and distilleries, as long as tables and seating are arranged so there is a temporary or physical barrier, or two metres of separation between people sitting at different tables.

	 

	Detailed information on the plan for Phase Three, including service restoration, measures the public can take to reduce their risk of COVID-19 exposure or spreading the virus, and workplace guidance for businesses, can be found at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices.

	 

	“Current indicators show the risk of community transmission of the virus in Manitoba is low at this time, so we are now able to further ease restrictions while ensuring Manitobans still practice the fundamentals that got us to this stage,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public heath officer. “As businesses and communities expand the services they offer, all Manitobans must continue to practise physical distancing with others outside their households, wash their hands often and stay home when they are sick to further reduce the risk of spreading the virus.” 

	 

	The province continues to encourage businesses to take steps to help staff, customers and visitors stay safe including:

	• ensuring people are able to reasonably maintain two metres of distance;

	• only conducting necessary and brief exchanges within two metres of others;

	• applying enhanced cleaning protocols, especially in common areas like washrooms;

	• maintaining physical distancing and food-handling protocols in workplace areas including lunch and common areas;

	• ensuring staff stay home when feeling sick; and

	• following personal risk reduction measures.

	 

	Since May 21, Manitobans have engaged over 124,000 times through online surveys and telephone town halls to provide feedback on the Restoring Safe Services roadmap and restarting schools. 

	 

	The premier also noted the province is developing a rapid response system to guide future decisions and any additional reopening steps that may be considered. Each level will include a risk assessment and a range of measures that may be in place at that level. As work continues to monitor the spread of the virus, the province may move up or down the rapid response/’stoplight’ scale as indicators change.

	 

	“While we can take pride in the progress we’ve made and the additional steps we are announcing today, we must remain vigilant,” said Pallister. “If public health results deteriorate or guidelines are not sufficient, Phase Three measures may be paused and previous measures may be reintroduced. I’m confident that we will continue to be successful if we keep working together as a team.”

	 

	The survey for the third phase and the plan to restart Manitoba schools will be open until June 21. Manitobans are encouraged to visit https://EngageMB to share their views.

					  Important Investments to Preserve Our Past For Future Generations: Cox


	The Manitoba government is investing more than $255,000 in grants to 50 Manitoba organizations through the Heritage Grants Program, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox announced today.

	 

	“Our government is pleased to invest in initiatives that will help community groups and organizations preserve pieces of Manitoba history to share with future generations,” said Cox. “It is important that we honour our past as we look to Manitoba’s bright and exciting future.”

This can include developing exhibitions, conserving or managing collections that are essential to the health of the organization and its holdings, and essential research.

	 

	Approved projects are expected to be unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, or can be easily adjusted to take physical distancing requirements into account. 

	 

	Grants range from just over $1,000 to more than $10,000, depending on the size and scope of the heritage projects, which include interpretive signs, murals, bilingual exhibits, book research and writing, a home movie archive, and digitization of sound recordings. Specific project details will be unveiled in the coming weeks.

PROVINCE EXPANDS $120-MILLION RISK RECOGNITION PROGRAM
					  Additional Front-line Workers to be Compensated for Risks Taken during COVID-19 Pandemic: Fielding


	Based on additional input from stakeholders, the Manitoba government is expanding its $120-million Risk Recognition program to include more front-line workers who were exposed to added risk during the COVID-19 pandemic, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	 

	“Stakeholder input is important to our government, and we extensively consulted Manitoba’s business community, trade and labour unions and essential service organizations to set up the Risk Recognition program and determine who would qualify,” said Fielding. “We recently invited stakeholders to provide additional feedback on how to expand the program and compensate more workers for their roles to support all Manitobans during the pandemic.” 

	 

	The province announced the $120-million Manitoba Risk Recognition Program in mid-May following stakeholder consultations. Stakeholders comprised 15 unions, critical service providers and business community organizations that represent more than 17,000 businesses and 110,000 workers.

	 

	The payment is available to part-time and full-time employees in various public- and private-sector positions that include the areas of health care, social services, justice, transportation, food and beverage, and essential retail. Essential workers must have worked a minimum 200 cumulative hours (or would have worked that amount but were required to self-isolate under public health orders) from March 20 to May 29. 

	 

	To expand the program, the province once again solicited input from the stakeholder group. A majority of stakeholders voted to increase the qualifying threshold to a total pre-tax employment income of less than $5,000 per month, or $12,500 total during the 2.5-month eligibility period, and exclude overtime from the total gross income calculation. 

	 

	The program has also been expanded to include the following positions: 

	• hotel workers (reception, cleaners, maintenance, kitchen staff, servers, security); and

	• Business Improvement Zone staff (patrol, graffiti removal, street cleaners, distributors of COVID-19-related education material and Personal Protective Equipment).

	 

	“By increasing eligible positions and income limits, and excluding overtime earnings, we will ensure the program continues to support lower- to middle-income workers and recognizes those who may have otherwise worked themselves out of qualifying through overtime,” said Fielding. “Manitoba’s program continues to reflect the federal government’s intention of this cost-sharing program to recognize low-income Canadian workers who risked their own health to provide crucial services.”

	 

	The minister is encouraging all eligible workers to apply for the program and view the full list of positions at https://manitoba.ca/covid19/infomanitobans/mrrp.html. 

	 

	The province has extended the application deadline until Monday, June 29 at noon. It will issue payment via direct deposit once it verifies applications and plans to fully distribute the $120-million fund. As the fund will be divided equally between all successful applicants, the number of program participants will determine individual payments.

STANDING HEARING FOR INQUEST INTO DEATH OF MACHUAR MADUT


	A standing hearing will take place to determine who can participate in the upcoming inquest into the death of Machuar Madut, 43, of Winnipeg.

	 

	On Feb. 23, 2019, Winnipeg police responded to a 911 call regarding an unknown male breaking in to a suite at 182 Colony St. armed with a hammer. Upon arrival, officers located Madut in the building and confirmed that he matched the description police had been provided. While police attempted to arrest Madut, he ran into a suite and was pursued by officers. Police deployed their conducted energy devices with no effect. Madut armed himself with a hammer and charged at police. Shots were fired and Madut sustained gunshot wounds. He was transported by ambulance to the Health Sciences Centre, where he was pronounced deceased.

	 

	Under The Fatality Inquiries Act, an inquest has been called by the chief medical examiner. Inquests explore the circumstances and events leading to deaths for the purpose of finding out what, if anything, might be done to prevent similar deaths in the future.

	 

	Before the inquest begins, the judge will decide who can participate in the process and question witnesses. Individuals and groups may make an application to be granted standing and participate in the inquest. Those interested in applying for standing should contact Jay L. Funke, inquest counsel, at 204-239-3344 or jay.funke@gov.mb.ca by the end of the day on June 29.

	 

	The standing hearing will be held in Winnipeg on July 13 at 2 p.m. in courtroom 403 at the Manitoba Law Courts Complex, 408 York Ave.

PROVINCE OPENS ONLINE INTAKE FOR NON-PROFIT SUMMER STUDENT INCENTIVE GRANT
					  $6,000 in Additional Support Available to Charities and Non-Profit Organizations that Hire Summer Students: Pallister


	The Manitoba government has opened its online intake for the Non-Profit Summer Student Incentive Grant so charities and non-profit organizations can apply to receive additional financial assistance, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“Our government recognizes the important work charities and non-profit organizations do to build healthier and stronger communities right across the province, as well as the opportunity they have to help stimulate job creation for thousands of students,” said Pallister. “As we continue to ease restrictions and restore our services, charities and non-profits can play a vital role in our province’s pandemic recovery efforts, while providing valuable work experience for Manitoba students.” 

	 

	The new Non-Profit Summer Student Incentive Grant is now available to eligible charities and non-profit organizations that apply for the Summer Student Recovery Jobs Program. The grant will provide an additional $6,000 to approved applicants that hire at least one full-time equivalent student under the jobs program for at least eight weeks, with $3,000 paid upfront and the remainder paid out at the end of summer employment. 

	 

	Organizations are also eligible for up to $25,000 in support to hire up to five summer students aged 15 to 29 under the Manitoba Summer Student Recovery Program, which is a critical part of the provincial pandemic response, the premier noted. The program provides private and not-for-profit, charitable sector employers a $7 per hour wage subsidy for each student hired, to a maximum of $5,000. In addition to working in traditional summer roles, students can help organizations and businesses adapt their workplaces and public spaces to the public health requirements of COVID-19 this year.  

	 

	“Students can provide valuable assistance to non-profit and charitable organizations across Manitoba, and in turn receive critical work experience to build their careers and help to finance their educational pursuits,” said Pallister. “Through the combination of the new Non-Profit Summer Student Incentive Grant and the Summer Student Recovery Jobs Program, eligible organizations can access up to $31,000 in provincial government supports this summer.”  

	 

	The province has created a single access portal to streamline the application process for both the Non-Profit Summer Student Incentive Grant and Manitoba Summer Student Recovery Program. Charities or non-profit organizations that have already applied for the Manitoba Summer Student Recovery Jobs Program do not need to reapply and provincial staff will reach out to those organizations to confirm interest in the grant.

	 

	The application form and list of eligibility criteria is available online at:

www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/summerstudentjobprogram.html. 

	 

	Those who require assistance to complete the online form can contact the Manitoba Economic Support Centre (toll-free) at 1-888-805-7554.

	 

	Since the province launched the Manitoba Summer Student Recovery Program April 24, more than 1,300 employers have applied for nearly $15 million in supports for nearly 3,000 student positions. 

	 

	Pallister noted charities, non-profits and other employers with positions available for students can also connect with more than 5,800 students through the recently launched Student Jobs MB online tool. Students and employers can use the easy online matching tool at https://studentjobsmb.ca. More than 360 employers have already posted approximately 700 jobs and are finding qualified applicants daily.

	The Manitoba government is celebrating the achievements of athletes, coaches and families as part of Special Olympics Manitoba Awareness Week, Families Minister Heather Stefanson and Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox announced today.

	 

	“It was an honour to initially introduce legislation to celebrate the achievements of Manitoba’s Special Olympics athletes,” said Stefanson. “This week is an important opportunity for all Manitobans to commit to inclusiveness for people with intellectual disabilities, year-round. Just as this year’s theme highlights, we must all accept each other with no exception.”

	 

	In 2013, the province officially began recognizing the second week in June as Special Olympics Manitoba Awareness Week. This year, Special Olympics Manitoba Awareness Week runs from June 14 to 20 on the theme of ‘Accept With No Exception’.

	 

	“Sport brings all of us together,” said Cox. “Through the commitment of athletes, coaches, family members and other supporters, Manitobans with intellectual disabilities have built a community focused on excellence and personal development, as well as the spirit of friendly competition.”

	 

	“This week recognizes the incredible dedication of our athletes and our broader mission of promoting respect and inclusion for people with an intellectual disability through sport,” said Jennifer Campbell, chief executive officer, Special Olympics Manitoba. “This year’s theme reminds us that all Manitobans benefit from inclusion. We can achieve more together when everyone is accepted and included.”

	 

	The ministers noted the province provides annual funding to Special Olympics Manitoba through Sport Manitoba, including more than $117,000 last year. 

	 

	During Special Olympics Manitoba Awareness Week, youth and adult athletes can participate in a virtual competition to showcase their skills in a variety of exercises that are easy to do at home.  For more information on the competitions, Special Olympics Manitoba and other special events happening this week, visit www.specialolympics.mb.ca.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT PROVIDES UPDATE ON STUDENT SUMMER EMPLOYMENT
					  Provincial Supports Encourage Employers to Hire Students to Help with Manitoba's Economic Recovery: Eichler


	The Manitoba government is reminding employers of the various supports available to hire students to help rebuild the provincial economy, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.  

	 

	“Students play an important role in Manitoba’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Eichler. “The Student Summer Jobs Recovery Program is providing a wage subsidy for employers and helping create thousands of jobs for students this summer. We want to encourage more employers to take this opportunity as we move toward Phase Three of the government’s Restoring Safe Services plan.” 

	 

	Eichler provided an update on the Student Summer Jobs Recovery Program, which launched April 24. Since then, more than 1,300 employers have applied for $14.8 million in supports for nearly 3,000 student positions with numbers consistently climbing daily.

	 

	The Student Summer Jobs Recovery Program assists private and non-profit employers to hire students to help meet organizational needs during the pandemic. Organizations can apply for up to $25,000 in support to hire up to five summer students aged 15 to 29. The program provides a $7 per hour wage subsidy for each student hired, to a maximum of $5,000. In addition to working in traditional summer roles, students can help organizations and businesses adapt their workplaces and public spaces to the public health requirements of COVID-19 this year.  

	 

	The minister also shared the latest numbers from the Student Jobs MB online tool. The province launched this simple, free-to-use app May 28 for students to apply for and match with multiple jobs in all sectors. To date, more than 5,800 students have registered. More than 360 employers have posted approximately 700 available jobs for students.

	 

	“Students have indicated interest in areas such as retail, food and beverage, construction and the not-for-profit sector, all of which are ramping up operations as we restore services across the province,” said Eichler. “Many employers have work to do, and many students are looking for work experience and opportunities to develop their skills. Employers are finding qualified applicants daily through Student Jobs MB, and we hope to continue this pace of growth and make 2020 a banner year for student employment.”

	 

	To promote awareness of the suite of employment supports available, including those for students, the Manitoba Economic Support Centre has made 136,000 contacts with businesses, charities, not-for-profit and community organizations and fielded more than 16,000 calls.

	 

	In the coming days, the province will launch a further direct outreach campaign to encourage employers in the private and not-for-profit sectors to hire students. It will engage a team of post-secondary students to lead the campaign, and utilize both traditional and modern outreach strategies to increase student hiring. The students will also contribute to broader strategies to support continued student hiring into the fall and winter months.

	The Manitoba government has partnered with community-based organizations to deliver nutritious food and family-friendly recipes to about 6,000 children in pilot sites across the province, supported by new online resources to help all Manitoba families learn more about nutrition and meal preparation together, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	 

	“Our government believes that nutritious food and meal preparation can bring families closer together, and this investment will provide that opportunity to thousands of children and families experiencing food disruption because of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Stefanson. “Through the Home Nutrition and Learning Pilot Program, we will connect thousands of children and their families with nutritious food, family-focused recipes and learning activities over the coming months.” 

	 

	In keeping with the Manitoba government’s commitment to working with community-based organizations, the $2.5-million pilot program will be delivered by:

	• Andrews Street Family Centre Inc. in Winnipeg;

	• Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre Inc. in Winnipeg;

	• Samaritan House in Brandon; 

	• Food Matters Manitoba in the community of Cross Lake; and

	• Bayline Regional Round Table in Thicket Portage, Pikwitonei, Ilford/War Lake and Wabowden.

	 

	The minister noted these organizations will build on their existing relationships with families and community networks to deliver a successful pilot program. In many cases, they have been providing emergency food items as part of the community response to COVID-19, but the pilot program will allow them to provide additional nutritious foods to families built around menus, recipes and educational activities.  

	 

	“Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre provides basic emergency food kits to hundreds of low-income families every week, and this investment will help us provide more nutritious foods to children and families in need,” said Diane Redsky, executive director, Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre. “We are very grateful for the province’s substantial investment, and we look forward to the direct and meaningful impacts this investment will have in the lives of our children and families.”

	 

	“Andrews Street Family Centre has been providing 120 to 150 hot lunches to our community since COVID-19 began, and this pilot program will allow the centre to support another 50 to 60 families with nutritious food, learning material and menus,” said Dilly Knol, executive director, Andrews Street Family Centre. “Learning to cook together as a family through this pilot program may introduce different foods that families might not have purchased in the past. We hope this will lead to families buying and preparing more nutritious food together.” 

	 

	Participating families will receive packages of healthy foods along with recipes and learning activities that have been developed by the Child Nutrition Council of Manitoba. These educational resources will also be available online at a new website for all Manitobans, to support families as they spend time together learning about food, nutrition and meal preparation.

	 

	“Learning to cook at home is an invaluable life skill,” said Stefanson. “Reading a recipe, measuring ingredients and making food together at home encourages literacy, numeracy and many other skills. We hope the Home Nutrition and Learning Pilot Program will provide parents with additional opportunities to connect with their children in a fun, shared activity.”

	 

	The pilot program will launch in Winnipeg this week and in other communities in early July, running until the end of September in all locations. The community partners will use their connections with families who have school-aged children and are experiencing food disruption to invite them to participate in the pilot program. Community partners will also let families know how their packages will be provided, as this will vary by pilot site.

	 

	The minister noted this pilot program is part of the Manitoba Protection Plan, a government-wide initiative to support Manitobans affected by COVID-19. 

	 

	Manitobans are encouraged to visit www.manitoba.ca/nutritionlearningprogram to learn more about the pilot program and to explore the available resources and learning activities.

PROVINCE HIGHLIGHTS MANITOBA ACCESS AWARENESS WEEK
					  Webinar to Focus on Accessible Employment and Customer Service During Pandemic: Stefanson


	The Manitoba government is highlighting accessibility issues affecting people with disabilities, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of Manitoba Access Awareness Week (MAAW), Families Minister Heather Stefanson, minister responsible for accessibility, announced today.

	 

	“Accessibility is a priority for our government and it must be a priority for all Manitobans, because we all benefit when people with disabilities are fully included,” said Stefanson. “The pandemic has highlighted some of the barriers facing people with disabilities, particularly in the workforce and as consumers. I encourage all Manitobans to join the conversation about accessibility issues this week to learn more about what we can do together to address and eliminate these challenges.”

	 

	MAAW runs from June 14 to 20 and the focus this year is accessible employment and customer service during COVID-19. A free webinar will be co-hosted by the province’s Disabilities Issues Office (DIO), the Manitoba Employment Equity Practitioners Association (MEEPA) and Manitoba Possible on June 18 from 2 to 3 p.m., featuring remarks from the minister as well as the launch of a new training video focused on accessibility in the workplace.  Other topics will include:

	• accessibility during COVID-19 including employee safety, new accessibility requirements and accessing goods and services; 

	• how to ensure an inclusive workplace by meeting Manitoba’s newest accessibility standard for employment; 

	• tips, tools and resources for accessible employment and customer service; and

	• accessibility challenges and success stories during COVID-19. 

	 

	“We must all continue to take steps to ensure we are increasing accessibility for all our employees and customers,” said Marilyn Funk, co-chair, MEEPA. “During COVID-19, MEEPA reminds employers to consider both visible and invisible health conditions, like a compromised immune system, that may affect employees’ return to more regular operations. We are pleased to co-host the webinar to provide a focus on these important accessibility issues.” 

	 

	“We all benefit when businesses are willing to be flexible with employees and in how they offer their goods and services,” said Dana Erickson, CEO, Manitoba Possible. “For instance, Manitobans with disabilities and many others appreciate home delivery and virtual consultations as a way to create access, while maintaining social distance.”

	 

	To register for the webinar, visit https://maaw2020accessiblemb.eventbrite.ca. Manitobans can also join the conversation about MAAW on social media by using #MAAW2020 and #AccessibleMB.  The province has developed a social media kit focused on MAAW and accessibility issues for individuals, community organizations and businesses. To download these resources, visit the DIO website at www.accessibilitymb.ca. 

	 

	New provisions under the province’s accessibility standard for employment came into effect for all organizations on May 1. Focused on employee safety, these provisions require all employers to have an emergency response plan for employees with disabilities and to develop a process to share information about individuals who may need help during an emergency with those who can provide assistance. Other provisions under the accessibility standard for employment will be phased in over the next two years. 

	 

	The minister noted the province provided $200 to lower-income Manitobans with disabilities last month to help address some of the financial challenges caused by COVID-19, as part of its expanded Manitoba Protection Plan. For more information on the $4.6-million Disability Economic Support Program, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19/infomanitobans/desp.html.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	More than $2.1 million will be invested to provide more community-based trauma services for newcomers and refugees suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	 

	“Many newcomers to Manitoba have experienced trauma that may significantly impact their new lives in Canada,” said Friesen. “This funding will provide access to ongoing counselling, psychological and psychiatric care to ensure newcomers have the supports they need to heal and build a strong future.”

	 

	The investment, to be spread over three years, will be used to create a collaborative and interdisciplinary, community-based newcomer trauma team. The team will serve refugees and other immigrants, and include expertise and services from Shared Health, the Aurora Family Therapy Centre, Family Dynamics and Immigration Partnership Winnipeg as well as staff from Manitoba Adolescent Treatment Centre and the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. 

	 

	“This meaningful investment will make it easier for newcomers and refugees to access mental health services, heal from their trauma and lead productive lives,” said John Smyth, executive director, Aurora Family Therapy Centre. “We thank the Manitoba government for supporting such a unique and progressive approach to helping these communities.”

	 

	Improved supports for newcomers with severe trauma will contribute to positive health and social outcomes. That includes reduced child welfare involvement, readiness for employment, reduced justice involvement and reduced gang-related activity.

	 

	“Improving access to mental health programming will increase the likelihood that newcomers to our province can make a positive contribution,” said Justice Minister Cliff Cullen. “This investment will help those accessing these services make the right decisions, which will reduce crime rates in our communities.”

	 

	This investment fulfils a recommendation made in the VIRGO report, which was to enhance and accelerate supports to deal with community-based substance use, addictions and mental health issues for newcomers and refugees, with a focus on post-trauma care. 

	 

	Funding for these initiatives is being provided under the Canada-Manitoba Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement. In the past eight months, the Manitoba government has committed $33.7 million toward 19 initiatives to improve mental health and addictions services throughout the province.

ADDITIONAL COVID-19 TESTING TO OFFER RAPID RESULTS FOR NORTHERN MANITOBA PATIENTS


	A federal-provincial partnership is bringing rapid-response COVID-19 testing to northern Manitoba, ensuring patients at higher risk of transmitting the virus are able to quickly access their results.

	 

	The Public Health Agency of Canada and the Manitoba First Nation Pandemic Response Co-ordination Team, in partnership with the First Nations Inuit Health Branch, have deployed four GeneXpert machines to be used by health-care providers in Thompson, The Pas, Norway House Cree Nation and the Percy E. Moore Hospital at Peguis First Nation, to supplement COVID-19 testing already being conducted at facilities throughout Manitoba’s north. The GeneXpert machine, which can provide test results in as little an hour, is already used in a number of Canadian jurisdictions to test for infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and influenza.

	 

	“As part of our response to COVID-19, we continue to work closely with provinces and territories to prevent the spread of the virus. The Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory deployed the machines into these remote communities and will continue to provide COVID-19 testing support to them,” said Patty Hajdu, Canada’s Minister of Health.

	 

	“Measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within northern communities have been a high priority since efforts to fight this virus within our province began several months ago,” said Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen. “This new equipment has the capability to provide a COVID-19 test result in about an hour and will be used to quickly confirm the presence of the virus in those patients who may require additional support to self-isolate.” 

	 

	Health-care providers will use the GeneXpert test kits for patients who may not be able to self-isolate easily if they test positive and therefore pose a higher risk of transmitting the virus. These may include patients who are experiencing multiple symptoms associated with COVID-19 or have other factors that put them at greater risk of contracting the virus. Northern Manitoba patients who do not fall within one of these categories will continue to follow the established process, which includes transport to Cadham and Dynacare labs for COVID-19 testing.

	 

	“Residents throughout the north are to be commended for their vigilance in preventing the spread of this virus in our region,” said Dr. Michael Isaac, medical officer of health for the Northern Regional Health Authority. “Targeted rapid-response testing provides public health officials with another tool that will help us quickly suppress the spread of the virus if and when it reappears in our region.” 

	 

	The first three GeneXpert machines have been installed. Two are located at hospitals operated by Indigenous Services Canada in Norway House Cree Nation and Peguis First Nation, and one is on loan to Shared Health for operation at Thompson General Hospital. A fourth machine, destined for St. Anthony’s General Hospital in The Pas, is expected to be operational in the coming weeks.

	 

	GeneXpert is a product manufactured in the United States and Canada receives a limited supply of devices based on the high demand for this product. As additional devices, cartridges and the necessary testing becomes available, phased expansion of GeneXpert testing can be considered on a broader scale.

	 

	Since the beginning of the pandemic, a number of northern-specific initiatives have been launched to protect residents in Northern Manitoba from the spread of COVID-19 including travel restrictions and the opening of community testing sites in Thompson, Flin Flon and The Pas. To date, three people living in northern Manitoba had tested positive for COVID-19. All three have since recovered. There have been no cases of COVID-19 involving people living on-reserve in Manitoba First Nations.

					  We Must Remain Vigilant,  We do not Want a COVID Comeback: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is seeking feedback from the public on its proposed plan to ease public health restrictions and continue safely restoring services, while ensuring physical distancing, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“Thanks to the efforts of ‘Team Manitoba’, we have successfully kept our COVID curve flat and continue to have among the lowest test positivity rates in Canada,” said Pallister. “There is a lot to take into consideration as we reopen our businesses and communities, safely. I am pleased to share with Manitobans the draft plan for Phase Three of Restoring Safe Services, and I encourage their input and advice as we move forward in our recovery efforts, together.”

	 

	The draft plan for Phase Three of reopening the Manitoba economy is based on public health advice and consultation with key sectors. Proposed measures include:

	• increasing gathering sizes to up to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors;

	• developing guidelines for faith-based and other cultural gatherings, pow wows and other Indigenous cultural and spiritual gatherings, and small summer fairs and festivals;

	• easing border restrictions to allow residents of western Canada and northwest Ontario to enter Manitoba without the need to self-isolate for 14 days;

	• resuming regular licensed capacity for child-care centres with guidelines in place;

	• increasing group sizes for day camps from 24 children to 50;

	• increasing indoor occupancy levels for community/service centres and senior centres/clubs;

	• allowing people employed by or affiliated with a film production to enter Manitoba without 

	self-isolating for 14 days;

	• allowing people employed by or affiliated with a professional sports team to enter Manitoba without self-isolating for 14 days;

	• removing occupancy limits for retail businesses while ensuring physical distancing measures are in place;

	• increasing indoor and patio occupancy limits to 75 per cent of total capacity for restaurants, bars, beverage rooms, brew pubs, microbreweries and distilleries; and

	• lifting occupancy limits for regulated and non-regulated health professions including registered massage therapists.

	 

	Detailed information on the plan for Phase Three, including service restoration, measures the public can take to reduce their risk of COVIC-19 exposure or spreading the virus, and workplace guidance for businesses, can be found at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices.

	 

	“As we reopen the economy, we will have to adjust to some level of risk and each person has to decide the level of risk they are willing to accept,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public heath officer. “All Manitobans, especially those choosing to resume some activities, must remember to practise good hand hygiene, not to share items with others and practise physical distancing when with others outside their households.” 

	 

	Roussin also noted it is key for people to stay home if they are sick to further reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

	 

	The province continues to encourage businesses to take steps to help staff, customers and visitors stay safe including:

	• ensuring people are able to reasonably maintain two metres of distance;

	• only conducting necessary and brief exchanges within two metres of others;

	• applying enhanced cleaning protocols, especially in common areas like washrooms;

	• maintaining physical distancing and food-handling protocols in workplace areas including lunch and common areas;

	• ensuring staff stay home when feeling sick; and

	• following personal risk reduction measures.

	 

	“While we can take pride in the progress we’ve made and the additional steps we are considering today, we must remain vigilant,” Pallister said. “If public health results deteriorate or guidelines are not sufficient, Phase Three measures may be paused and previous measures may be re-introduced. We do not want a COVID comeback, we want a Manitoba comeback.”

					  Road Safety, Municipal Water and Waste Projects Will Help Restart Manitoba's Economy After COVID-19 Pandemic: Pallister


Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is making a number of investments to improve provincial infrastructure and safeguard the well-being of Manitobans and their communities, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“As Manitoba is now in a position to slowly and carefully restart our economy as we move forward through the COVID-19 pandemic, these investments will help ramp up the construction industry and create opportunities to bring more Manitobans back to work,” said Pallister. “These shovel-worthy infrastructure investments reflect municipal priorities, and will improve the safety and well-being of our communities today and well into the future.”

	 

	Today, Pallister revealed which projects will be funded through the $500-million Manitoba Restart Program, which was announced May 7 to help boost the provincial economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The economic stimulus package adds an additional $500 million above the $3-billion infrastructure investment in Budget 2020. 

	 

	Projects selected include pre-existing provincial and municipal priorities, and waste and water projects. The $500 million will be allocated over two years as follows:

	• $230 million earmarked for the provincial share of projects under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP), a cost-sharing, application-based program with the federal government;

	• $150 million for asphalt highway resurfacing;

	• $50 million for the Water Services Board to address the significant backlog of water and sewer projects across Manitoba;

	• $65 million for major projects that will improve the safety of Manitoba’s highways; and 

	• $5 million on municipal law enforcement priorities including local jails to alleviate pressure on the Winnipeg Remand Centre.

	 

	Pallister noted project goals include increasing clean drinking water, reducing boil water advisories and advancing clean sewer projects. The province will reveal further details of its prioritized ICIP project applications in the weeks and months ahead as it works with other levels of government and Indigenous partners, and it will use the $230 million set aside for ICIP to leverage additional dollars through federal and municipal government sharing. 

	 

	Once Ottawa approves final ICIP projects, the premier noted the province is prepared to immediately advance funds to municipal partners to allow planning and construction to commence without delay. Other construction projects announced today, such as highways and Water Services Board projects, will be put out to tender in the coming weeks.

	 

	The premier also announced today, as part of the initial $3 billion worth of infrastructure investments in Budget 2020, the province has allocated $91 million in total capital investment on construction improvements to the Trans-Canada Highway (PTH 1) across Manitoba. Projects include: 

	• road reconstruction on the westbound lanes from the Brokenhead River to PTH 11;

	• road reconstruction on the eastbound lanes from Provincial Road (PR) 248 to the east junction of PTH 26;

	• road rehabilitation on the eastbound lanes from 3.4 kilometres west of PTH 83 to PR 257; and

	• structure replacement at the Assiniboine River 13.2 km east of Portage la Prairie.

	 

	“Our number one priority is to ensure the health and well-being of all Manitobans, and we are working to make the Trans-Canada Highway safer from border to border,” said Pallister. “Investments in Highway 1 help ensure the safe and continued movement of people and economic goods across the province. We are also rejuvenating and planting additional shelterbelts to help improve safety and reduce road closures between Portage la Prairie and Winnipeg.” 

	 

	Pallister announced the province is providing up to $2.5 million in funding for Trans-Canada Shelterbelt Renewal Project through the Growing Outcomes in Watersheds (GROW) Trust program. The province is working with the Manitoba Habitat Heritage Corporation (MHHC) to restore and add to 16 km of shelterbelts on the north side of the Trans-Canada Highway from St. François Xavier to Elie, and west of the PTH 430 intersection. 

	 

	“It is exciting to take on a project that uses trees to directly protect the well-being of Manitobans,” said Tim Sopuck, chief executive officer, MHHC. “These shelterbelts will also sequester carbon and help to slow spring run-off.” 

	 

	The project will plant approximately 20,000 new trees and shrubs, sourced from Manitoba nurseries, and employ a Manitoba tree-planting company. The project, expected to be complete in 2022, will be one of Canada’s largest road-related shelterbelt planting initiatives.

PROVINCE ADDS 70 SUPPORTIVE RECOVERY HOUSING UNITS
					  Investment Expands Access to Support Counselling and Recovery Programming: Friesen

Background Information

Watch news conference





	Siloam Mission, Riverwood Church Community Inc. and Tamarack Recovery Inc. will receive $2.1 million in funding from the Manitoba government to develop 70 supportive recovery housing units, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today. 

	 

	“When people are completing their addictions treatment, they need access to stable housing and a safe place to live,” said Friesen. “The investment in these organizations will help support people as they transition back into the community after completing treatment programs, helping them continue their recovery journey.”

	 

	Supportive recovery housing provides a stable environment for adults who have completed their primary addictions treatment, reducing the likelihood of relapse. The organization offering the housing also provides ongoing support for tenants to fulfil their post-treatment plan including gaining employment or going back to school. Currently there are only seven organizations providing supportive long-term programs in Manitoba to approximately 174 individuals annually.

	 

	“We are grateful to the Province of Manitoba for helping to fund the 20 supportive recovery units in our old office space at 300 Princess,” said Jim Bell, CEO of Siloam Mission. “This endeavour fits in perfectly with the mental health programs and the other services we offer, and will enable us to help more people transition back into community.”

	 

	The province will provide financing for one-time capital costs and operating funding. Siloam Mission will develop 20 units, Riverwood Church Community Inc. will develop 40 units at Riverwood House in Elmwood and Tamarack Recovery Inc. will develop 10 units.

	 

	The organizations were selected based on submissions issued last fall, which focus on expanding system capacity for rehabilitative supports in both urban and rural areas, and address the increasing demand for services.

	 

	“The Riverwood House Project Team is grateful for the vision the province has to find creative solutions, and we are committed to seeing this investment provide much-needed housing and supports to empower people to move toward full recovery and healthy integration into the community,” said Jon Courtney with Riverwood House.

	 

	The $2.1-million investment will allow the organizations to develop program-based housing solutions providing on-site support services with a goal of all units being operational by March 31, 2021. 

	 

	“This exciting opportunity means that we can expand our efforts to serve Manitobans seeking long-term recovery from addictions by providing tailored transitional housing support for individuals during the critical post-treatment period in a safe, welcoming and supportive environment,” said Lisa Cowan, executive director, Tamarack Recovery Centre.

	 

	Studies show supportive recovery housing is an effective option for those in need of alcohol and drug-free housing accommodations, and improves success rates for addictions treatment. 

	 

	Recommendations from the VIRGO and the Illicit Drug Task Force reports both identify the need to add supportive recovery housing units to help meet demand for the service. Funding will be provided through the Canada-Manitoba Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement. 

	 

	The minister noted the government has invested more than $31.6 million to improve access to mental health and addictions treatment including $3.5 million for the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre, an investment to expand Project 11, and a pilot project to provide mental health and addictions services to families at risk of child apprehension.

	 

	“We are pleased to work in collaboration with community partners to directly support those recovering from addictions,” said Friesen. “We will continue to build on our front-line services to ensure access to needed addictions treatment and health-care services in Manitoba.”

STATEMENT FROM JUSTICE MINISTER CLIFF CULLEN ON PROVINCIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM


backgrounder
Background Information


	Our government always works closely with our policing partners to help protect the safety and well-being of all Manitobans.

	 

	Shortly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and following the advice of public health professionals, Manitoba Justice brought forward changes to allow us to properly screen and medically segregate new admissions at the Winnipeg Remand Centre. These changes required teamwork from a wide variety of our partners within the criminal justice system and were accomplished in a very short period of time.

	 

	The Winnipeg Police Service and Brandon Police Service played a key role in implementing these revised procedures, and we thank them for their efforts during these challenging times. There has not been a single case of COVID-19 in our Manitoba correctional facilities to date, and we are appreciative of all the modifications that our justice staff and police agencies have made in response to the pandemic.

	 

	Not only did these swift measures protect our staff and inmates from a COVID outbreak, they also brought us in line with procedures in virtually every other Canadian jurisdiction. These changes ensure that people have appeared before a judicial officer prior to admission to a provincial correctional facility, which is how the process works in all other provinces.

	 

	All divisions of Manitoba Justice are committed to working with the Winnipeg Police Service to support them in their responsibilities as the arresting agency and we will continue to work to ensure that no one remains in police custody longer than necessary.

	 

	While our government flows more than $200 million annually to Manitoba’s police agencies, including nearly $20 million for the Winnipeg Police Service, we also support public safety through a wide variety of community-based measures, some of which were announced as recently as this week. 

	 

	On Monday, we announced an investment of nearly $3 million in the Thompson Sobering Centre, the latest in a series of this government’s investments to meet better the needs of Manitobans struggling with mental health and addiction concerns. Since October 2019, our government has announced 18 initiatives valued at more than $31.6 million to improve mental health and addictions services throughout Manitoba. 

	 

	We have invested approximately $1 million into Community Mobilization hubs that help connect social service professionals and community agencies with at-risk youth and families to ensure they are receiving appropriate and timely supports and interventions. 

	 

	Our government has also made significant investments in restorative justice initiatives, helping divert more than 5,000 matters out of the criminal justice system to be resolved through restorative justice and diversion programs. 

	 

	We have increased by $400,000 support for restorative justice programming, and in March, I was proud to launch ‘Restorative Justice North’, a pilot project in partnership with the Manitoba Metis Federation and Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak.  

	 

	While we have already made some progress, we recognize there is more work ahead, and we will continue to invest in these important supports to help protect the safety and well-being of Manitobans.

MANITOBA INVESTING $750,000 FOR HERITAGE RESOURCE CONSERVATION GRANTS
					  New Program Triples Province's Support for Heritage Sites: Minister


	BRANDON—Manitoba Heritage Resource Conservation grants totalling $750,000 have been awarded to more than 80 projects from community groups, volunteer organizations and heritage organizations, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox announced today.

	 

	“We are pleased to be able to invest in so many community projects right across our great province in the first round of funding that triples government support for Manitoba’s designated heritage sites,” Cox said. “We live, work and play in these wonderful structures every day and preserving pieces of our past becomes even more important as we encourage Manitobans to help keep our COVID-19 curve flat by staying within Manitoba and exploring the beauty right here in our own backyard. We need to maintain these historic structures to help future generations learn about our province’s rich and diverse history.”

	 

Our Way Forward: Manitoba’s Culture Policy and Action Plan prioritizes supporting culture in communities and everyday life in addition to modernizing cultural funding programs. The Heritage Resource Conservation Trust was established in 2019 through a $15-million contribution to The Winnipeg Foundation. The annual resources from the endowment fund will ensure that heritage conservation projects are supported in perpetuity. 

	 

	One of the projects receiving funding is the historic Fraser Block in Brandon, with a grant totalling nearly $22,000 to help with repairs to the building, including the sandstone façade, the minister said. Built in 1890, the Fraser Block was one of the first substantial business buildings outside Winnipeg and it helped Brandon’s early advancement as a commercial centre. 

	 

	“We are thankful the Province of Manitoba recognizes the importance of preserving heritage buildings because these structures are a visible reminder of our collective past as Manitobans,” said Robyn Sneath, president of the Sneath Group. “By locating our business in a heritage building in Brandon's historic downtown, our goal is to create a unique destination experience for Manitobans, one that blends the past with the present.”  

	 

	The majority of program receiving investments through the Heritage Resource Conservation Trust target repairs and upgrades, but also include research and building assessments. Grants range from several hundred dollars up to $25,000, depending on the size and scope of the project. Additional projects will be announced in the coming weeks, the minister added.

	 

	The Heritage Resources Conservation Grant supports projects that demonstrate a commitment toward the conservation and long-term sustainability of heritage resources that are legally protected under The Heritage Resources Act. Categories for grant application include capital projects, research, conservation planning, education or training, and endowments.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES $2.8 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR CITY OF THOMPSON TO ESTABLISH SOBERING CENTRE


Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is providing $2.8 million to the City of Thompson to establish and operate a sobering centre, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	 

	“Sobering centres offer an effective alternative to police and hospital-based responses to public intoxication, while keeping Manitobans safe,” said Cullen. “This centre will provide a safe setting for individuals needing short-term recovery.”

	 

	Public intoxication continues to be a significant health and public safety issue in Thompson, with over 2,000 detentions under The Intoxicated Persons Detention Act (IPDA) in 2019. IPDA calls put a significant burden on Thompson’s RCMP detachment, as well as local health-care facilities.

	 

	The Thompson Sobering Centre will provide a 24-7 safe and secure environment for non-violent, publicly intoxicated individuals to stay while the effects of drugs and/or alcohol wear off. 

	 

	“The new sobering centre is a central part to the Main Street North project,” said Mayor Colleen Smook, City of Thompson “We need to recognize that we are working to fix issues over three decades in the making, but with a sustained, committed effort, we will see a safer, healthier Thompson.”

	 

	Last year, the Manitoba government announced more than $11 million for infrastructure and public safety initiatives in Thompson, and launched Restorative Justice North in partnership with the Manitoba Metis Federation and Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak. The goal of Restorative Justice North is to increase the use of diversion options in Thompson and resolve conflicts in a more timely way. 

	 

	Earlier this year, the province announced a $35,000 grant for the City of Thompson to work with a consultant and develop a community safety and well-being strategy. The funding builds on $300,000 previously allocated by the province to support community safety initiatives.

	 

	The province continues to support law enforcement and community stakeholders in approaches to combat and reduce public intoxication and disorder in the downtown area, and extend the Restorative Justice Centre model to the community.

	 

	Today’s announcement is one in a series of this government’s investments to meet better the needs of Manitobans struggling with mental health and addiction concerns. Since October 2019, the province has announced 17 initiatives valued at more than $28.8 million to improve mental health and addictions services throughout the province.

POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHEAST MANITOBA
					  Conditions Could Result in Temporary High Water Situations


	The Hydrologic Forecast Centre of Manitoba Infrastructure reports the potential for significant precipitation and heavy wind, starting late Saturday night and ending early Wednesday, could produce overland flooding and high water conditions.

	 

	The areas of concern are the northern regions and southeast Manitoba. These areas could receive up to 60 millimetres of precipitation. The risk is low in most other portions of the province.

	 

	For the northern areas, including the Saskatchewan River and the Churchill River watersheds, there is a higher probability of receiving 50 to 70 mm of precipitation. Base flows and soil moisture are high in these areas as some areas are already reporting very high water levels. 

	 

	For southern and southeast basins, including the Whiteshell lakes area, could receive 20 to 40 mm of precipitation. Most Whiteshell lakes are at the optimum level for this time of the year. Other southern and southeast areas could receive near 20 mm, with low risk of overland flooding. 

	 

	The Red River basin could receive up to 50 mm of precipitation. However, there is no high water concern as the Red River has capacity.

REDUCED MARKUP ON TAP FOR CRAFT LIQUOR
					  Discounted Markup for Wine, Refreshment Beverages, Cider and Mead: Wharton


	The Manitoba government is enhancing support for small liquor producers by reducing and streamlining markup rates and extending the zero-markup for public sales to include outdoor markets, Crown Services Minister Jeff Wharton announced today

	 

	“Manitoba is a strong supporter of small business, and is dedicated to listening to and working with its partners to ensure the Manitoba craft liquor industry continues to grow and thrive,” said Wharton. “Improving growth opportunities for small craft liquor producers in the Manitoba market will help create jobs, support Manitoba’s economy, and result in greater selection and savings for consumers.”

	 

	The province is adding new micro-producer discounted markups that support craft producers of wine, mead and cider and reducing markups for craft distillers, mirroring what currently exists for the local craft brewing segment of the market.

	 

	Additionally, building on exempted markups for the sale of liquor made and sold on-premises by local producers, the same exemption is now in place for producers selling at outdoor markets and other temporary locations. The combination of reducing the markup on product sold through Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries and extending the zero-markup for public sales will benefit local distillers, brewers and producers of wine, mead and cider.

	 

	Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries will be meeting with local industry stakeholders before changes to the small producer markup program take effect July 1. 

	 

	“Reduced markups for brewers have been successful in developing and promoting a vibrant craft brewing industry,” said Wharton. “Extending this to all craft liquor producers will further promote the development of the craft liquor industry in Manitoba.”

					  Labour Force Statistics Show Positive Growth during Phase One  of Manitoba's Restoring Safe Services Plan: Fielding and Eichler


	The latest economic indicators from Statistics Canada show an increase in Manitoba’s employment from April to May, a sign the province’s careful, measured approach in Phase One of its Restoring Safe Services is working, Finance Minister Scott Fielding and Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	 

	“Last month, we saw historic declines in Manitoba’s employment numbers as the COVID-19 pandemic affected the global economy,” said Fielding. “Now, as Manitoba slowly and safely reopens for business and restores services, our job market is beginning to rebound as Manitobans return to work and revive the economy.” 

	 

	The latest report from Statistics Canada indicates Manitoba fared better than the national average in key categories. Total employment in Manitoba increased by 13,100, a 2.3 per cent increase. This follows a decrease of 64,200 positions the previous month and surpasses the nationwide May increase of 1.8 per cent. Manitoba’s labour force increased by 13,800 people.

	 

	Manitoba saw a large 10.3 per cent increase in part-time jobs by 10,000, compared to the national rate of 2.8 per cent. Full-time employment was up 3,100, a 0.6 per cent increase. 

	 

	The private sector, which includes the self-employed, increased by 22,400, a 5.4 per cent gain from April to May. The national rate increased by 2.5 per cent. 

	 

	Overall, the provincial unemployment rate edged down to 11.2 per cent, the lowest across the country and below Canada’s rate of 13.7 per cent. Manitoba youth unemployment decreased 1.8 percentage points to 22.8 per cent, ranking second lowest in Canada.

	 

	“We are seeing promising growth in the private sector compared to the rest of Canada as Manitoba’s small businesses begin to rebuild and recover,” said Eichler. “Our government continues to find ways to support employers and employees so we can get more Manitobans back to work.”

	 

	The wholesale and retail trade industry saw the largest level change from April to May, while the largest changes by occupation occurred in trades, transport and equipment operators, as well as sales and service. 

	 

	Within the provincial government, the province worked with government unions, their members and non-unionized employees to modestly reduce workforce expenses and avoid public sector layoffs, Eichler noted.

	 

	The ministers noted the Manitoba government will continue to bring in policies and programs designed to help those who need support through this time. More than 5,000 Manitoba businesses have received assistance through the Manitoba Gap Protection Program, which has paid out approximately $30.5 million. The Summer Student Job Recovery Program has seen more than 1,000 employers apply for a wage subsidy for more than 2,300 student positions. The Manitoba Economic Support Centre has spoken with more than 100,000 businesses, not-for-profits, charities and other community groups. The province announced a $500-million Manitoba Restart Program to boost the economy and put even more Manitobans back to work.

	 

	The Manitoba Bureau of Statistics will release its full May 2020 Labour Force Survey bulletin this afternoon at www.gov.mb.ca/mbs/reports/203_lfs_bulletin.html.

PROVINCE INCREASING INVESTMENT TO $5.7 MILLION FOR CANADA-MANITOBA JOB GRANTS IN 2020-21
					  Program Provides Essential Training Supports to Help Employers with Post-Pandemic Recovery: Eichler


	The province is making an increased investment of $5.7 million in the Canada-Manitoba Job Grant program this year to better assist businesses with staff training costs as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	 

	“A skilled and trained workforce is always critical, and employers are telling us it is more important than ever as they face business challenges resulting from COVID-19. We have increased the budgeted amount for this program to assist with the recovery,” said Eichler. “Small and medium-sized businesses have been hit especially hard by the pandemic, and this program supports training that will help them recover, rebuild and adjust to new economic realities.”

	 

	The province’s $5.7-million investment for 2020-21 is an increase of $2 million from 2019-20. The program allows employers to apply for up to $10,000 for each of their employees, to a maximum grant of $100,000. Eligible costs include: 

	• tuition fees;

	• textbooks, software and other required materials;

	• exam fees; and

	• travel costs for the training of individuals in northern and remote communities.

	 

	Applications are now available for Canada-Manitoba Job Grants for 2020-21. The application deadline is July 3. 

	 

	“Many of Manitoba’s small businesses are adjusting their operations quickly as they look toward a post-pandemic reality,” said Jonathan Alward, Prairie region director, Canadian Federation of Independent Business. “This funding is a welcome tool to retrain staff and to help businesses adapt.”

	 

	“Manitoba’s business community has demonstrated incredible resilience amid COVID-19, an unprecedented challenge that has forced a shift away from the notion of business as usual and has required many businesses to pivot to remain operational,” said Chuck Davidson, president and CEO, Manitoba Chambers of Commerce. “Now, more than ever, our province’s employers need access to a skilled workforce, and this grant program can help them upgrade employees’ skills.”

	 

	Since mid-March, Manitoba Economic Development and Training has held stakeholder roundtables twice per week to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 35 regional and strategic partners, sector councils, industry associations, economic development agencies and chambers of commerce. 

	 

	Eichler noted that department staff are available to help companies complete grant applications, develop training plans to meet their business goals, and develop or improve their human resource plans.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT EXPANDING VISITOR ACCESS AT HOSPITALS
					  Easing of Restrictions at Hospitals, Health Centres Balances  Safety and Compassion to Meet Needs of Patients: Friesen


Backgrounder
Background Information


	Manitoba hospitals and health centres will be restoring visitor access for patients as part of Manitoba’s Phase Two reopening, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today. The gradual easing of visitor restrictions will restore the ability for patients and their loved ones to visit while measures to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 within Manitoba’s hospitals remain in place.

	 

	“Connecting with family members, loved ones and support systems are an important part of the healing process for someone in the hospital. During the peak of the pandemic, in-person visits had to be limited as we took every necessary step to prevent the spread of this virus,” said Friesen. “With the co-operation of Manitobans, our COVID-19 response has been successful and we are now pleased to be in a position to allow in-person visits to occur.” 

	 

	This expanded visitor access follows the successful introduction of outdoor visits at Manitoba’s personal care homes last week, the minister noted, adding Manitoba’s hospitals and health centres have also been tasked with finding ways to accommodate outdoor visits following the trial earlier this week at Victoria General Hospital. 

	 

	All visitors must comply with infection prevention and control measures, which includes strict hand hygiene and maintaining physical distancing (six feet/two metres apart) at all times. 

	 

	“We recognize that solitude and separation can have a significant and negative impact on a patient’s health and well-being. Our goal is to find a balance for the longer-term; a balance that will enable visits with loved ones to occur, with all necessary precautions in place,” said Friesen.

	 

	Friesen indicated the likelihood of COVID-19 being a part of the ‘new normal’ for a longer duration requires finding a longer-term balance between preventative measures and the many benefits of in-person interaction between patients and their loved ones.

	 

	Most patients will be eligible to identify a single designated support person who may visit daily. Most sites are expected to be up and running between Friday and Monday, the minister noted. Facilities will begin implementation as early as June 5, with all sites expected to welcome designated support people as visitors by the week of June 8.

MANITOBA INVESTS $33 MILLION IN DAMAGE PREVENTION AND CLIMATE RESILIENCY PROJECTS
					  Additional 10 per cent Injection Will Help Rebuild Manitoba's Economy and Support Municipalities: Premier


	The Manitoba government is investing $33 million, an additional 10 per cent top up, in damage prevention and climate resiliency projects to support municipalities across the province, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“As part of the damage prevention and climate resiliency measures we announced last November, we have identified several local priority projects that will provide greater protection to Manitobans,” said Pallister. “Investing in a flood-proof route from Winnipeg to the United States border and six shovel-ready projects are additional steps our government is taking to help rebuild Manitoba’s economy and support our municipalities through the COVID-19 pandemic.”

	 

	The province has committed to key upgrades in southern Manitoba to provide commercial traffic an alternate route when Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 is affected by high water. The province will invest $16 million to convert Provincial Road (PR) 246 from gravel to asphalt from PTH 23 near Morris to PR 205 near Aubigny, which will allow traffic to be rerouted around sections of PTH 75 that are most prone to closure.

	 

	“Creating a safe, flood-proof route as an alternative to PTH 75 means Manitoba can stay open for business in times of high water and keep goods moving from the United States,” said Pallister. “The continued flow of commercial traffic along the north-south corridor is critical to Manitoba’s economy, and by making careful, financially responsible decisions, we can ensure these goods continue to make their way to market.” 

	 

	Since 1996, PTH 75 has been closed approximately once every four years for an average of 24 days, the premier noted. The upgrades will create a flood-proof route from the United States border at Emerson to CentrePort Canada in Winnipeg.

	 

	The premier also announced today an additional $17 million investment for six projects that help build Manitoba’s climate resilience:

	• Rural Municipality (RM) of Montcalm – St. Mary’s Road improvement project; 

	• RM of Rhineland – GNS east pump house expansion;

	• St. Pierre-Jolys – berm construction;

	• RM of Wallace – Woodworth – Elkhorn lagoon and lift station upgrade;

	• RM of Wallace – Woodworth – Kenton supply wells generator backup; and

	• Altona – downtown drainage upgrade project.

	 

	“The province is funding 100 per cent of these projects to help support the long-term sustainability of our communities and it is an additional way we are helping municipal governments weather the storm from the pandemic,” Pallister said. “These projects build on previous commitments to municipalities including our recent announcement of $10 million in Building Sustainable Communities grants to support 344 projects for community development projects and nearly doubling this year’s investment in Green Team projects.”

	 

	The $33-million commitment is part of the province’s one-time capital investment in damage prevention and climate resiliency measures announced in November 2019. Stakeholder consultation continues to identify projects in the capital region and additional projects will be announced in the coming months, the premier noted.

STATEMENT FROM INDIGENOUS AND NORTHERN RELATIONS MINISTER EILEEN CLARKE ON ANNIVERSARY OF MMIWG FINAL REPORT


	As we mark the first anniversary of the release of the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, I urge all Manitobans to join the Manitoba government in remembering the lives lost in this unspeakable national tragedy.

	 

	We acknowledge and honour the women, girls, families and Indigenous communities who have shared their personal tragedies and grief and we honour their pain with a commitment to continue working together to meaningfully address the report’s calls for justice. 

	 

	We will never fully know the depth of the wounds you carry, but we stand with you today. 

	 

	We must address the systemic injustices experienced by Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people with concerted and collaborative approaches, and we are committed to taking concrete steps to respond to the recommendations from the national inquiry’s calls for justice.

	 

	We are moving forward with an engagement plan to prioritize the viewpoints and perspectives of Indigenous women, families, leaders and communities in Manitoba. In the coming weeks, I look forward to these conversations with Indigenous leadership and the Manitoba MMIWG Coalition to further this important work. 

	 

	The relationships we have already established will support our work in Manitoba as we move forward on the engagement strategy and build on the positive collaboration that has already taken place.

	  

	Work is ongoing through our Gender-Based Violence Committee of Cabinet, and we have established an interdepartmental committee that will guide further discussions on the calls for justice, which includes representation from Manitoba Status of Women and the departments of Justice, Families, Education, and Health, Seniors and Active Living. 

	 

	Complementing this work, I am pleased to note that a variety of important initiatives are underway that support the national inquiry’s calls for justice such as:

	• our ongoing work with Clan Mothers to enhance accessibility to land-based teachings for Indigenous youth who are at high risk of sexual exploitation;

	• our efforts to improve access to technology for justice stakeholders in remote and northern communities;

	• our continued efforts to work with Indigenous leadership, police agencies and other community partners to more fully incorporate the use of restorative justice options where appropriate; and

	• our ongoing partnership with Indigenous community members and elders to introduce eagle feathers for use in Manitoba court rooms.

	 

	We recognize the significance of this day, and look forward to hearing more from families, Indigenous leadership and community organizations throughout this process.

STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION DETERMINES $120-MILLION RISK RECOGNITION PROGRAM FOR MANITOBANS
					  Business Groups, Unions, Essential Services Select Program to Compensate Front-line Workers for Risks Taken during COVID-19 Pandemic: Pallister


	Based on the consensus of a stakeholder consultation group, the Manitoba government will be distributing $120 million to recognize the risks taken by front-line workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“Manitoba was the first province to commit to collaborating with the federal government on a cost-sharing program to recognize front-line workers who put their own health at risk to keep others safe and provide crucial services during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Pallister. “Our government wanted to hear from Manitobans who they thought was most in most need of this financial assistance, so we consulted the business community, trade and labour unions and essential services to shape the program and determine which positions should be eligible.”

	 

	In mid-May, the province announced the $120-million Manitoba Risk Recognition Program and formed a working group with 15 unions, business community leaders and critical service providers to submit feedback that informed five proposals and vote on the final program. Stakeholders selected a program that will provide a one-time, income-tested payment to eligible low-income front-line workers, with consideration given to the added risk due to COVID-19 and interaction with the public including clients, patients and inmates. Eligible public- and private-sector positions include the areas of health care, social services, justice, transportation and essential retail, food and beverage. 

	 

	“I want to thank these organizations, representing more than Manitoba 17,000 businesses and 110,000 workers, for providing valuable input and reaching a consensus on how best to administer risk recognition payments,” said Pallister. “Based on their feedback, we will implement a program to recognize and thank workers who played a key role in our provincial pandemic response efforts and made sacrifices in their professional and personal lives to protect all Manitobans, especially those most vulnerable.”

	 

	Eligible categories include store shelf stockers, retail salespersons, cashiers, cooks, security guards, light-duty cleaners in retail facilities, early childhood educators, licensed home-based child-care providers, family violence shelter workers, social workers, nurses and nurse practitioners, paramedics, health-care aides, community services workers (including personal care homes, home care, public health, mental health and addictions), direct service workers for adults and children with disabilities, law enforcement (including Winnipeg Police Service, Brandon Police Service and RCMP), correctional officers, long-distance truck drivers and bus drivers.

	 

	The payment is available to workers employed on a part-time or full-time basis from March 20 (the start of the provincial state of emergency) until May 29, who either worked a minimum 200 cumulative hours (or would have worked that amount but were required to self-isolate under public health orders). An employee’s total pre-tax employment income during the eligibility period must be less than $6,250 ($2,500 per month for 2.5 months) and they cannot be enrolled in the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).

	 

	The full list of eligible positions and organizations is available at https://manitoba.ca/covid19/infomanitobans/mrrp.html. Online applications will be accepted starting Wednesday, June 3. The application deadline is June 18 and the province will issue payments via direct deposit once it verifies applications.

	 

	The province will fully distribute the $120-million fund, which will be equally divided between the successful applicants. Individual amounts will be determined by the total number of participants. 

	 

	“The $120 million is substantial and will have a meaningful impact on the lives of many Manitobans,” said John Graham of the Retail Council of Canada. “The process of including public and private-sector unions and other private-sector associations in these discussions should be recognized and we appreciate the government’s sincere efforts to facilitate consensus around the eligibility criteria for the risk recognition program.”  

	 

	“Manitoba’s child-care sector has been an essential part of our province’s response to this unprecedented public health crisis, providing necessary care to the children of workers on the frontline fighting this pandemic,” said Jodie Kehl, executive director, Manitoba Child Care Association. “We appreciate the province recognizing that our early childhood educators, child-care assistants and home-based providers have been exposed to greater risk during this time and providing them with this important payment.”

	 

	The province thanks the following groups for participating in the consultation and confidential voting process:

	• Abilities Manitoba,

	• Business Council of Manitoba,

	• Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers,

	• Canadian Federation of Independent Business,

	• Christian Labour Association of Canada,

	• Canadian Union of Public Employees,

	• Manitoba Association of Health Care Professionals,

	The Manitoba government is investing $3.5 million in the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre to enhance access to mental health and addiction treatment in Manitoba, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	 

	“The Bruce Oake Recovery Centre is a brilliant idea and we are pleased to partner with the Oake family whose vision and drive has been unequaled in their commitment to help others struggling with addiction.” said Friesen. “We look forward to the completion of the facility next spring, knowing the many benefits the recovery centre will provide to Manitoba families.”

	 

	The $3.5-million contribution will be used to support capital construction costs for the centre. The Bruce Oake Recovery Centre will add 50 residential addiction treatment beds into the addiction system in Manitoba. The facility is scheduled to open its doors in the spring of 2021, the minister noted.

	 

	“We are thankful the government of Manitoba shares our vision of the importance of treatment for those suffering from addiction. This commitment helps ensure we will be able to offer recovery to those with little or no financial means,” said Scott, Anne and Darcy Oake for the Bruce Oake Memorial Foundation.  “Our first-born son, Bruce, lost his battle with addiction at age 25 and we began this project as a way to remember him, while at the same time hoping other families could be spared such a tragic outcome. Our family, our board of directors are truly grateful for its support and confidence.”

	 

	Today’s announcement is one in a series of this government’s investments to meet better the needs of Manitobans struggling with mental health and addiction concerns.

	 

	The minister noted the additional beds at the centre adds important capacity to alleviate pressures on existing residential treatment services and allows partnership organizations the opportunity to focus on other critical levels of service.

	 

	The investment supports recommendations in the VIRGO report to increase capacity for residential substance use and addiction treatment including lengthening treatment programs, improving accessibility and ensuring services are co-ordinated across programs, practitioners, organizations and levels of care over time.

	 

	“Since last fall, we have invested more than $25 million to improve access to mental health and addictions treatment and care,” said Friesen. “Today’s announcement supports those investments and will help us ensure we’re able to provide the right care in the right place at the right time for Manitobans.”

PROVINCE RELEASES MADE-IN-MANITOBA BEST PRACTICES FOR BOREAL WETLANDS


	The Manitoba government has released the Boreal Wetlands Conservation Codes of Practice, a series of best management practices co-developed with industry and stakeholders, that provide guidance on how to avoid, minimize, and offset for impacts to boreal wetlands that result from resource and access roads and crossings, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today. 

	 

	“The Boreal Wetlands Conservation Codes of Practice fulfils a commitment in the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan,” said Pedersen. “By adopting this approach, Manitoba is reducing red tape for industry, supporting sustainable development of our natural resources and supporting the conservation of Manitoba’s boreal wetlands.”

	 

	Manitoba’s boreal region contains 22 million hectares of wetlands, which provide habitat for many wildlife species, help clean and filter water, mitigate the impacts of flooding and drought, and store vast amounts of carbon. Development that affects the highly connected flow of water through these wetlands can have both upstream and downstream effects on biodiversity, habitat, and carbon sequestration capacity. However, these impacts can be managed, controlled and offset through best practices.

	 

	These codes of practice provide certainty for resource developers by providing guidance about where and how to operate within and around boreal wetlands on Crown lands, said Pedersen.

	 

	“Boreal wetlands are some of the most carbon-rich ecosystems in the world, which also provide critical habitat for a variety of wildlife and species at risk,” said Karla Guyn, chief executive officer, Ducks Unlimited Canada. “The Boreal Wetlands Conservation Codes of Practice is an important step in safeguarding these natural areas, and Ducks Unlimited Canada is pleased to have been part of the committee that contributed to their development.”

	 

	Developed through a committee of government, industry, environmental non-governmental organizations, and with the guidance of an Indigenous advisor, the Boreal Wetlands Conservation Codes of Practice contribute to the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan, and will help conserve, responsibly manage and protect these valuable wetland ecosystems.

STATEMENT FROM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING MINISTER RALPH EICHLER ON STUDENT JOBS MB


	I am pleased to share that the launch of Student Jobs MB, announced yesterday by Premier Brian Pallister, has been a resounding success. The Province of Manitoba has had a great response from both students and employers, and there is room for a lot more. Since the launch, more than 2,300 students have created profiles and submitted over 2,100 job applications. 

	 

	As well, more than 100 employers have posted 230 available jobs for students. The Department of Economic Development and Training has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from employers and students on how user-friendly and secure the site is. This tool will support Manitobans as we move toward Phase Two of the government’s Restoring Safe Services strategy on Monday.  

	 

	Student Jobs MB is a complement to the successful Student Summer Jobs Recovery Program. More than 830 employers have applied to the Student Summer Jobs Recovery Program, making 1,929 positions available since it was launched on April 24 as part of the Manitoba government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Employers have told the government that because of this wage subsidy program, they are able to hire more students and meet some of the increasing demands for their services. This is good news for students, employers and all Manitobans.  

	 

	I am confident the continued success of these two programs will help Manitoba rebuild its workforce and economy during these challenging times.

PROVINCE CONTINUES MEASURES FOR MANITOBANS IMPACTED BY COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  Deferred Tax Filing Deadlines, Postponed Eviction Hearings and Rent Freeze  Support Manitoba Businesses, Tenants: Fielding


	The Manitoba government is once again extending measures aimed to help residents and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	 

	“Manitoba’s small- and medium-sized businesses continue to face a challenging economic situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and we want to help them further by giving them more time to submit provincial taxes,” said Fielding. “As we enter Phase Two of restoring services across Manitoba and more businesses reopen, we want to provide them with some additional financial flexibility.” 

	 

	After extending the April and May filing deadlines for small and medium-sized businesses with monthly remittances of no more than $10,000, the province is now extending the deadlines for June as well. Businesses will now have up to three additional months to remit retail sales taxes and the Health and Post Secondary Education Tax Levy, commonly called the payroll tax. 

	 

	Fielding noted in the last two months, deferred retail sales and payroll tax deferrals resulted in an estimated $10.8 million savings to Manitoba businesses. 

	 

	The province is continuing to postpone non-urgent eviction hearings and suspending any rent increases scheduled to take effect in June. The Residential Tenancies Branch (RTB) and Residential Tenancies Commission (RTC) will continue to postpone all hearings for non-urgent matters to halt evictions, and all scheduled hearings are delayed to protect Manitobans from evictions during the pandemic, with certain exceptions to deal with urgent issues that involve the health and safety of tenants. Eviction orders will only be issued to address issues affecting health and safety including unlawful activities.

	 

	“We continue to balance safety concerns with support for renters facing economic hardship or needing to self isolate due to COVID-19,” said Fielding. “The Residential Tenancies Branch remains available to resolve urgent situations involving health and safety for landlords and tenants.”

	 

	Fielding noted the RTB also recognizes landlords are experiencing financial challenges as some tenants are unable to pay full rent. After June 30, the branch plans to schedule hearings to adjudicate landlord applications for orders of possession on a priority basis. Hearings will be scheduled based on the order in which the applications are received. Landlords and tenants are encouraged to contact the RTB for information by telephone at 204-945-2476 or (toll-free) at 1-800-782-8403 and by email at rtb@gov.mb.ca.

Background Information


	The Manitoba government is providing $300,000 to provide education programs offered by the Alzheimer Society of Manitoba for individuals living with dementia and their families, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	 

	“Dementia has a tremendous impact on families, the health-care system and our economy. Today, more than 23,000 Manitobans are living with Alzheimer’s disease or another dementia, and this the number is expected to double in the next generation,” said Friesen. “This funding will support the Alzheimer Society of Manitoba as it continue its work to make a difference in the lives of people living with dementia by providing education to families across the province.”

	 

	The minister said the funding will be used to expand the family education and first-link client support services programs that cover the full disease range from the beginning to the end of illness, with topics such as the progression of dementia, communication skills and preventing and responding to changing behaviours.

	 

	“This much-needed funding helps support a comprehensive education series to support Manitobans living with dementia along the continuum of the disease,” said Wendy Schettler, CEO, Alzheimer Society of Manitoba. “Families count on this information so that they are better equipped to face the daily challenges of dementia with reliable information, resources, and an understanding of what’s to come.”

	 

	The minister noted that caregivers of older adults with dementia provide an average of 26 hours of care each week, which is substantially higher than the 17 hours provided by caregivers of those without dementia.

	 

	“These family education programs are key to helping caregivers better understand the disease and how it affects their loved one,” said Friesen. “These programs also gives them valuable information on caregiving, community and health-system resources and supports, legal information and self-care.”

	 

	While some in-person seminars have been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the society has been offering online sessions. For more information, visit https://alzheimer.mb.ca.

PROVINCE UNVEILS OVER $7 MILLION IN NEW CONSERVATION TRUST PROJECTS
					  Building a Legacy of Work to Benefit all Manitobans: Pedersen


	The first round of Conservation Trust projects for 2020 have been awarded to 19 different conservation organizations, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today. More than $1.8 million in Conservation Trust funds will contribute to 23 Manitoba projects throughout the province, with matching funds of nearly $5.4 million, the total investment in these project is more than $7 million. 

	 

	“The projects announced today provide support to Manitoba-based conservation work that conserves and enhances Manitoba’s natural infrastructure,” said Pedersen. “The conservation work being done throughout the province is building a legacy of work that will benefit all Manitobans and ensure Manitoba remains Canada’s cleanest, greenest, most climate-resilient province.”

	 

	The Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan called for the establishment of a trust to provide long-term and stable support to conservation efforts throughout the province. The Conservation Trust was established in 2018 with a $102 million contribution to The Winnipeg Foundation that established an endowment fund to generate annual revenues for conservation projects in perpetuity. Two additional Trusts, the GROW Trust and the Wetlands GROW Trust, have also been created, bringing Manitoba’s total investment in these trusts to $204 million.

	 

	Activities funded by the Conservation Trust include conserving biodiversity, mitigating floods and droughts, supporting climate-change mitigation through carbon sequestration, improving soil health, preserving waterways and decreasing soil erosion. 

	 

	“Investing in projects that preserve our environment cannot wait as they play a vital role in combating climate change,” Pedersen noted. “Due to the innovative approach and the permanent endowment we have created, the Conservation Trust’s revenues ensure we are able to invest in worthy projects year after year, no matter the financial pressures Manitoba faces.”

	 

	The first round of Conservation Trust Funding for 2020 include:

	• Inter-Mountain Watershed District’s Streambank Stabilization Project on Turtle River ($147,500) – The community-based watershed district is working to reduce soil erosion and restore riparian habitats along the Turtle River as outlined in the Dauphin Lake Integrated Watershed Management Plan.

	• Fort Whyte Alive’s Open Spaces Enhancement Project ($40,000) – Fort Whyte Alive provides opportunities for Manitobans to connect with nature and understand the importance of the environment to everyone’s well-being. This investment will be used by Fort Whyte to help Manitobans connect to the natural world through the enhancement of the open spaces surrounding its Interpretive Centre.

	• Opasquia Trails Incorporated’s Grace Lake Boardwalk and Boreal Forest Trail ($50,000) – East of The Pas, the project at Grace Lake will see a boardwalk added to a land-based trail through an old growth boreal forest. The project will connect visitors with the natural environment in order to enhance education, life skills, culture, arts, recreation and tourism to this area of northern Manitoba.

	• Delta Waterfowl’s Conservation and Enhancement of Wetlands in Manitoba Project ($75,000) – Delta Waterfowl is working to conserve biodiversity through enhancing waterfowl breeding habitats and nesting structures throughout Manitoba.

	• Association of Manitoba Community Pastures’ Grassland Study and Biodiversity Enhancement Project ($250,000) – This Manitoba-based group is working with producers to address the dangers posed to Manitoba grasslands, while preserving the integrity of community pastures that support a variety of habitats. The project will engage wildlife biologists to work towards native prairie and rangeland enhancement.

	• Three projects of Manitoba Forage and Grassland Association ($231,333 total) – This farmer-led group will help farmers to adopt practices that restore wildlife habitat and enhance carbon sequestration, soil health and water management.

	 

	The Conservation Trust is permanently endowed to support and inspire conservation projects for generations, Pedersen said, adding the fund is expected to generate on average $5 million a year, which will be invested into conservation efforts throughout Manitoba every year. It is managed by The Winnipeg Foundation, with projects approved, tracked and evaluated by the Manitoba Habitat Heritage Corporation.

	 

	“We are pleased to be part of a permanent funding initiative that will support long-term support for conservation and adaptation to climate change in rural Manitoba,” said Tim Sopuck, chief executive officer, Manitoba Habitat Heritage Corporation. “This approach has been very well received by the conservation community in Manitoba and beyond.”

	 

	A second round of Conservation Trust and GROW Trust grants focused on watershed projects will be announced in the coming months.

PROVINCE LAUNCHES ONLINE TOOL TO HELP MATCH EMPLOYERS AND STUDENTS FOR JOBS


	The Manitoba government has launched Student Jobs MB, a new and exciting online tool dedicated to matching students looking for job opportunities to employers with workforce needs throughout the province, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“Summer jobs are important for youth in not only helping pay for an education, but for building life skills and developing future career interests,” said Pallister. “Employers also benefit from hiring students, who can bring energy and new perspectives to their operations and assist them greatly in rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic. This new tool will help bring them together.”

	 

	Student Jobs MB is simple and free to use, allowing students to be matched with and to apply for multiple jobs with the click of a button. The technology is safe and secure, and designed to protect user privacy. Private-sector employers, not-for-profit organizations and governments are able to post jobs and connect directly with students. This tool expedites the hiring process and will encourage student summer employment.

	 

	Student Jobs MB will be the primary source used by the province to connect students with government employment opportunities offered through the Student Temporary Employment Program, the Conservation Green Team and Urban/Hometown Green Team partners.

	 

	This new tool will complement the Summer Student Recovery Jobs Program, which was launched on April 24 as a key response to the economic impact of the pandemic. The Summer Student Recovery Jobs Program supports employers in hiring high school and post-secondary students by making $120 million available for an hourly $7 wage subsidy, up to a maximum of $5,000 per student. The program is open to students aged 15 to 29, with an employment period from May 1 to Sept. 4. Employers can be subsidized to hire up to five students. To date, 793 employers offering 1,841 student jobs have responded to the program.

	 

	“As Manitoba restores services safely during the COVID-19 pandemic, students can be an important resource to help employers reopen,” said Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler. “This easy-to-use online tool will allow students to find jobs in their communities and will help employers connect with quality applicants.”

SECOND PHASE OF RESTORING SAFE SERVICES PLAN TO BEGIN JUNE 1
					  Feedback from Manitobans Helped Inform Final Phase Two Plan: Pallister


	Based on feedback from Manitobans and current public health data, the Manitoba government has finalized the draft Phase Two plan and will implement measures effective June 1 to continue safely restoring services and opening additional businesses while ensuring physical distancing, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“I want to thank Manitobans for their input, and as a result of these discussions and advice from public health experts, we are in a position to move forward with phase two of our plan to safely restore our services,” said Pallister. “I also want to thank Manitobans for continuing to respect physical distancing guidelines and ask everyone to keep taking steps to protect themselves and others as we continue to ease restrictions.”

	 

	As of June 1, limited access to educational facilities, where physical distancing can be maintained, will be allowed for additional tutorial days, such as one-on-one learning, assessment and specific programming. Manitoba Education will continue planning and consulting with school divisions and other education stakeholders, the premier noted.

	 

	The plan for Phase Two was revised from the original draft document, released May 21, based on input from the public and businesses, as well as additional input from public health officials. Changes include:

	• detailed guidance for post-secondary educational institutions and vocational colleges;

	• removing occupancy limits for therapeutic and health-care services; 

	• detailed guidance for senior’s clubs;

	• additional details on requirements for the safe operation of splash pads;

	• updated guidance for community centres;

	• the reopening of arts and cultural activities, such as dance, art and theatre;

	• clarifications on the opening of bars, beverage rooms, brew pubs, micro-brewers and distilleries to allow sites that do not serve food to open, as well as updated guidance from public health that all patrons must be seated at tables and stand-up service is not allowed; and

	• detailed public health guidelines for film productions.

	 

	A number of measures initially outlined in the draft plan for Phase Two can resume effective June 1 including: 

	• increasing child-care centre occupancy to up to 24 children plus staffing;

	• increasing day camp group sizes to 24;

	• resuming sports, arts and cultural activities for children and adults;

	• lifting occupancy limits at outdoor recreation facilities and golf courses outdoors, as long as physical distancing can be maintained and allowing limited access to indoor spaces;

	• allowing direct travel to northern parks, campgrounds, cabins, lodges and resorts while ensuring physical distancing;

	• allowing public/private swimming pools, spas, fitness clubs, gyms and community/service centres to reopen with some limitations;

	• allowing religious or other organizations to hold outdoor services or events without limitation on numbers if people stay in their vehicles;

	• reopening manicurists and pedicurists, tattoo parlours, estheticians, cosmetologists, electrologists and tanning parlours at 50 per cent capacity;

	• allowing restaurants to reopen indoor spaces at 50 per cent capacity and continue to offer patio services at that capacity level; and

	• allowing bars, beverage rooms, micro-brewers and similar businesses to operate patio service at 50 per cent of site capacity and to reopen indoor spaces at 50 per cent capacity.

	 

	No changes will be made to the requirements for reopening museums, galleries and libraries, and parks, campgrounds yurts and vacation cabins.

	 

	Detailed information on the plan for Phase Two of service restoration and steps people can take to reduce their risk and workplace guidance for businesses can be found at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices.

	 

	Other changes that came into effect on May 22 included increasing gathering sizes to 25 people indoors and 50 people outdoors, and allowing professional sports teams to resume practicing.

	 

	“Case numbers and positive test rates continue to be low and other key factors are also positive,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “These additional steps to safely restore services will help ease the impacts on Manitobans and ensure the health system continues to be able to respond if case numbers increase slightly.”

	 

	Mass gatherings such as concerts, festivals and major sporting events will not be considered before September 2020, Roussin noted. He also noted that it is key for people to stay home if they are sick to further reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

	 

	Roussin continued to encourage businesses to take steps to help staff, patrons and visitors stay safe including:

	• ensuring people are able to reasonably maintain two metres of distance;

	• only conducting necessary and brief exchanges within two metres of others;

	• applying enhanced cleaning protocols, especially in common areas like washrooms;

	• maintaining physical distancing and food-handling protocols in workplace areas including lunch and common areas;

	• staying home when feeling sick; and

	• following personal risk reduction measures.

PROVINCE THANKS MANITOBANS FOR VALUABLE INPUT ON PLANS TO RESTORE SAFE SERVICES
					  Feedback Has Helped Shape Plan to Reopen Manitoba for Business: Pallister


	The Manitoba government is thanking Manitobans for providing input on the draft plan of Restoring Safe Services Phase Two, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“Last week, we shared with you a draft plan to guide Manitobans into the second phase of safely restoring our services and rebuilding our economy from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Pallister. “We’re able to move forward and relax restrictions because of the efforts of Manitobans to flatten the curve, and our path forward will be shaped by all the valuable feedback we received from residents, workers and businesses.” 

	 

	After the premier announced the draft plan May 21, the province received more than 5,200 questions and survey feedback forms. Since March 30, Manitobans have submitted more than 8,300 questions or survey forms on the pandemic response. Pallister noted the input received will continue to help public health officials refine plans going forward.

	 

	From the May 21 survey, 77 per cent of respondents said they definitely or somewhat agree that Phase One of Manitoba’s roadmap was an appropriate, well-considered first step in restoring services safely in the province. Respondents cited the routine briefings by Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, and other officials as the most helpful source of information.  

	 

	“Our plan to gradually open additional businesses is being made in careful consultation with our public health experts and taking into account the experiences and concerns of Manitobans,” said Pallister. “We rely on all Manitobans, from front-line workers to the business community to those receiving our services, to let us know their thoughts on how best to safely expand available services, while maintaining physical distancing measures and other considerations of our health and well-being.”

	 

	Along with the opportunity to provide online feedback through http://EngageMB.ca, the province hosted three public telephone town halls, which had nearly 52,000 participants from across the province. 

	 

	Roussin and Manitoba’s cabinet ministers have participated in several stakeholder meetings with hundreds of attendees who represent those in the education, child-care and business sectors, as well as virtual town halls with the Winnipeg and Manitoba chambers of commerce.

MANITOBA PURCHASES THE KING'S SCHOOL TO ENHANCE FRENCH-LANGUAGE EDUCATION
					  Innovative and Cost-Effective Solution will Address Increased Demand: Goertzen


	The province has purchased The King’s School to increase capacity for French-language education in northeast Winnipeg in an innovative approach to completing the Manitoba government’s 20 New Schools Guarantee, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	 

	The King’s School was owned by Gateway Christian Community Inc. before the purchase. The facility will be expanded and renovated over time to become a school for Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine (DSFM), which will use it for approximately 350 students from kindergarten to Grade 8. 

	 

	“This represents a true win-win opportunity, and is a credit to the officials at Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine and Gateway Christian Community Inc. who have been creative in putting the needs of their students first,” said Goertzen. “With its planned improvements, the school building will fill a high demand for French-language education in northeast Winnipeg.”

	 

	The purchase of The King’s School and its upcoming expansion and renovations for DSFM will cost the province approximately $13.5 million, which is about $8.7 million less than it would cost to construct a new school, Goertzen noted.

	 

	During the transition period, the province and DSFM have agreed to allow existing classes to continue at The King’s School until construction of a new facility for Gateway Christian Community Inc. in West St. Paul is complete. At the same time, DSFM will establish school programming in northeast Winnipeg. 

	 

	“The school in northeast Winnipeg marks an important step forward in creating new learning spaces for our francophone communities,” said Bernard Lesage, president, Commission Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine. “The newly acquired school will allow us to better welcome our current and future students so we can continue to provide them with a quality French-language education in their neighbourhood.” 

	 

	The temporary joint use of The King’s School will require minor renovations to the facility during the summer of 2020 and an installation of four temporary modular classrooms for use by its students until June 30, 2022, when DSFM will fully take over the space.

	 

	“We are excited to partner with the French school division to see this property continue to serve the needs of the community,” said Peter Todd, pastoral team leader, Panet Road congregation of Gateway Church.

	 

	“This is a great arrangement that will see Gateway Christian Community Inc. and The King’s School continue to offer educational, community and faith-based programming at the site for the duration of the shared-use agreement,” said Goertzen. “DSFM will recruit students to its newly acquired school, initially focusing on kindergarten and Grade 1 this fall.”

	 

	The province is working toward the construction of 20 new schools within the next 10 years across Manitoba. This commitment comes with a heightened investment in school construction and will give more students from kindergarten to Grade 12 the opportunity to learn at the best possible facilities, the minister noted.

STATEMENT FROM HEALTH, SENIORS AND ACTIVE LIVING MINISTER CAMERON FRIESEN ON PARAMEDIC SERVICES WEEK


	May 24 to 30 marks Paramedic Services Week 2020 in Manitoba. This year’s theme, Pandemic: Paramedics on the Front Line, highlights the crucial roles these highly skilled front-line health-care providers play in an integrated health system. 

	 

	On land and in the air, paramedics provide fast and often life-saving care to patients and clients at home, in the community and during transport to health-care facilities, ensuring people get the care they need, when and where they need it. 

	 

	Working to their full scope of practice, paramedics are a critical part of our health-care system, providing patient care from the moment a call for help is made and offering specialized treatments well before arrival at a hospital or emergency department.  

	 

	Since 2016, Manitoba has increased EMS funding by $12.1 million to allow for the creation of about 150 new full-time equivalent paramedic positions. 

	 

	In 2019, the government invested $10 million to purchase 65 replacement ambulances that modernize the province’s fleet, ensure paramedic safety and improve patient comfort.

	 

	In addition, the province continues to move towards self-regulation for the profession of paramedicine. Public consultations are currently being held on the practice of paramedicine regulation. 

	 

	The valued contributions our paramedics make every day is appreciated, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when they are often the first point of contact for Manitobans in need. 

	 

	I want to thank Manitoba’s paramedics for being true health-care heroes as they put their own health and safety on the line to care for others across the province. Your dedication, commitment and hard work are very valued – by myself and by all Manitobans.

	Yukon has already implemented a paid sick leave program for employers. A national paid sick leave program would ensure people can stay home from work when they are sick without fear of not being able to pay their bills. It will also give the public confidence that the businesses and workplaces they visit are safe.

MANITOBA INVESTS $4.6 MILLION TO SUPPORT LOW-INCOME MANITOBANS WITH DISABILITIES
					  Province Unveils New Program as Part of Comprehensive Pandemic Response: Pallister


	The province is extending $4.6 million in direct and immediate financial support to low-income Manitobans with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic through the new Disability Economic Support Program, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“COVID-19 is creating new challenges and causing financial difficulties for some of our province’s most vulnerable people,” said Pallister. “Manitobans living with disabilities may be facing additional costs to adjust to the new realities of daily life during the pandemic. As we respond to these challenges together, our government is making an important investment to help address urgent needs.”   

	 

	More than 23,000 Manitobans receive monthly benefits under the disability category of Employment and Income Assistance. Under the Disability Economic Support Program, each of these Manitobans will be mailed a $200 cheque in early June for one-time support. This payment will not be considered taxable income and will not affect any other benefits received.

	 

	“The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in hardship for many Manitobans with disabilities and this payment will provide economic relief to thousands of people,” said Janet Forbes, executive director, Inclusion Winnipeg Inc. “We appreciate the province recognizing the financial challenges faced by people with disabilities and providing additional support during this difficult time.”

	 

	The Disability Economic Support Program is part of the expanded Manitoba Protection Plan, a co-ordinated government response to challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The premier noted this response includes the recently announced Seniors Economic Recovery Credit as well as plans to provide additional support to Manitoba’s essential workers.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES MAJOR REHABILITATION OF PTH 32
					  Full Reconstruction and Twinning in Winkler will Improve Traffic Flow: Schuler


	The Manitoba government is undertaking a major reconstruction and twinning project on Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 32 in Winkler, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today. 

	 

	“The major reconstruction and twinning of PTH 32 will greatly improve traffic flow in the Winkler area,” said Schuler. “We are pleased to be moving forward as soon as possible with the improvements to First Street in Winkler from Victoria Street to PTH 14.”

	 

	The project includes installation of a pathway on the east side of PTH 32 and new traffic signals at Mountain Avenue. It also includes upgraded signals at the intersections of Roblin Boulevard and Cargill Road, and upgraded CP Rail crossing surface and signals.

	 

	“This is one of the busiest roadways in rural Manitoba with traffic counts measuring up to 15,000 cars per day,” said Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen. “The city of Winkler is growing rapidly with a thriving industrial, commercial and retail community that continues to expand. This investment will continue to support growth in Winkler.”

	 

	“The City of Winkler Council and our entire region are delighted our vision is about to come to fruition, and this government has seen the need to improve the safety and capacity of PTH 32,” said Mayor Martin Harder, City of Winkler. “This project has been on our radar for over 15 years and good things are worth the wait.” 

	 

	Construction is expected to begin next week with expected substantial completion by late fall of 2020, Schuler noted, adding sidewalk work may carry over into early summer 2021. Construction updates will be posted online at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/.

PROVINCE OPENING CANNABIS MARKET TO MORE RETAILERS


	The Manitoba government is moving forward on its plan for an open and competitive cannabis retail market, Crown Services Minister Jeff Wharton announced today.

	“We are pleased to open the market further by allowing more retailers to apply for retail licences,” said Wharton. “This move will enable local entrepreneurs to create jobs and support Manitoba’s economy, which is a critical step as we work toward rebuilding Manitoba in the wake of COVID-19.”  

	Beginning June 1, the province is opening the cannabis retail application process to all prospective retailers. This includes the introduction of a new controlled-access licence for retailers. Manitoba will also continue to offer age-restricted licences for retailers wishing to open stand-alone stores.  

	To become a retailer, applicants will be required to successfully complete the required application process, enter into a Cannabis Store Retailer Agreement with Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries, and be issued an applicable licence from the Liquor, Gaming and Cannabis Authority of Manitoba.

	The minister noted that one location per applicant will be processed at a time and new entrants to the Manitoba market will be prioritized. 

	There are currently 30 stores with age-restricted licences in Manitoba. Retailers in this next phase will be limited to owning no more than 15 per cent of stand-alone stores in Manitoba. This will be expanded as more stores enter the market.

	“COVID-19 has presented challenges for all Manitobans, including local businesses,” said Wharton. “In launching this third phase of our retail strategy, we are keeping our promise to build a competitive cannabis retail environment and supporting Manitoba’s economic recovery.”

	For more information or to apply, prospective retailers are encouraged to visit:

	The data also shows:
	•    one individual is currently hospitalized, with no individuals in intensive care;
	•    18 active cases and 267 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at seven.

	As of yesterday, an additional 873 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 37,272.

	Effective today, public health orders have been modified to increase the limit on gathering size to no more than 25 people for indoor premises and 50 for outdoor areas, providing social distancing measures are in place. In addition, players, coaches, managers, training staff and medical personnel employed by or affiliated with a professional sports team may attend the team's facilities for the purposes of training and practicing, provided that no members of the public are permitted to enter those facilities.

	Understanding the patterns and trends of COVID-19 transmission is an important component of Manitoba’s reopening strategy and will inform the gradual lifting of public health restrictions and other elements of the province’s COVID-19 response. Manitoba has developed several options for sentinel testing including introducing voluntary asymptomatic testing for clients in a number of health-care settings to further monitor the presence of COVID-19 in the province.

	Manitobans who present for non-COVID-19 related care may be offered the testing as part of sentinel surveillance. Testing for COVID-19 is still not recommended for Manitobans who do not have symptoms associated with the virus. People without symptoms should not seek out testing at this time.

MANITOBA SUPPORTING RECOVERY OF LODGES AND OUTFITTERS


	The Manitoba government is taking steps to help the lodge and outfitter sector recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“The COVID pandemic and the closure of the Canada–United States border to tourist travel has had a significant effect on the outdoor tourism sector this spring,” said Pedersen. “By taking common-sense steps to ease requirements for our lodge and outfitting operators, and by starting on the road to enhanced and more efficient licensing services for hunting guides, we are working together to position our lodges and outfitters for recovery.”

	Manitoba is waiving big-game utilization requirements for 2020, ensuring that future allocations will not be affected by the loss of the spring season due to the pandemic, and provide additional black bear hunting opportunities to outfitters in areas with chronic black bear-related agricultural damage.

	Hunting guides play a critical role in the delivery of outfitted guiding experiences. The Guide License Program provides those seeking an outfitter a degree of assurance the hired guide has a specific set of knowledge and skills. The transfer of the Guide License Program to the Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association will expedite licence issuance to hunting guides while reducing government red tape.

	Once transitioned, the Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association will review and assess licence applications, administer examinations for guides and issue hunting guide licences on behalf of the minister of agriculture and resource development. Further information on the transfer will be available at a later date, and hunting guides should continue to apply for renewed and new licences through the existing process.

	“The Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association is thrilled to take on the administration of the hunting guide license program,” said Brian Kotak, executive director of the Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association. “In continued collaboration with Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development, we look forward to enhancing the license program to deliver quality training for our existing and new guides, creating more professional guides who offer world-class service and hunting experiences in Manitoba.”

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES ONLINE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT FOR ROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS NEAR OAKBANK
					  Asking for Input on Intersection of  Provincial Roads 206 and 213: Schuler


	The province is launching an online public engagement to seek input on how to improve safety at the intersection of Provincial Road (PR) 206 and PR 213 (Garven Road), Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	 

	“Road safety is a priority of the Manitoba government, and we are listening to concerns expressed by drivers and community members about the intersection of PR 206 and Garven Road,” said Schuler. “In response to serious collisions at the intersection, Manitoba Infrastructure added interim safety measures last year, with the intention of creating permanent solutions. We are now gathering public input on the proposed plan.” 

	 

	In June 2019, Schuler announced interim improvements for the intersection north of Oakbank including the installation of rumble strips on Garven Road east and west of the intersection, flags on the stop-ahead signs and a flashing red light on the stop signs. In November, the province reduced the speed limit on Garven Road to 70 km/h for 300 metres on either side of the intersection and reduced the speed limit on PR 206 between Oakbank and Garven Road to 90 km/h from 100 km/h. 

	 

	The province is now seeking public input on two options for permanent safety infrastructure at the intersection: a roundabout or traffic control signals. 

	 

	Due to restrictions on gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the province is holding a virtual public engagement through the EngageMB portal. To take part in the consultation, visit https://engagemb.ca/garven-road starting Monday, May 25. 

	 

	The online public engagement will close Friday, June 5.

					  Provincial Investments and Preparedness Helped Alleviate High-Water Concerns this Spring: Schuler


	The province has ended the spring 2020 operation of the Red River Floodway as water levels along the Red River continue to recede to normal levels, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“Manitoba Infrastructure was prepared and had plans in place to deal with high-water activity this spring,” said Schuler. “Our government has made major investments into flood mitigation measures over the past four years, and we will continue to work with municipalities to enhance high-water protection in the future.”

	On April 8, the province advised the Red River Floodway would be activated to manage water levels within the city of Winnipeg. The floodway operated for a total of 28 days this spring. The gates have now been lowered to their storage position.

	Five communities in southern Manitoba either were affected by dike closures or ramped closures because of high-water activity this spring. All communities were able to maintain continued access. Dike closures occurred at the following locations:
	•    Noyse and West Lynne dikes in Emerson;
	•    east side of Letellier at Provincial Road (PR) 201; and
	•    east side of St. Jean Baptiste.

	Ramped dike closures occurred at the following locations:
	•    Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 on the north side of Morris; and
	•    PR 200 on the north side of St. Adolphe.

	Manitoba Infrastructure also reports the Red River water level in Winnipeg was at 8.7 feet at James Avenue as of May 21 and will continue to drop. The Red River is currently within its banks at all locations from Emerson to Lake Winnipeg.

PROVINCE UNVEILS PRELIMINARY DRAFT SECOND PHASE OF RESTORING SAFE SERVICES PLAN
					  Further Reopening will be Based on Keeping Manitoba's COVID-19 Curve Flat: Pallister


	The Manitoba government is examining additional steps to gradually continue to safely restore services and open additional businesses while ensuring physical distancing measures remain in place, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Today we are sharing a draft plan that will help inform and guide us in the second phase of safely restoring our services,” said Pallister. “We thank Manitobans for their diligence in respecting physical distancing guidelines, and we hope to be in a position to move forward and ease some additional restrictions while ensuring the health and well-being of all Manitobans.”

	In careful consultation with Public Health experts, as part of Phase Two, the province is currently examining limited access to educational facilities, where physical distancing can be maintained, to allow for additional tutorial days, such as one-on-one learning, assessment and specific programming.

	To ensure students are equipped to transition to the new school year, additional teaching days are being examined for the upcoming school year, including starting schools on Aug. 31, and repurposing some of the non-instructional days throughout the school year, the premier noted.

	“Our young Manitobans are our most precious asset, and we need to do everything we can to support students and help prepare them for a bright future,” said Pallister. “We know this has been a challenging time for students and their families as they juggle remote learning while missing their classmates and friends. We want to examine additional ways to assist them in meeting their educational needs.”

	The Department of Education will continue planning and consulting with school divisions and other education stakeholders, the premier noted.

	The draft plan for restoring services in Phase Two builds on measures Restoring Safe Services:  Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap for Recovery, which set out an evidence-based plan to ease public health measures that had escalated since mid-January.

	Others being examined for the second phase of service restoration include:
	•    increasing child-care centre occupancy to up to 24 children plus staffing;
	•    increasing day camp group sizes to 24;
	•    resuming sports activities for children and adults;
	•    lifting occupancy limits at outdoor recreation facilities and golf courses outdoors, as long as physical distancing can be maintained and allowing limited access to indoor spaces;
	•    allowing direct travel to northern parks, campgrounds, cabins, lodges and resorts while ensuring physical distancing;
	•    allowing public/private swimming pools, spas, fitness clubs, gyms and community/service centres to reopen with some limitations;
	•    allowing religious or other organizations to hold outdoor services without limitation on numbers if people stay in their vehicles;
	•    reopening manicurists and pedicurists, tattoo parlours, estheticians, cosmetologists, electrologists and tanning parlours at 50 per cent capacity;
	•    allowing restaurants to reopen indoor spaces at 50 per cent capacity and continue to offer patio services at that capacity level;
	•    allowing bars, beverage rooms, micro-brewers and similar businesses that serve food and drinks to operate patio service at 50 per cent of site capacity and to reopen indoor spaces at 50 per cent capacity; and
	•    allowing the resumption of film productions while ensuring physical distancing.

	Other changes include the increasing gathering sizes to 25 people indoors and 50 people outdoors, and allowing residents of personal care homes and long-term care facilities to have visits outdoors. These changes will come into effect on May 22.

	No changes were made to the requirements for reopening hair stylists/barbers, museums, galleries and libraries and parks, campgrounds yurts and vacation cabins.

	“We look at a number of key factors when making these recommendations including how the spread of the virus has been controlled, the stability of the health system’s capacity, public health capacity and the number of outbreaks in vulnerable settings,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. “We will only take additional steps to safely restore services based on this data, as well as on case numbers, testing data and other public health information. Any further changes will be considered based on this data in the coming days and weeks.”

	Mass gatherings such as concerts, festivals and major sporting events will not be considered before September 2020, Roussin noted. He also noted that it is key for people to stay home if they are sick to further reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

	Roussin also encouraged businesses to take steps to help staff, patrons and visitors stay safe including:
	•    ensuring people are able to reasonably maintain two metres of distance;
	•    only conducting necessary and brief exchanges within two metres of others;
	•    applying enhanced cleaning protocols, especially in common areas like washrooms;
	•    maintaining physical distancing and food-handling protocols in workplace areas including lunch and common areas;
	•    staying home when feeling sick; and
	•    following personal risk reduction measures.

	Detailed information on the draft plan for Phase Two of service restoration can be found at www.manitoba.ca/covid19/restoring/index.html.

	The Manitoba government is providing $10 million in grants to support 344 projects for community development projects as part of restarting the provincial economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	 

	“We are committed to supporting projects that will help build thriving, sustainable communities and a better future for Manitobans,” said Pallister. “ These grants will help give community organizations a much-needed boost during this unprecedented time and this investment is another way our government is helping rebuild Manitoba’s economy.”

	 

	The premier noted the Manitoba government is increasing this year’s investment by 25 per cent in the Building Sustainable Communities program, which was developed to help provide a high quality of life for Manitobans by responding to neighbourhood, municipal and regional priorities.

	 

	“We are boosting our support for community projects as we work together to rebuild the Manitoba economy,” said Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires. “We know these have been challenging times for many Manitobans, but by working together, we will get through this.”

PROVINCE INTRODUCES NEW RESOURCES TO SUPPORT VICTIMS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE DURING PANDEMIC
					  Texting Services are Available to Those with Safety Concerns: Cox


	The Manitoba government is launching new resources to help those affected by family and intimate partner violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox, minister responsible for the status of women, announced today. 

	 

	“Our government is committed to ensuring victims of family and intimate partner violence know support and shelters are still available during these challenging times, but we also know that not everyone has the technology and safe environment to make a phone call,” said Cox. “The new resources I’m announcing today are intended to let people know help and information is available in a variety of ways.” 

	 

	The province provides funding to support a toll-free crisis line staffed by shelters across Manitoba. The new campaign was created to promote the crisis line and introduce a new texting option.  

	 

	New radio spots, social media ads and posters will remind Manitobans that shelters are still open and help is available through the toll-free line or by texting directly with two shelters. 

	 

	If you have concerns about your safety, call the toll-free crisis line at 1-877-977-0007, text 204-792-5302 or 204-805-6682, or visit www.gov.mb.ca/familyviolence. Crisis lines are confidential and available 24 hours a day. In an emergency, dial 911 or call the local police service.

	 

	“Families isolated together during the COVID-19 pandemic may be experiencing increased tensions, which can lead to a rise in domestic or family violence,” said Cox. “We want anyone who has concerns about their own, or others’ safety to know help is available.” 

	 

	The Family Violence Prevention Program (FVPP) plans and develops community programs that help stop family violence. The program provides funding to community-based organizations that offer special services for abused women and their children and for men living with family violence. There are 33 agencies across Manitoba that provide help for people affected by family violence and the minister recognizes the support of agency partners as experts in the delivery of services.

PROVINCE SUSPENDS PERMITS WITHIN BURNING PERMIT AREA AS PART OF WILDFIRE PREVENTION MEASURES
					  Numerous Wind-Driven Wildfires in Manitoba


	Manitoba Conservation and Climate reports the current risk of wildfire is high across southern and central regions of the province. As a wildfire prevention measure, all provincial burn permits issued under The Wildfires Act within the burning permit area are suspended immediately and no other permits will be issued until further notice.

	 

	There are multiple wildfires burning near the Northern Affairs community of Camperville and Pine Creek First Nation (PCFN). Camperville is located approximately 420 kilometres (km) northwest of Winnipeg and 87 km east of Swan River. PCFN is located north of Camperville. The Canadian Red Cross assisted the PCFN with the evacuation of about 100 people. Most will be returning to the community today. Human-caused wildfires have been reported in several other areas of the province as well.  

	 

	In order to reduce the risk of fire and the risk of exposure to COVID-19 for front-line firefighters, the province is asking the public to be particularly cautious when outdoors to prevent human-caused wildfires. Protecting front-line firefighters and support staff during the COVID-19 pandemic is a top priority to ensure they remain healthy and available to respond to wildfires during the upcoming season.

	 

	The latest information on municipal burn restrictions can be found at www.manitoba.ca/wildfire. Where there is a conflict, consult with a local Manitoba Conservation and Climate office or municipal authority for clarification.

	 

	The public is reminded to never leave an outdoor fire unattended and always extinguish it before leaving. Anyone using an ATV should stay on developed trails, stop frequently to check areas around the engine and exhaust for debris, and carefully dispose of any debris caught in equipment. A small shovel, axe and fire extinguisher should be carried on ATVs at all times. 

	 

	The Manitoba Wildfire Service and the Office of the Fire Commissioner also requests the public’s assistance to support these prevention measures, and to report any wildfires or suspicious activity by calling 911 or the T.I.P. line (toll-free) at 1-800-782-0076 immediately.

MANITOBA CELEBRATES INTERNATIONAL MUSEUM DAY
					  Province Announces Deadline Extension for Fundraising Under Manitoba Heritage Trust Program: Cox


	The province is celebrating International Museum Day by encouraging Manitobans to explore their history with virtual visits to Manitoba museums, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox announced today.

	 

	“I applaud many of our wonderful museums for creating virtual tours, allowing Manitobans to safely enjoy many of the cultural and educational experiences we have to offer,” said Cox. “While we can’t celebrate International Museum Day in the way we usually would, we are very fortunate to have many great online options.”

	 

	A number of Manitoba museums have participated in Manitoba’s Heritage Trust Program, an innovative program that makes $5 million available to museums and heritage organizations available through a matching donation formula.

	 

	In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the provincial government recognizes that many museums and other heritage and cultural organizations are facing unprecedented financial challenges. In an effort to ease some of these pressures, the province is extending the three-year fundraising deadline that was originally established for the Manitoba Heritage Trust Program.

	 

	“Many museums and other groups in our province are facing financial challenges as a result of the pandemic, but by extending the fundraising deadline, we hope to help provide heritage organizations with additional flexibility,” said Cox. “We want to work in partnership with organizations as we all join together to help rebuild our economy.”

	 

	The first phase of Restoring Safe Services: Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap for Recovery allows museums to open their doors under strict public health guidelines. Many museums have opted to remain closed, but there are a wide variety of online options to explore. 

	 

	For more information on all of Manitoba’s museums, visit www.museumsmanitoba.com/.

	 

	International Museum Day is celebrated annually on May 18 and is co-ordinated by the International Council of Museums. The objective is to raise awareness of cultural exchange and development of mutual understanding, co-operation and peace among people.

	 

	Manitoba is home to nearly 200 museums, with more than 40 of those located in the city of Winnipeg.  Museums can be found in every region of the province, with collections that include art and history, science and nature, sports and leisure, transportation and industry.

GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES NEW MANITOBA WORKS CAPITAL INCENTIVE TO SUPPORT RENEWED ECONOMIC GROWTH
					  Program Supports Potential $392-Million Private Capital Project  From Starlight Developments in Downtown Winnipeg: Eichler


	The province is unveiling the Manitoba Works Capital Incentive, a new approach to tax increment financing (TIF) that levers incremental education property tax rebates to stimulate economic growth and job creation, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	 

	“This new program in Manitoba’s investment support tool kit will bring business investment and jobs to the province, and help achieve the objectives set out in the provincial Economic Growth Action Plan,” said Eichler. “The Manitoba Works Capital Incentive demonstrates that our province continues to be open for business during these challenging economic times.”  

	 

	The Manitoba Works Capital Incentive also encourages business development during the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. A new or existing business interested in getting established or expanding in Manitoba may apply to the program if: 

	• the business is prepared to make a minimum capital investment of $10 million to a specific property, which will be designated for tax increment financing benefits; 

	• a minimum of 65 per cent of total project costs are from private sources; and 

	• there is demonstrable potential to create and/or maintain jobs in Manitoba, or the new business activity will have a substantial and measurable net economic benefit to the province.

	 

	The first project to be announced under the program will lever a potential $392-million private capital investment and create 450 new jobs to redevelop the Portage Place mall in downtown Winnipeg, through a rebate of up to $28.7 million over 20 years. The Starlight Developments project will convert Portage Place into a mixed-use complex that includes student housing as well as larger-family Indigenous student housing, retail and services, and will transform its street presence to become more connected to the surrounding area while increasing safety.

	 

	The Manitoba Works Capital Incentive carries no risk in that it provides no up-front money to the developer, and the province pays only what is collected in incremental education property tax as a result of the development. 

	 

	Historically, Manitoba used TIF to promote investment in community revitalization projects, among other uses. In December 2018, the province began refocusing the program toward economic development and moving to increase transparency with a whole-of-government approach to project reviews. The new Manitoba Works Capital Incentive framework provides clear parameters and aligns with the province’s mandate to champion Manitoba as an ideal location for business investment and expansion.  

	 

	The government has committed to phase out education property tax in order to relieve property owners of this burden and to align Manitoba with other provinces. Rebates provided through the Manitoba Works Capital Incentive will support significant development during the phase-out period and will provide a competitive tax advantage to stimulate economic growth, the minister added.

PROVINCE SHINING A LIGHT ON DARK FIBRE FOR RURAL BROADBAND SERVICES
					  Pandemic Underscores Need for Innovative Use of Unused Fibre-Optic Capacity to Improve Rural and Northern Connectivity:  Wharton


	The Manitoba government is looking to jumpstart broadband availability in rural and northern communities by making use of the vast fibre-optic network that Manitobans have already built, but is almost entirely unused, or ‘dark’, Crown Services Minister Jeff Wharton announced today.  

	“The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of broadband connectivity and the need to ensure people across the province have access to critical information, such as distance learning programs or internet-based mental health services,” said Wharton. “We want to help close the telecommunication gap in our province to better connect rural, remote and Indigenous communities, improve safety and access to information and learning resources.”

	This will be the first time that Manitoba has sought to use a broad-based, provincewide request for proposals (RFP) for companies to leverage Manitoba’s under-used fibre-optic network to improve broadband services in rural, remote, Indigenous and northern communities.

	Through Manitoba Hydro, the province owns thousands of kilometres of fibre-optic cable across the province. The network was created to communicate with northern hydroelectric facilities and transmit data. However, much of it has never been used, with no plans for use in the future.

	“By allowing qualified carriers and providers to tap into this fibre-optic capacity, we will make use of an existing resource rather than building new infrastructure,” said Wharton. “This network will allow providers to offer or improve service to the significant number of rural and remote communities in Manitoba that are largely underserved by high-speed, competitive and reliable telecommunications.”

	The province plans to work with these assets and a qualified telecommunications company (or companies) to:
	•    improve access to broadband and support further implementation of technologies that are capable of evolving to ‘next generation’ to keep pace with growing data needs; and
	•    improve cellular service across long stretches of transportation corridors and in communities that are currently without cellular service, which poses a safety risk to Manitobans.

	Manitoba issued a request for qualifications (RFQ) last fall to seek carriers and other providers who could use existing infrastructure to make services available in communities across rural and northern Manitoba. The RFQ was used to pre-qualify and create a shortlist of up to five proponents, who are assisting the province in defining the scope and scale of this opportunity and informing the planned RFP.  

	The province is preparing the RFP and plans to post it in late spring or early summer, the minister noted.

					  New Measures Extend Deadlines, Reduce Regulatory Burdens: Pallister


	The Manitoba government is introducing additional temporary orders to extend deadlines, social service and child-care provisions, and reduce municipal government regulatory burdens to help address the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Due to the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are instituting new emergency orders to allow for greater flexibility during this time and give Manitobans the time they need to work around the interruptions this pandemic has caused,” said Pallister. 

	A state of emergency has been declared by the powers set out in Section 10(1) and 10(2) of The Emergency Measures Act. The additional orders will ensure continued access to services for Manitobans during the state of emergency in Manitoba due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as:
	•    extending deadlines to apply for the 2019 farmland school tax rebate and to appeal tax assessments to the earlier of Sept. 21, 2020, or the end of the state of emergency associated with COVID-19;
	•    providing exemptions to current license requirements for child care so that early childhood educators can offer child care in their homes and in the community for families who need it during the current state of emergency;
	•    suspending municipal byelections during the current state of emergency, as well as reducing municipal council meeting quorum requirements to provide greater flexibility for local governments;
	•    temporarily suspending meeting provisions for condominium corporations, co-operatives, corporations and credit unions and introducing measures to allow electronic attendance, delivery of notices and voting by other means;
	•    introducing temporary suspensions for in-person commissioning and witnessing provisions related to oaths, affirmation, statutory declarations, health-care directives, powers of attorney, land titles documents and wills; and
	•    temporarily suspending fees for marriage fees, licences and marriage commissioners if the person has an expired licence issued after Dec. 19, 2019.

	The province has the ability to revoke any of the above orders sooner than stated if it deems necessary. To review the new orders, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19/soe.html.

CAMPING SEASON KICKS OFF, REMINDER TO PRACTISE SOCIAL DISTANCING IN PARKS, CAMPGROUNDS AND COTTAGES


Backgrounder
Background Information


	As Manitobans and visitors make their plans for the upcoming May long-weekend, the province is reminding those who are heading out to provincial parks, campgrounds, or their cottage to follow the advice of Manitoba’s chief public health officer and practise proper social distancing. This is especially important in public areas, such as campgrounds, trails, beaches, playgrounds, washrooms and shower buildings.

	Frequent cleaning and sanitization of washrooms and shower facilities within provincial parks will be in place to ensure visitors have a safe and positive experience. However, campers are asked to bring their own supplies, including items such as soap, sanitizer, hygiene products and toilet paper, to campgrounds, yurts and cabins. They are also reminded to pack required prescription drugs and medical supplies, and water shoes or sandals for use in shower facilities.

	Campers should buy their park entry passes online ahead of time and be sure to print their campground reservation. At this time, to limit personal contact, reservation holders can proceed directly to their campsite when they arrive. Walk-up customers will still need to check in at the camp office.

	A reminder that gatherings of more than 10 people are not permitted at this time and is best to limit interactions to people within your own household. This includes socializing with neighbouring sites.

	Manitobans who feel unwell should stay at home, and return home immediately if they feel ill or experience symptoms that may be COVID-19 related.  Do not use local health providers unless it is an emergency. In addition, travel is not permitted from southern Manitoba to areas, including campgrounds, north of the 53rd parallel. This is essentially anywhere north of the northern edge of Lake Winnipeg.

	Due to the cool spring, some campgrounds may not have all the usual amenities operational this weekend. There is still a lot of snow on the ground at Paint Lake, Wekusko Falls and Grass River campgrounds, so nightly camping will not be available yet. However, the yurts at Paint Lake will be open. Water lines are not ready yet in Big Whiteshell Provincial Campground, which affects modern washrooms and showers. Water will be available from a water tank at the campground office.

	Key reminders of what is different in Manitoba campgrounds and cottage country at this time:
	•    buy provincial park entry passes online before leaving home;
	•    print campground reservation confirmations and go directly to the reserved site;
	•    practise social distancing;
	•    no gatherings of more than 10 people;
	•    bring supplies of hygiene items such as soap and toilet paper;
	•    pack out trash when leaving; and
	•    no travel from southern Manitoba to north of the 53rd parallel.

	Conservation officers and park patrol officers will be enforcing the emergency public health orders within provincial parks. Campground attendants and park staff will also provide education and monitor compliance.
	 
	Cottagers are reminded to limit the number of additional contacts made as part of their trip. Gather supplies and fuel up near home if possible, and avoid any extra stops along the way. In addition, stay home if feeling sick, because getting ill in a smaller centre could quickly overwhelm the local health facility.
	 
	Another important annual reminder for campers is that since the emerald ash borer has been confirmed in Winnipeg, and Winnipeg remains designated as a federally regulated area, firewood cannot be moved out of Winnipeg. Anyone caught transporting firewood could be fined/charged up to $1,300 for individuals or $15,000 for businesses.

May 14, 2020
NEW REGULATION ENABLES DESIGNATED PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS TO ENFORCE EMERGENCY PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH HAZARD ORDERS


	The Manitoba government is designating additional provincial government officials to enforce public health emergency orders and emergency health hazard orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“As we slowly and carefully begin to restart our economy and loosen some restrictions on non-essential services and businesses, there will be a need for additional supports to enforce the current measures in place,” said Pallister. “We have authorized additional provincial personnel to ensure we have the capacity for enforcement if necessary to help keep Manitobans healthy and safe and keep our COVID curve flat.”

	The Additional Enforcement Personnel Regulation, enacted under The Public Heath Act, provides authority to government officials designated in the regulation to enforce public health emergency orders and emergency health hazard orders. This includes:
	•    safety and health officers under The Workplace Safety and Health Act;
	•    inspectors under The Liquor Gaming and Cannabis Control Act;
	•    public health officers appointed under The Public Health Act;
	•    park patrol officers under The Provincial Parks Act; and
	•    public health officers within Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development including food safety inspectors, animal health inspectors and animal protection officers.

	In addition, with the assistance of Manitoba Conservation officers, who already have the ability to enforce these orders, provincial park patrol officers will be able to enforce public health emergency orders related to public travel, social distancing and gathering size.

	In all, more than 3,000 provincial and municipal personnel can be deployed to enforce COVID-related orders. These officials will operate in their regular roles and provide education and warnings to businesses in their sectors as required. As with other enforcement agencies, tickets will be issued as a last resort.

	Other agencies that are able to enforce these orders include:
	•    RCMP, Winnipeg Police Service, Brandon Police Service and other municipal police agencies;
	•    community safety officers;
	•    First Nations safety officers; and
	•    bylaw enforcement officers.

	Complementing formal enforcement efforts is Operation Safe Apart, which provides an operational framework for the overall enforcement. Operation Safe Apart includes the recruitment of volunteers to assist with public awareness and education with respect to public health orders (PHOs), and refer matters for formal enforcement as necessary. These efforts can be undertaken by a number of organizations including City of Winnipeg community safety ambassadors, Citizens on Patrol (COPP) and the Bear Clan in co-ordination with provincial and municipal officials.

	In the coming days, the Help Next Door MB website and app will be updated to include a section that will assist in matching municipalities with volunteers. Further information will be available at https://helpnextdoormb.ca/.

	In Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made by calling 311, by email at 311@winnipeg.ca or on Twitter @cityofwinnipeg.

	Outside of Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made to the Manitoba Government Inquiry line at 204-945-3744, (toll-free) at 1-866-626-4862 or by email at mgi@gov.mb.ca.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO THE MANITOBA CIVIL SERVICE SENIOR LEADERSHIP


	Premier Brian Pallister announced today the appointment of David McLaughlin as clerk of the executive council and secretary to cabinet as well as deputy minister for the Climate and Green Plan Implementation Office, following the departure of Fred Meier to become president of Red River College.

	“Mr. McLaughlin is more than qualified to take on this new leadership role for Manitoba,” said Pallister. “His vast experience in government at both the provincial and federal levels and knowledge of the Manitoba government’s needs and priorities, make him the right choice and fit to serve as clerk at this time.”

	McLaughlin brings over 30 years of government experience at both provincial and federal levels and in both political and public service settings. He has more than a decade of service at the deputy minister level including four years in the executive council office of the government of New Brunswick, where he served as deputy minister of policy and planning and secretary to the Cabinet Committee on Policy and Priorities. McLaughlin served as deputy minister of intergovernmental affairs and deputy minister to the commission on legislative democracy, also in New Brunswick. He was also executive director to the Council of the Federation’s Panel on Fiscal Imbalance.

	McLaughlin was president and CEO of the independent National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, a deputy-level position in the federal government. He is an acknowledged public policy expert in the field of climate and sustainability policy, and an honorary fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. Most recently, he was director of climate change at the International Institute for Sustainable Development.

	“David’s knowledge and expertise in the fields of climate change and sustainable development is well-known across Canada, and Manitoba will benefit from him taking on this additional role of deputy minister leading our province’s Climate and Green Plan Implementation Office,” said Pallister.

	McLaughlin has served in a number of other federal and provincial offices including the Prime Minister’s Office, office of the federal minister of finance, and the office of the premier of Manitoba. He is a published author, and speaks English and French.

	Pallister thanked Fred Meier for his public service and dedication to Manitobans in his more than two-decade career in the provincial public service to date.

	McLaughlin takes up his new duties effective May 20.

PROVINCE HELPS CONNECT MANITOBA BUSINESSES WITH PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
					  B2B Manitoba Will Assist Businesses With Reopening and Economic Recovery: Pallister


	The Manitoba government has partnered with the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, the Manitoba and Winnipeg Chambers of Commerce, and North Forge Technology Exchange to support the development and launch of an online marketplace to connect Manitoba businesses with non-medical grade personal protective equipment (PPE) and other materials needed for businesses to operate, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Our government has heard from the business community that they need help to access supplies needed to enable them to open and operate safely during the pandemic,” said Pallister. “We are proud to join forces with our trusted partners in the business and technology community to launch B2B Manitoba, a tool that will connect businesses with suppliers.”

	The province has provided a grant of $422,000 to the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, which have commissioned North Forge Technology Exchange to develop and launch the online marketplace www.B2BManitoba.ca. This tool is a made-in-Manitoba solution that addresses a need identified by Manitoba businesses as they transition to economic recovery phases of COVID-19.

	“The manufacturing sector, key to Manitoba’s economy, has stepped up in a significant way to make needed protective supplies,” said Ron Koslowsky, divisional vice-president of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters (CME). “As the association representing manufacturers, CME is pleased to support this valuable initiative which will help businesses, their staff and customers operate safely as we help get Manitobans back to work.”

	“The Manitoba Chambers of Commerce is excited about the opportunity this new tool will create for suppliers in Manitoba and, more importantly, for small business owners that are experiencing significant challenges in reopening their businesses in a manner that will be safe for both employees and consumers,” said Chuck Davidson, president and CEO of the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce.

	“Ensuring the well-being of employees and customers is the business community’s top priority,” said Loren Remillard, president and CEO, the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce. “Having the right equipment and procedures in place enables healthy workplaces and the public confidence needed for all phases of Manitoba’s reopening plan. We’re proud to be a partner in this innovative approach to match local need with local supply for the benefit of all Manitobans.”

	In addition, this online marketplace will support those critical businesses that never closed with restocking needed supplies and will help manufacturers who have retooled their current operations to produce PPE and are looking for ways to access a new customer base.

	The online marketplace will be monitored by the Manitoba and Winnipeg Chambers of Commerce and the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters to protect against spam and abuse. They will also ensure that any listings for medical grade PPE are redirected to the provincial government’s PPE portal.

	Developed by Winnipeg-based firm Permission Click, www.B2BManitoba.ca will be secured with the same level of encryption used by leading financial institutions and government agencies so businesses and suppliers can be assured their data is fully protected when using the site.

	“As a key innovation partner for the province of Manitoba, we are proud to deliver another made-in-Manitoba tech solution,” said Joelle Foster, CEO of North Forge Technology Exchange. “This solution is innovative and innovation is what North Forge does best.”

	“In times of need, Manitobans always face the storm together,” said Pallister. “I want to thank our partners, our business community and all Manitobans for everything they are doing and continue to do as we fight COVID-19 and work to restore safe services. Because of our collective efforts, we will emerge from this pandemic strong and united.”

	The provincial government has established the new Premier’s Economic Opportunities Advisory Board to chart Manitoba’s course for reopening its economy and renewing its growth in order to move the province forward from the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“This board of leaders in sectors including business, technology, financial services and training will draw on its expertise to provide advice to the government on leading Manitoba’s renewed growth following the public health crisis,” said Pallister. “Its members will work as a team to find opportunities for economic recovery and growth, based on the strengths of Manitobans and the province’s communities and industries so Manitoba emerges stronger and more resilient than ever before.”

	The 18-member advisory board also includes leaders in Manitoba in transportation, real estate, agriculture, education and manufacturing, among a range of other sectors. With a mandate of 18 months, it will advise the government on ways to harness private-sector capital and investment to recover and create jobs and economic growth across the province, the premier noted.

	The Premier’s Economic Opportunities Advisory Board will examine the potential creation of new growth hubs and economic clusters, in addition to networks in which businesses and communities would collaborate to support investment, trade and job creation. The plan includes identifying opportunities to transform government policies, programs, regulations, and services to support a fast recovery and renewed economic growth, and a further alignment of post-secondary programs and courses with the province’s labour market needs and priorities.

	“This team of leaders will provide the best possible direction for unleashing private-sector capital and investment for our province,” said Pallister. “The way forward is to foster entrepreneurship and technological growth toward longer-term economic resilience and sustainability.”

	The premier was pleased to announce that Curt Vossen, president and CEO of Richardson International, has agreed to serve as chair of the board.

	“I look forward to the prospect of working together to identify and articulate economic opportunities for Manitoba,” said Vossen.

	The board will report to the premier, and will be supported by staff of Executive Council, the Economic Development Office and the Office of the Clerk of the Executive Council and Cabinet Secretary to ensure a whole-of-government approach.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT TO LOWER VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES BY 10 PER CENT
					  $11-Million Program Will Save Manitobans Money: Wharton


	The Manitoba government is continuing to support Manitoba families with an $11-million program that will reduce vehicle registration fees by 10 per cent beginning July 1, Crown Services Minister Jeff Wharton announced today.

	“After your home, your car is likely your next biggest expense, and reducing these fees is another step toward making life more affordable for Manitobans,” said Wharton. “As a result of COVID-19, we’re working hard across government and with our partners to find ways to provide relief to Manitobans who need it now more than ever.”

	Most Manitobans will benefit from a $15 decrease to the existing $154 vehicle registration fee as a first step to reverse a 30 per cent increase in these fees in 2012 by the previous administration, the minister noted. The registration fee applies to non-commercial vehicles and trucks, resulting in an annual registration fee of $139. Non-commercial vehicles include passenger cars, sport utility vehicles, light trucks, farm vehicles, motorcycles/mopeds and personal-use trailers and trucks. The existing fee for the registration of government and municipal vehicles will continue. 

	Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) administers and collects vehicle registration fees on behalf of the provincial government.

	“These savings are in addition to the up to $110 million in rebate cheques that MPI is returning to its policyholders at the end of May to early June,” said Wharton. “With a healthy reserve fund and fewer claims during this COVID-19 period, MPI is in a strong financial situation to move forward with these rebate cheques to support Manitobans.”

	Rebates are based on what policyholders paid last year and is expected to be around 11 per cent, or between $140 to $160, per average policyholder.

To be considered, the lawyer must have demonstrated outstanding practice, shown integrity and leadership, made contributions to excellence in the profession and been in practice for at least 10 years, the minister noted.

	Cullen noted the advisory council includes representatives from the judiciary, legal community and the public. It is chaired by Chief Justice Richard Chartier of the Manitoba Court of Appeal and includes representatives from the Law Society of Manitoba and the Manitoba Bar Association. Joy Loewen, Andrea Martens and Dr. William Pope are the public representatives.

	The practice of Queen’s counsel appointments in Manitoba stopped in 2001. The Queen’s Counsel Act, passed in 2018, restored Queen’s counsel appointments with a new and transparent eligibility criteria for lawyers in Manitoba.

	A formal ceremony in honour of this year’s Queen’s counsel recipients will be postponed until a later date due to COVID-19.

PROVINCE INCREASES INVESTMENT TO $10 MILLION FOR GREEN TEAM PROJECTS

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is providing up to $10 million, nearly double the amount invested in 2019, to support community organizations, municipalities and provincial parks delivering Green Team projects this upcoming summer, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“We recognize the important role played by community-based organizations across the province in building communities that are thriving and sustainable,” said Pallister. “This investment will help students gain critical work experience, support employers during the response and recovery phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, and build our economy.”

	Green Team grants are awarded to non-profit organizations and municipal governments to hire youth and young adults to work on community projects between May and August.

	To aid in Manitoba’s COVID-19 recovery efforts, Green Team funding of up to $10 million is expected to support over 2,000 jobs. To receive funding, organizations must comply with physical distancing requirements and practices for the pandemic as directed by the chief provincial public health officer. Organizations that cannot comply with public health orders will be invited to resubmit alternative work proposals that engage employees in meaningful work that supports community and economic development.

	“Green Team grants benefit our communities while giving young Manitobans excellent opportunities to gain valuable work experience,” said Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires.  “Projects are incredibly diverse, providing non-profit organizations with 100 per cent of wage costs and municipal governments with 50 per cent of wage costs.”

	The program is split into multiple streams including urban (Winnipeg) and hometown (all other municipalities), as well as provincial parks that will provide jobs for people between the ages of 15 and 29.

	Participants will work on a variety of community development projects that improve neighbourhoods, promote community involvement and help develop young leaders. Green Team funding through Manitoba Conservation and Climate also supports provincial parks by creating positions for applicants interested in working with wildlife or in forestry, or in assisting at interpretive centres.

	To further enhance Manitoba’s economic recovery, the province has reopened the intake for Green Team.

STATEMENT FROM PREMIER BRIAN PALLISTER ON MANITOBA'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY


	The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of Manitoba becoming a province. During those 15 decades, people from all over the world have come to our keystone province in search for a safer, more prosperous life for themselves and their families. They found it here in Manitoba, their home of hope.

	They found a tolerant society that continues to welcome people from every region of the world, regardless of their age, gender, religion or sexual preference. They found a compassionate society that faces its challenges together, consistently leading the nation in volunteerism and support of charities. They found an inclusive society, composed of a diverse mosaic of cultures, customs and languages. They found a society of freedom and opportunity, where the only obstacle to achieving your potential is the size of your dreams.  

	Their story is our story and it is the story of the approximately 10,000 newcomers who become Canadian citizens each year in our province. Manitobans will always embrace them with open arms and open hearts, welcoming them to our Manitoba family.

	As we look to the future, our talented workforce, our diversified economy and our unshakeable respect for human rights ensures that Manitoba will continue to be the envy of the world.

	It is often said the only thing better than today in Manitoba is tomorrow in Manitoba. I know that is true because of the many people making meaningful contributions to our province’s economy and society. Manitobans of all races and religions, working together each day to build an even brighter future for themselves, for their families, for their neighbours and for future generations of Manitobans.

	We are united in celebration; we are united in hope. We are united.

PROVINCE STARTS PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS ON MUNICIPAL CODES OF CONDUCT AND E-LICENSING REGULATIONS


	The Manitoba government is set to undertake a 45-day online public consultation on regulatory changes, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires and Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“Manitoba was one of the first jurisdictions in Canada to require municipalities to adopt a council code of conduct, and The Municipal Amendment Act and Council Members’ Codes of Conduct regulation clearly demonstrate our intention to remain a leader on this important issue,” said Squires. “The act strengthens council members’ codes of conduct and mandates training on respectful conduct for all council members.”

	The Council Members’ Codes of Conduct regulation defines the minimum contents of council codes of conduct, standardizes the code of conduct complaints process, expands the list of sanctions and remedial measures available to address code of conduct violations, and institutes an appeals process.

	“E-Licensing fits into Manitoba’s red tape reduction initiative by simplifying the license purchase process.” said Pedersen. “E-licensing allows the public to purchase their license with the push of a button, anywhere, anytime, allowing more time for individuals to enjoy the great outdoors.”

	Amendments are being proposed to both the General Hunting Regulation and the Fishing Licensing Regulation to fully implement the functionality of angling and hunting licenses under the new electronic and online licensing system (e-licensing) for anglers and hunters. E-licensing allows for access 24 hours a day, seven days a week online and the ability to immediately purchase and print licenses and permits at home.

	The Manitoba government is using the Manitoba Regulatory Consultation Portal for the public consultation. This platform provides the public online access to the proposed regulations, as well as the ability to submit comments and is a part of government’s regulatory accountability initiative.

	Stakeholders and the public can browse and comment on the consultation materials by visiting https://reg.gov.mb.ca/home.

STATEMENT FROM HEALTH, SENIORS AND ACTIVE LIVING MINISTER CAMERON FRIESEN ON NATIONAL NURSING WEEK - MAY 11 TO 17, 2020


	Born on May 12, 1820, Florence Nightingale revolutionized the profession of nursing by encouraging the development of standards of practice and formalized education. Now, 200 years after her birth, the World Health Organization has recognized the vital importance of nursing by designating this year the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife.

	As we mark National Nursing Week in Canada from May 11 to 17, I want to thank each and every nurse for the hard work, dedication and sacrifices they are making to care for others. Your jobs are not easy. You work long hours, facing great physical and emotional demands, especially during COVID-19. Your skills and expertise improve the quality of life for your patients, and help keep them well. Your leadership is key to the strength of our health-care system.

	A system we have also been working to strengthen following long-overdue changes designed to improve patient care. We have been engaged with health system leadership to stabilize and reinforce the province’s nursing workforce and to implement our campaign pledge to hire a minimum of 200 more nurses.

	It is a commitment we have honoured and our historic investments in health-care are producing results. I am pleased to say there were a total of 409 new nurse hires in all provincial health regions since June 1, 2019.

	In an effort to protect nurses during COVID-19, we have provided health-care staff paid administrative leave to compensate health-care workers who are required to self-isolate due to possible exposure to COVID-19 and to help ease workloads; we made it easier for former registered nurses to apply for an expedited temporary registration during the pandemic.

	This year, May 14 also marks Indigenous Nurses Day in Canada. I want to thank Indigenous nurses across Manitoba for the invaluable care they provide their patients and the leadership they provide to their communities.

	We also remain committed to the midwifery model and expanding the services throughout Manitoba.

	To all nurses and, particularly those new to the profession, know that today and every day we celebrate your achievements and your commitment to caring for others.

	The contributions nurses make to the health, safety and well-being of all Manitobans, as well as their work on the front lines of this pandemic, are greatly appreciated by myself, our government and people across the province. Thank you.

PROVINCE ADOPTS NEW OIL AND GAS REPORTING SYSTEM


	The Manitoba government is implementing a new system for Manitoba’s oil and gas industry to streamline reporting, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“The implementation of the Petrinex system in Manitoba will allow us to leverage current industry standard technology to modernize our oil and gas facility, production and emissions data collection as well as data audit processes,” said Pedersen. “Adopting the Petrinex system will also bring Manitoba in line with other Western Canadian jurisdictions who are using the same system.”

	Petrinex is a joint strategic organization supporting Canada’s upstream, midstream and downstream petroleum industry and is currently represented by all provinces in Western Canada. Petrinex facilitates efficient, standardized, safe and accurate management, and exchange of information essential to the operation of the petroleum sector.

	Benefits anticipated for the oil and gas industry in Manitoba include:
	•    increased standardization of business and operational processes between Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia;
	•    having a single venue for access to timely, accurate and secure data;
	•    tools to assure submissions for government and Industry processes are correct and complete; and
	•    the ability to conduct partner reporting in a standard, effective, electronic venue.

	“The objective of using Petrinex is to ensure timely and accurate reporting of industry’s oil and gas activities, and ultimately an improved system for the payment of taxes and royalties,” said Pedersen. “We have been working closely with the industry over the past year to ensure the system will work for Manitoba.”

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT FLOWING FUNDING FASTER TO MUNICIPALITIES
					  Unconditional Operating Grants Allow Municipalities to Invest in Local Priorities: Squires


	The province is speeding up the pace of funding to Manitoba municipalities to help with the unprecedented economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires announced today.

	“Many Manitobans are facing tough financial times and our government has committed to flowing faster a large portion of municipal funding grants in recognition of immediate pressures that municipalities are facing as a result of COVID-19,” said Squires. “We want to provide certainty to municipalities to help maintain critical essential services such as emergency personnel, even as we face unprecedented financial pressure as a provincial government.”

	The province is flowing 75 per cent of its municipal operating grants directly to municipalities, with the remainder to be provided in the fall.

	“These grants are considered unconditional and municipalities can utilize the funding according to local priorities,” said Squires. “I look forward to continued collaboration and partnership with municipalities, for the benefit of all Manitobans.”

	This builds on the province’s earlier commitment to maintaining funding levels to municipalities as promised in Budget 2020.

	In all, the province provides a total of $172.6 million in operating funding to municipalities as well a total of $137 million for municipal infrastructure, and funding for other strategic priorities such as policing, public safety and solid waste reduction.

	“Municipalities are on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting local communities and delivering essential services,” said Ralph Groening, president of the Association of Manitoba Municipalities. “Providing a larger portion of operating funding up front will certainly help alleviate the tremendous financial pressures on our members. We commend the Province of Manitoba for providing this timely assistance.”

	Full details Restoring Safe Services: Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap to Recoveryare available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/restoring/ and businesses with questions on restoring their services should visit https://engagemb.ca.

	Maintaining critical funding to municipalities is one of the ways the provincial government continues to support directly Manitoba communities. In March, the province announced nearly $8 million in one-time funding for spring flood preparedness projects in 83 municipalities.

	Manitoba has invested more than $900 million under the Manitoba Protection Plan in the fight against COVID-19. In addition, the province has announced a number of measures in order to provide financial relief for Manitobans including:
	•    Ensuring up to $110 million is returned to Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) policyholders. Rebates are expected to be around 11 per cent, or between $140 to $160 per average policyholder.
	•    Providing up to $120 million to support Manitoba’s small and medium-sized businesses through the Manitoba Gap Protection Program (MGPP). The province will advance each eligible business the non-interest bearing forgivable MGPP loan of $6,000, for a total of up to $120 million.
	•    Returning the $37-million Workers Compensation Board (WCB) surplus to eligible Manitoba employers. This month, eligible employers will receive a credit to their account based on
	20 per cent of their 2019 premium. WCB expects $29 million will be returned to the private sector, with approximately $7 million going to small businesses in Manitoba.

PROVINCE LIFTS ONE-MONTH LIMIT ON FILLING OF PRESCRIPTIONS
					  Province Creates New Working Group to Restrict Drugs Known to be in Short Supply: Friesen

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is lifting the one-month supply limit on prescription drugs, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	Effective May 11, Manitobans who have prescriptions for long-term medications will be able to fill them as per their prescriber’s directions up to a three-month supply, if the drug is not affected by shortages.

	In March, the government moved to restrict prescription fills to one month in response to global drug shortages. This move was consistent with all provinces and territories, and was in response to advice received from the Canadian Pharmacists Association and Canadian Association for Pharmaceutical Distributors and Management.

	In Manitoba, these limits were imposed on March 19. This was done to minimize potential distribution shortages and prevent people from stockpiling medication due in part to messaging from the federal government to Canadians. Another contributing factor is the typically high volume of dispensing that occurs at the end of Manitoba’s Pharmacare Program year, which is in late March.

	“While this decision to restrict prescription fills to one month was necessary, we have been monitoring carefully the consequences and recognize the impact this has had on many Manitobans,” said Friesen. “As a result, our government is pleased to be removing the one-month limit now that the global and domestic drug supply is showing to be more stable.”

	Friesen noted today’s announcement builds on other measures the government has taken to minimize the financial pressure caused as a result of the policy.

	“Our government acted early and announced shortly after placing the limit on prescription fills, pharmacare rates would be frozen at last year’s level, and users would see no increase to their pharmacare deductible,” said Friesen.

	The minister also announced the immediate establishment of a time-limited, COVID-19 drug shortage working group which will be comprised of provincial officials, as well as representatives from Pharmacists Manitoba and the College of Pharmacists of Manitoba.

	This working group will be responsible for ongoing surveillance and monitoring of drug availability in the province. This work will allow the group to make evidence-based decisions as to what drugs should continue to only be dispensed in one-month allotments. The work of the group will be guided by Health Canada’s list of drugs in short supply that can be found at www.drugshortagescanada.ca. The working group will also solicit for proposals from industry, stakeholder groups and health-related associations to make evidence-based decisions in a collaborative format.

	To ensure Manitobans can benefit from this financial relief, while also allowing the working group to begin their work, only drugs currently listed in short supply on the federal government’s drug shortages website will be subject to the one-month fill limit. Pharmacists will be able to advise their clients about which specific drugs are in short supply and might be subject to dispensing limits.

	Further to the announcement, the minister noted Manitobans who have experienced a significant change in their income can have their Manitoba Pharmacare Program deductible reviewed. Individuals can estimate their income for the current year, which in turn will set a new deductible for that same year. Following the filing of the individual’s income taxes for the current year, the projected income is then compared to the actual income and the difference is reconciled. To have a Manitoba pharmacare deductible reviewed, call 204-786-7141 or (toll-free) at 1-800-297-8099, or by emailing pharmacare@gov.mb.ca.

	Pharmacists Manitoba is asking their clients to appropriately refill their medications, such as not refilling more than 10 days before their next scheduled refill, and not requesting quantities in excess of 100 days’ supply, to help maintain the drug supply going forward.

	To help ease the financial burden on seniors, the Manitoba government also announced May 5, the Seniors Economic Recovery Credit which will provide every Manitoban aged 65 and older with a one-time, refundable tax credit of $200.

PROVINCE ORDERING UP TO ONE MILLION MADE-IN-MANITOBA REUSABLE N95 MASKS
					  Locally Designed and Produced Masks a Manitoba Success Story: Helwer


	The Manitoba government is planning to purchase up to one million made-in-Manitoba N95 reusable silicone masks, Central Services Minister Reg Helwer announced today.

	“Providing high-quality personal protective equipment to our front-line health-care workers is a priority for our government,” said Helwer. “It is very exciting that we are able to place an order for these reusable N95 masks that were designed and are being produced right here in Manitoba.”

	In early April, the government issued an Expression of Interest to determine the interest and capability of manufacturers to complete the manufacturing of reusable N95 masks designed and refined by Manitobans Dr. Christian Petropolis and Dr. Adrian Robertson. The masks are designed to meet the needs of front-line health-care workers who need reliable and comfortable protection. They can also be sterilized after use, allowing them to be reused up to 30 times. Petropolis and Robertson have made their design open source so that others can more quickly access and manufacture this innovative, reusable mask.

	After receiving proposals from across the country, Winnipeg-based Precision ADM was selected to finalize the design and produce it in Manitoba at a cost competitive with similar masks produced overseas.

	“As a physician, not only do I recognize the critical role our front-line workers have in meeting the health-care needs of Manitobans, they are also my friends, family and colleagues,” said Petropolis, a Winnipeg-based physician and surgeon who developed the design for this reusable mask. “In this time of need, I was happy that I could be of assistance in providing an option with this silicone mask. I have been incredibly impressed with the response of the province as this initiative would not have moved forward without the foresight in funding a locally developed and produced mask.”

	“We owe it to the front-line care providers to keep them safe and maintain their confidence in their protective equipment,” added Robertson, medical director of intermediate intensive care at Health Sciences Centre, who led the testing of this new mask design. “This massive co-operative effort between the government of Manitoba, medicine and industry is ensuring we can meet that obligation.”

	The Manitoba government has placed an initial order with Precision ADM for 500,000 of the masks, with an option to purchase an additional 500,000 masks over the next 14 months.

	“In these unprecedented times, we are all doing our best to stay safe and help our community in any way we can and, as proud Manitobans, Precision ADM is honoured to have the opportunity to manufacture these essential reusable N95 masks for our front line workers,” said Martin Petrak, co-founder and CEO of Precision ADM. “Working with our Manitoba-based partners BOMImed, Melet Plastics Inc., and the Orthopaedic Innovation Centre, we will create a reliable new Canadian secure supply chain to fight COVID-19.”

	“This is an extraordinary success story for our province,” Helwer said. “By working together and harnessing the ingenuity of Manitobans, we’re helping keep Manitobans safe and healthy in the face of this global pandemic.”

	The Manitoba government continues to call on manufacturers, businesses and other organizations to assist in procurement efforts.

	The province is asking manufacturers or businesses to visit the COVID-19 portal at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/index.html if:
	•    they can rapidly scale up production or retool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19; or
	•    they have a stock of personal protective equipment that is not being used due to closures and physical distancing.

	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition. More information can be found at https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is providing more than $50,000 in grants for 11 new projects that will extend the life of military memorials across the province through the Military Memorial Conservation Grant, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox announced today.

	“Military memorials are places of reflection and commemoration that give us an opportunity to honour the sacrifices of those who came before us,” said Cox. “These projects will help to ensure aging memorials throughout Manitoba are preserved for future generations.”

	The province established the Military Memorials Conservation Fund last year with an initial investment of $2 million to provide annual grants toward war memorial conservation projects including statues, plaques and other tributes throughout Manitoba. The fund is managed by The Winnipeg Foundation.

	The grant is intended to assist primarily with conservation work on existing military memorials in Manitoba, with the goal of extending the physical life and commemorative function of the memorials.

	The minister noted priority this year was given to projects related to the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.

	“As time marches on, it’s still so important to remember and honour the sacrifices made for us in the Second World War,” Cox said. “That’s why the Manitoba government is committed to preserving these important memorials, which provide opportunities to reflect and give thanks.”

	Private donations from organizations, communities and veterans’ groups help to ensure Manitoba’s military memorials are properly preserved for future generations. The fund is expected to generate $100,000 annually, the minister noted.

	It is estimated there are more than 200 military memorials of varying types across the province, ranging from 20 to 100 years old, and many of the memorials require repair and maintenance.

	More information about the fund and how to apply for a grant is available at:

	Thousands and thousands of courageous young Canadians left our shores – with many never to return.

	 

	The legacy of the sacrifices that were made on our behalf is a freedom that resonates from coast to coast to coast with each and every sunrise.

	On the evening on Jan. 11, 2019, Williams was approached by Winnipeg Police Service officers and was chased on foot. At the end of the pursuit, the officers confronted Williams, who produced a weapon and was shot by police. Winnipeg Fire and Paramedic Service was called and police began resuscitation efforts until they arrived. Williams received treatment at Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg but died in the early morning of Jan. 12, 2019.

	Under The Fatality Inquiries Act, an inquest has been called by the chief medical examiner. Inquests explore the circumstances and events leading to deaths for the purpose of finding out what, if anything, might be done to prevent similar deaths in the future.

	Before the inquest begins, the judge will decide who can participate in the process and question witnesses.  Individuals and groups may make an application to be granted standing and participate in the inquest. Those interested in applying for standing should contact Jeannelle Allard, inquest counsel, at 204-726-6013 or jeannelle.allard@gov.mb.ca by June 5.

	The standing hearing will be held on June 17 at 2 p.m. in courtroom 408 at the Manitoba Law Courts Complex, 408 York Ave., Winnipeg.

Watch news conference





	The province is increasing infrastructure investments by an additional $500 million as part of an economic stimulus package to help restart Manitoba’s economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“As Manitoba continues to flatten the COVID curve, we are now in a position to slowly and carefully begin to restart our economy,” said Pallister. “Our government is committed to working with industry, municipalities and all levels of government to help stimulate our economy as we move forward through this global health and financial pandemic.”

	The $500-million investment through the Manitoba Restart Program announced today will expand on the significant already-planned infrastructure investments of $3 billion over the next two years, the premier noted.

	The Manitoba Restart Program will include new:
	•    water and sewage projects through the Municipal Water Services Board,
	•    road and highway resurfacing and repairs,
	•    bridge repairs,
	•    municipal infrastructure priorities, and
	•    potential new cost-sharing construction projects with other levels of government if agreements can be reached.

	“Today’s announcement builds on our commitment to ensure critical funding to Manitoba municipalities as promised in Budget 2020 remains intact, despite unprecedented financial pressures on the provincial government and record borrowing levels,” said Pallister. “Manitoba’s construction industry is ready to ramp up their work and we have many important shovel-worthy projects throughout the province to start that will improve the quality of life of all Manitobans.”

	The premier noted specific projects would start to be determined in the coming weeks.

	This additional investment is one of many measures undertaken by the province through the Manitoba Protection Program, which includes approximately $250 million in supports for small and medium-sized businesses and various measures to help the health and well-being of Manitobans.

PROVINCE SUPPORTING STUDENTS, POST-SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS WITH INCREASED BURSARY FUNDING
					  Dollar-for-Dollar Fund Matching will Strengthen Assistance in Time of Need: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The province is increasing its support for students and post-secondary institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing more matching funding for the Manitoba Scholarship and Bursary Initiative (MSBI) for the 2020-21 academic year, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	The province will match all funds raised by universities and colleges for the MSBI for the year, dollar for dollar, instead of with one dollar for every two dollars raised or donated privately.

	“As students and the post-secondary institutions they attend deal with challenges created by COVID-19, the Manitoba government is committed to providing the funding they need during these uncertain times,” said Pallister. “We are facing the obstacles in front of us together, and it is imperative that we rely on our strong partnership with post-secondary institutions and our shared vision for access to education.”

	By temporarily matching contributions from universities and colleges under the MSBI for 2020-21 with a 1:1 instead of a 1:2 ratio, the province will better ensure students receive financial supports amid fundraising challenges faced by post-secondary institutions due to the pandemic.

	As well, the province is committing $5 million to the MSBI program on top of the $10 million announced in Budget 2020, to maximize funds for students during the pandemic. With the 1:1 matching dollars, approximately $30 million will be provided to students this year through scholarships and bursaries.

	The MSBI is delivered by 12 participating post-secondary institutions and the Business Council of Manitoba, which undertake their own fundraising matched by provincial contributions. The MSBI has been highly successful, with a combined disbursement of approximately $23 million in private and public funds to 13,000 students in 2017-18, and with about $24 million to 14,700 students in 2018-19.

	The number of students who benefited from the MSBI in 2019-20 will be known this fall, and it is expected that the number will have increased, the premier noted.

	In addition, the separate Manitoba Bursary program, which provides up-front financial support to students in need, has been increased by $1.8 million for 2020-21 to put a total of $17.3 million into the hands of students when they need it as they begin their studies.

	The province has made significant enhancements to the Manitoba Bursary program since 2016-17. These changes have more than quadrupled the number of students in financial need who benefit. It is estimated that nearly 11,500 students will be supported under the Manitoba Bursary in 2019-20, the premier added.

	These measures further build on recently announced provincial supports for students including the $120-million Summer Student Recovery Plan – a $7-per-hour wage subsidy for employers to hire them – and a deferral of repayments of student loans to help those affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19. To date, more than 675 summer jobs for students have been supported through the new wage subsidy program.

	“Students are the future of our province and these improvements to the funding of bursaries will play a crucial role in Manitoba’s recovery from the pandemic,” said Pallister. “Students will have greater opportunities to help stimulate Manitoba’s economy and move the province forward.”

MANITOBA FISHING SEASON TO OFFICIALLY OPEN THIS WEEKEND


	The 2020-21 fishing season officially kicks off Saturday, May 9 in the Southern Division and Saturday, May 16 in the rest of the province, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“Recreational fishing is a great way to get outside, explore the outdoors and enjoy Manitoba’s wilderness,” said Pedersen. “Manitoba has an abundance of rivers and lakes that provide some of the world’s best fresh-water angling opportunities and can still be enjoyed by Manitobans in a safe, responsible manner while practising social distancing.”

	Due to late spring conditions, many fish will still be spawning during the start of the angling season. Anglers are asked to protect fish stocks by releasing fish who are discharging eggs back into the water. Manitobans are also reminded to exercise caution around flowing water and deteriorating ice conditions while enjoying Manitoba’s fishing opportunities.

	Manitobans are reminded that when outside, it is still important to practise social distancing according to current COVID-19 public health guidelines. For more information, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	The Manitoba government announced on April 9 the launch of its new, online service for the sale of outdoor licences and permits including angling licences. All anglers are required to obtain an angling licence to fish in Manitoba, unless exempt. Angling licences are now available online 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can be immediately purchased and printed at home. For more information and to purchase an angling licence, visit www.manitobaelicensing.ca.

	Anglers also need to be familiar with Manitoba's fishing regulations. On April 1, a new regulation came into force that states all walleye and sauger under 35 centimetres in length must be released from the Red River, Winnipeg River below the Pine Falls Dam, and Lake Winnipeg and its tributaries up to the first impassable barrier. This regulation will help support walleye and sauger populations in these fisheries. For more information on all provincial fishing regulations, refer to the 2020 Manitoba Anglers’ Guide at www.manitobafisheries.com.

	To prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) such as zebra mussels, surface water-users are reminded of the requirements when entering and exiting all water bodies in Manitoba. Additional decontamination and bait requirements are needed within AIS control zones. AIS requirements and set fines for offences are in effect year round. The AIS open-water season checklist is a step-by-step resource that can help surface water-users comply with the Manitoba government’s AIS regulations.

	The province will again be operating watercraft inspection stations to help watercraft users be compliant with AIS requirements. Anyone transporting a powerboat, canoe, Jet Ski or other type of watercraft over land, must stop at the inspection stations when they are open. The set fine for failing to stop at a watercraft inspection station is $672.

	After three years of monitoring Singush Lake, no evidence of the presence of zebra mussels has been found. As a result, the lake, located in Duck Mountain Provincial Park, will reopen for day-use boaters in 2020.

	For more information on AIS, Singush Lake or to access the open-water checklist, and location and hours of watercraft inspection stations, visit www.manitoba.ca/stopais.

PROVINCE INVESTING $45 MILLION FOR MANITOBA SENIORS TO LESSEN FINANCIAL BURDEN POSED BY COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  Seniors Throughout our Province Deserve our Help and Support: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The province is extending $45 million in direct financial support to Manitoba seniors during the COVID-19 pandemic through the new Seniors Economic Recovery Credit that will deliver a $200 tax credit to each recipient, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Senior citizens across the province are facing increased financial hardships because they now have to pay extra for grocery deliveries, or purchasing and learning to use technology at home so they can communicate with their family members and the loved ones they miss,” said Pallister. “Manitobans are working together to navigate this challenging time and seniors throughout our province deserve our help and support.”

	Created through an expansion of the Manitoba Protection Plan for the public health crisis, the Seniors Economic Recovery Credit will provide every Manitoban aged 65 and older with a one-time, refundable tax credit of $200. To ensure best use of the credit, the Department of Finance will proactively mail a payment cheque as a credit advance to each senior who filed a 2018 income tax return prior to April 1, 2020.

	Seniors who have changed mailing addresses since the time of their 2018 tax filings will have an opportunity to update the Department of Finance on their address changes through a government web portal at www.manitoba.ca/seniorseconomicrecoverycredit. Those who do not receive a cheque, have not updated their addresses or are new residents of Manitoba will be able to receive the $200 credit when they file their 2020 income tax return.

	Almost every senior across the province will receive the payment in May. The $200 credit will not be counted taxable as income and will not be used to claw back income-tested benefits to seniors, the premier noted.

	“As we slowly and carefully begin the process of reopening of our province’s economy, this credit is putting $45 million directly into the hands of Manitobans as we move forward from COVID-19,” said Pallister. “Manitoba seniors deserve assistance during this pandemic. We can’t relieve all of their stress during these difficult times, but we can make it more affordable for them.”

Backgrounder
Background Information


	To mark Canadian Mental Health Week, Premier Brian Pallister is encouraging Manitobans to access the various mental health supports available throughout the province, such as the internet-based therapy program AbilitiCBT. The province is providing this program, launched by Morneau Shepell, free of charge to help Manitobans cope with anxiety related to the many challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

	“Right now, many Manitobans are trying to balance some uniquely challenging aspects of this pandemic including uncertainty, isolation, grief, caring for family and community members, information overload and stress management,” said Pallister. “The AbilitiCBT program is there to offer help during this difficult time, I encourage Manitobans to continue signing up and start getting help.”

	AbilitiCBT is a cognitive behavioural therapy program that provides participants with 10 modules to complete at their own pace alongside trained professionals, while having access to live 24-hour crisis counsellors. The program focuses on helping individuals cope with feelings they are experiencing because of COVID19, while building the coping skills necessary to help deal with stress and anxiety in the future.

	Manitobans who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety can participate in the program free of charge, anytime and anywhere, by completing an online assessment. The program is available in both English and French to an unlimited number of Manitobans. To sign up for the program, visit www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/bewell/virtualtherapy.html.

	Health, Senior and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen noted the AbilitiCBT program complements the current crisis supports available by a number of Manitoba organizations during this pandemic.

	“Our government is working to improve mental health and addictions services throughout the province and this is another important tool in our emergency response to COVID-19,” Friesen said. “We are very proud of the partnerships we have with many trusted Manitoba organizations and are pleased to have invested over $25 million in mental health supports in recent months.”

	Organizations which have been funded through the government of Manitoba including the Klinic Crisis Line, the Manitoba Suicide Prevention and Support Line and others. Many of these programs are providing support to Manitobans during the pandemic including:
	•    the Klinic Mobile Withdrawal Management Services program, which is undertaking phone and in-person visits with clients seeking support to withdraw from alcohol or drugs;
	•    the NorWest Youth Hub has developed the Youth Quaranteen Support Line, in addition to counsellors and other working remotely and conducting telephone sessions with clients;
	•    trauma counselling programs at Klinic and the Laurel Centre, which are now being offered remotely; and
	•    Rapid Access to Addictions Medication (RAAM) clinics in Winnipeg, Selkirk, Thompson and Brandon, which are taking additional precautions to screen clients and continue to provide services.

	“Even as we practise physical distancing, there is a need for people to connect socially and have someone help navigate this challenging time,” said Pallister. “Many of the mental health and addictions programs we have supported in the last few months are doing important work to make sure Manitobans have access to the care and support they need,”

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO REDIRECT RESOURCES TO FRONT LINES WHILE MINIMIZING LAYOFFS
					  Necessary Savings Achieved to Mitigate Massive COVID-19 Impacts Through Creativity and Teamwork: Fielding


	Thanks to the efforts of numerous government departments, Crown corporations and more than 100 other outside reporting entities outside of the health-care sector, the Manitoba government will have the financial capacity to continue increased spending to support critical front-line services in the ongoing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“Ensuring public health and safety during the global COVID-19 pandemic has meant redirecting resources to the front lines, and making crucial and sustained investments to protect all Manitobans,” said Fielding. “At the same time the economic impacts of COVID-19 are unprecedented, causing a massive level of private-sector layoffs and the rapid deterioration of all provincial finances through a combination of rising expenses and collapsing revenues.”

	Overall, the size of government is still expected to grow by more than $1 billion this year. However, through these efforts by non-front-line care government departments and other public-sector organizations, 4.9 per cent of non-essential operating expenses and 2.2 per cent of non-essential workforce expenditures will be redirected to the front-line COVID response. 

	“Our aim has always been to minimize temporary public-sector layoffs, despite the tremendous fiscal challenges we’re facing,” said Fielding. “And through our success in finding other necessary operating savings in non-essential discretionary spending areas, we will have kept our actual workforce expense reductions to just over two per cent, many of which have already been implemented.”

	The province is now projecting a deficit up to $5 billion in 2020-21, caused by a drop in provincial revenues of approximately $3 billion and additional COVID-19 related costs of approximately$2 billion. The cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) alone could reach up to $1 billion, the minister highlighted, and the province has committed more than $250 million to support struggling businesses with more support programs to be announced in the coming weeks.

	External rating agencies continue to report that Manitoba has the highest direct-debt-to-revenue ratio among provinces, estimated at 297 per cent, and the highest direct debt per capita. These same agencies have reported that, due to this high debt load, Manitoba is among the most vulnerable of all provinces to withstand economic shocks such as the global COVID-19 pandemic.

	“We will continue to responsibly address our profound challenges. In order to procure PPE and support the rapidly escalating costs of our ongoing front-line response to the pandemic and mounting pressures on other areas of government, we have to focus our spending and spend smarter,” said Fielding. “We’ve taken an all-hands-on-deck approach, working together with management, public-sector unions and our front-line workers within government departments and our outside reporting entities, to find creative ways to redirect resources to where they’re needed most and innovative ways to adjust our service delivery models given the new realities caused by COVID-19.”

	The minister cited numerous examples of successful teamwork and innovation since March:
	•    the repurposing of Crown corporation facilities for front-line support,
	•    the redeployment of hundreds of staff across government and Crown corporations to priority areas such as the Manitoba Emergency Co-ordination Centre and centralized pandemic procurement and distribution logistics within the health system,
	•    the redeployment of Shared Health employees to Cadham Labs to support increased testing capacity, and
	•    the creation of inter-disciplinary teams to address the urgent priority of supporting front-line health-care workers with child-care opportunities and rapidly rolling out new support programs for Manitobans.

	The minister also reinforced the work of government and outside reporting entities to minimize layoffs continues and that government would pursue all alternative tools, such as voluntary reduced workweeks and possible work sharing options, to achieve the necessary reduction in workforce expenses.

PROVINCE ENCOURAGES MANITOBANS TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO MINIMIZE RISK OF TICK EXPOSURE


	May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month and as the weather warms up, Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living reminds Manitobans that tick-borne diseases are preventable. People can protect themselves by performing regular tick checks after spending time outdoors, knowing where blacklegged ticks may be found, minimizing their risk of exposure and recognizing the signs and symptoms of tick-borne diseases. These precautions will help protect against anaplasmosis, babesiosis and Lyme disease.

	Manitobans are reminded that when outside, it is still important to practice social distancing according to current COVID-19 public health guidelines. For more information, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Blacklegged ticks, which can carry anaplasmosis, babesiosis and Lyme disease, are most commonly found within and along the edge of forests and in areas with thick, woody shrubs and other vegetation. These ticks are typically found from early spring when snow melts through late fall. 

	The province continues to monitor and assess the continued expansion of blacklegged tick populations. Members of the public can assist with surveillance by submitting images of collected ticks to the ticks@gov.mb.ca email. Maps of areas with known blacklegged tick populations, where the risk of tick-borne disease transmission is greatest, can be found at: www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/tickborne/surveillance.html.

	The burden of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in Manitoba continues to increase, and the 2019 season was the most active to date with 64 confirmed and probable Lyme disease cases reported. Since 2015, nearly 90 per cent of anaplasmosis and Lyme disease cases reported in Manitoba had likely local exposure. Most anaplasmosis and Lyme disease cases were exposed between May and July, and less than 40 per cent recalled a tick bite. This low recall likely reflects exposure to smaller blacklegged tick nymphs, whose activity also peaks between May and July.

	Limiting exposure to potentially infected blacklegged ticks, particularly the smaller nymphs who are active during the late spring and summer months, is the key to tick-borne disease prevention. Manitobans are encouraged to take precautions to minimize their risk of tick exposure by:
	•    applying an appropriate tick repellent, following label directions, on exposed skin and clothing;
	•    inspecting themselves, children and pets after spending time outdoors;
	•    removing ticks as soon as possible from people and pets; 
	•    staying to the centre of walking trails;
	•    wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts; and
	•    keeping grass and shrubs around homes cut short to create drier environments that are less suitable for blacklegged tick survival.

	To learn more about blacklegged ticks, tick-disease, symptoms and prevention visit:
www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/tickborne/index.html.

	People who think they may have anaplasmosis, babesiosis or Lyme disease should contact a doctor. For more information, they may also contact Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) 1 888 315-9257.

PROVINCE EXPANDS ACCESS TO SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING FOR GRADE 9 TO 12 STUDENTS IN MANITOBA
					  Expansion of InformNet Summer School Provides Additional Supports for Students Across Manitoba: Goertzen


	The province is expanding its partnership with InformNet to increase access to summer school programming for grade 9 to 12 students in Manitoba, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	“The expansion of InformNet summer school will provide additional supports for students across Manitoba during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Goertzen. “This will help students to be as prepared as possible for the next school year.”

	InformNet is an online high school learning management system operated by the Pembina Trails and St. James-Assiniboia school divisions.
	 
	Student fees for summer school courses will be waived for 2020 and there will be no cap on enrolment. InformNet summer school is available for grade 9 to 12 students who have not successfully completed a course(s) during the regular academic year or wish to improve their grade(s). Summer courses follow the provincial guideline of 45 hours of curriculum content. A certified teacher with experience and expertise in the subject area facilitates all online courses. In addition, French language and print-based strategies are under development.

	InformNet summer school runs from July 3 to 29. Registration begins today. Students can register for summer school courses at www.informnet.mb.ca/.  

	“The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we do many things in Manitoba, including suspension of classroom-based education, but learning must continue,” said Goertzen. “Earlier this month we announced the web portal, My Learning at Home/Mon Apprentissage Chez Moi, a comprehensive online resource to supplement learning and help teachers, families and caregivers support students. Expanding access to InformNet summer school is one more way we are helping our students succeed.”

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT MAINTAINING FUNDING FOR MUNICIPALITIES
					  Provide Certainty to Local Governments to Help Maintain Critical Essential Services to Their Citizens: Pallister


	The province will ensure critical funding to Manitoba municipalities remains intact during the unprecedented economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“As Manitobans, we are all facing tough times and I want to make one thing very clear – we are committed to maintaining our funding to municipalities as promised in Budget 2020,” said Pallister. “This is in spite of unprecedented financial pressure on the provincial government, but we want to provide certainty to municipalities to help maintain critical essential services such as emergency personnel.”

	The province provides a total of $172.6 million in operating funding to municipalities as well a total of $137 million in municipal infrastructure funding.

	Following Wednesday’s release of Restoring Safe Services: Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap to Recovery, the premier hosted a series of socially distanced meetings and tele-conferences to discuss the front-line fight against the pandemic with municipal leaders from across Manitoba.  

	“Manitobans are resilient and it is heartwarming to witness the way our communities band together in times of crisis,” said Pallister. “We will beat this pandemic together and will come out stronger for it.”

	Full details on the plan are available at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices and businesses with questions on restoring their services should visit https://engagemb.ca/.

	Maintaining critical funding to municipalities is one of the ways the provincial government continues to directly support Manitoba communities. In March, the province announced nearly $8 million in one-time funding for spring flood preparedness projects in 83 municipalities.

	Manitoba has invested more than $900 million under the Manitoba Protection Plan in the fight against COVID-19. In addition, the province has announced a number of measures in order to provide financial relief for Manitobans including:
	•    Ensuring up to $110 million is returned to Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) policyholders. Rebates are expected to be around 11 per cent, or between $140 to $160 per average policyholder.
	•    Providing up to $120 million to support Manitoba’s small and medium-sized businesses through the Manitoba Gap Protection Program (MGPP). The province will advance each eligible business the non-interest bearing forgivable MGPP loan of $6,000, for a total of up to $120 million.
	•    Returning the $37-million Workers Compensation Board (WCB) surplus to eligible Manitoba employers. This month, eligible employers will receive a credit to their account based on 20 per cent of their 2019 premium. WCB expects $29 million will be returned to the private sector, with approximately $7 million going to small businesses in Manitoba.

MANITOBA LEGISLATURE TO RESUME ON LIMITED BASIS WHILE FOLLOWING PUBLIC HEALTH REQUIREMENTS FOR COVID-19


	The Manitoba legislature will reconvene on Wednesday, May 6, to resume the legislative session on a limited schedule after it had been adjourned March 19 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, government house leader Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	“As Manitoba gradually begins to reopen next week, our government will do the same to resume the second session of the province’s 42nd legislature,” said Goertzen. “Physical distancing measures will be in place in the legislative chamber, and all members of the legislative assembly will be required to comply with all relevant public health directives in place at that time.”

	One sitting day will be held each week throughout May, on the 6th, 13th, 20th and 27th of the month. These sittings will proceed on a schedule as they would normally, with a question period at 1:30 p.m. and debate on government business in the afternoon.

	A reduced number of members will be in the chamber to participate at any given time, in accordance with public health requirements as ordered by Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. Some logistical details continue to be worked out including the form that virtual legislative sittings might take with members possibly participating through video and/or audio links. A potential virtual sitting option is being led by the office of the Speaker of the assembly.

	“We recognize it is important to allow the opposition to fulfil its role regarding its questions of the government, as well as to protect the health of all members by limiting large gatherings,” said Goertzen.

	In addition to regular sittings in the chamber, meetings of the Standing Committee on Crown Corporations will be scheduled for May 28, June 4 and June 11. Discussions are also proceeding toward scheduling a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee.

PROVINCE TO HOLD PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON PARAMEDIC SELF-REGULATION AMENDMENTS


	The Manitoba government is holding public consultations to support legislative changes that would transition paramedics and emergency medical responders to self-regulation under The Regulated Health Professions Act, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.  

	“Our government committed in 2016 to establish paramedicine as a self-regulated health profession to improve the quality of care provided to Manitobans,” said Friesen. “The move to self regulation will also support the professional growth of paramedics and increase transparency in the regulation of the profession. I encourage the public to take part in this consultation.”

	The amendments to the regulation would transition paramedics and emergency medical responders to work under regulations outlined by the College of Paramedics of Manitoba, and would set out the categories of procedures that members of the profession are authorized to perform.

	Currently, paramedicine is not a self-regulating profession like other health professions. Instead, paramedics and emergency medical responders are licensed by Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) under The Emergency Medical Response and Stretcher Transportation Act. The Practice of Paramedicine Regulation was enacted on June 1, 2018, to:  
	•    designate the profession of paramedicine as a regulated health profession,
	•    establish the College of Paramedics of Manitoba, and
	•    set out the scope of practice of the profession.

	In addition, the Council of the College of Paramedics is seeking public feedback on a proposed College of Paramedics of Manitoba General Regulation.

	“We are appreciative of the opportunity for the public consultation to commence. We value the opinion of the public, paramedics, and other stakeholders related to the proposed regulation,” said Trish Bergal, executive director/registrar, College of Paramedics of Manitoba. “This is an important step to becoming a self-regulated profession in Manitoba.”

	This regulation defines who is able to register with the college and practice as a paramedic or an emergency medical responder, defines what type of health-care procedures paramedics can perform and the terms and conditions on the performance of those procedures, and sets out standards of practice for the profession and continuing competency requirements.

	Due to COVID-19 and restrictions under current public health orders, the public is encouraged to review the proposed amendments and provide feedback online until June 29.

	The data also shows:
	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized, with no individuals in intensive care;
	•    38 active cases and 235 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.

	As of yesterday, an additional 689 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 25,402.

	Public health orders restricting staff from working in more than one licensed personal care home (PCH) have been signed and will take effect today. The single-site restriction is intended to provide additional protection against the introduction and/or spread of the COVID-19 virus within PCHs.

	In recognition of the vulnerability of the PCH population to severe illness and/or death related to the virus, provincial planning has been underway to ensure the change is able to be implemented quickly while ensuring stable staffing and service continuity. As of today, all of Manitoba’s 127 licensed PCHs have confirmed readiness, with staff in place.

	It is important to note that while some gradual lifting of restrictions has begun, significant work to limit the spread of COVID-19 must continue. Public health officials are also advising people to remain within or close to their home communities. The request to stay home as much as possible is still in place at this time. This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba and neighbouring jurisdictions, to essential trips only.

	The province is also launching an education campaign on being ‘COVID careful’ in cottage country to remind all campers and cottagers that COVID-19 guidelines must be followed. The goal is to raise awareness and encourage Manitobans to do the same within their social networks by posting supportive educational messages.

	The campaign will include portable signs and education stops on key highway routes, new materials that can be displayed in car and cottage windows, as well as a social media campaign, all designed to show that cottagers in provincial parks and across the province are aware of their responsibilities and are encouraging others to stay mindful.

	A secure online portal is being established to allow Manitobans who have been tested for COVID-19 to more quickly access their negative test results. Starting next week, when people are tested they will receive information about how to register and access these results. Users will need a Manitoba health registration card in order to access their results online.

	A toll-free number will be available early next week to provide results to those without a Manitoba health card or those without internet access. As always, public health officials will directly notify Manitobans who have tested positive for COVID-19.

	A new drive-thru community testing site opened today in Swan River, at the Manitoba Public Insurance facility, 125 Fourth Ave. North. Hours of operation are daily from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. This is Manitoba’s 16th community testing site and ninth drive-thru location.

	Additionally, work is underway to get a new testing site established at Thunderbird House to support access to testing for Winnipeg’s homeless and shelter populations, as well as a new mobile service available in the next two weeks to serve clients with limited mobility.

PROVINCE OPENS ONLINE INTAKE FOR $120-MILLION MANITOBA GAP PROTECTION PROGRAM
					  Businesses Impacted by COVID-19 Encouraged to Apply to Receive $6,000: Pallister


	The provincial government’s online portal to facilitate business applications to the Manitoba Gap Protection Program (MGPP) is now live, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Many Manitoba small and medium-sized businesses are facing significant pressures brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we want to help them through this challenging time,” said Pallister. “We created a Manitoba solution to bridge the gap for approximately 20,000 businesses that don’t qualify for the federal funding announced in response to COVID-19, to make sure some relief is available to local businesses so they can minimize layoffs, hire staff back and prepare to safely restore the services they offer to Manitobans.”

	The premier announced the $120-million MGPP last week and noted staff worked hard to get a website up and running so Manitoba businesses can submit applications for funding. The MGPP provides an interest-free, forgivable $6,000 loan to small and medium-sized businesses in Manitoba that have experienced hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health orders. Loans are available to businesses that fail to qualify for the various federal government assistance programs and wage subsidies created because of COVID-19.

	Eligible businesses will receive a one-time, lump-sum payment of $6,000, electronically deposited into their business bank account.

	“Our government has been working with Manitoba’s business sector to identify the greatest need and target our support to businesses harmed by the pandemic and its fallout,” said Pallister. “We are working with our partners to ensure we make the right decisions at the right time so we can provide maximum opportunities for recovery for the benefit of all Manitobans.”

	Permanent, Manitoba-based businesses that were operational in the province on March 20 (the date the Manitoba government declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19) are eligible to apply if they temporarily ceased or curtailed operations as a result of a COVID-19 public health order, which harmed their business in Manitoba. Businesses must not have received federal government COVID-19 grant funding support, and do not intend to apply for and receive previously announced federal government COVID-19 non-repayable funding support.

	Eligible businesses are now able to submit online applications forms at https://manitoba.ca/covid19/business/mgpp.html. To apply online, applicants must have:
	•    a valid Manitoba Business Number;
	•    a Companies Office registry number;
	•    good standing with the Companies Office;
	•    Manitoba Workers Compensation Board and Manitoba Retail Sales Tax account numbers, if applicable;
	•    the sole proprietor’s social insurance number (SIN) as well as one other partner’s SIN (if the business is a partnership);
	•    business email address; and
	•    business bank account information for purposes of depositing the payment.

	The full form and list of eligibility criteria is available online. Individuals that require assistance in completing the online form can contact the Manitoba Economic Support Centre (toll-free) at 1-888-805-7554.
	 
	The province’s goal is to provide a $6,000 deposit to eligible businesses within a few days of applying online, the premier added.

	The application deadline for MGPP is July 31.

	Reservations for Manitoba campgrounds open next week and staggered dates will be offered to make it easier for outdoor enthusiasts to book a site at their favourite campground, Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard announced today.

	“We thank Manitobans for their commitment in acting on the advice our health-care experts to stay home for the benefits of themselves, their loved ones and their community,” said Guillemard. “It is through their dedication and actions that we are able to allow Manitobans to continue to visit our provincial parks, and we are pleased to open up our campgrounds for the season, with additional safety measures in place. I believe this is welcome news for many Manitobans and their families.

	“I encourage everyone to keep practicing the fundamentals of good hygiene and social distancing while at home, and especially while enjoying some quality time outside with their loved ones, whether camping, at the cottage and throughout our beautiful parks.”

	Manitobans are reminded to take advantage of the new opportunity to buy a park vehicle pass online as part of the province’s new e-licensing program that launched earlier this year.

	To accommodate the expected high demand on the opening day of the parks reservation system, online and call centre services will begin at 7 a.m. at http://prs.gov.mb.ca, 204-948-3333 (in Winnipeg) or 1 888-482-2267 (toll free). Check the website for call centre hours on other days. Customers making online reservations are advised to check their user IDs and passwords prior to May 4.

MANITOBA RECOGNIZES WEEK OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR
					  Child-Care Providers are Heroes Helping Heroes: Stefanson


	The Manitoba government is recognizing the incredible work of child-care providers throughout the year and as heroes helping heroes during the province’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today to mark the Week of the Early Childhood Educator.

	 

	“The Week of the Early Childhood Educator is even more significant this year, as the care, compassion and commitment of Manitoba’s child-care sector has been on display throughout our response to the pandemic,” said Stefanson. “On behalf of all families, I would like to thank the heroes in child care who are helping our heroes on the front lines and those who are providing essential services. This week is also a time for us to recognize the incredible dedication early childhood educators, child-care assistants, and licensed home-based providers show every day in providing quality early learning and child-care services for Manitoba’s children and families.”

	 

	Manitoba has declared April 26 to May 2 as the Week of the Early Childhood Educator, an annual event recognizing and celebrating their many contributions to children, families, the community and the provincial economy.

	 

	“During these unprecedented times, the proclamation by the minister of families for the Week of the Early Childhood Educator is particularly meaningful,” said Jodie Kehl, executive director, Manitoba Child Care Association (MCCA). “MCCA acknowledges and thanks all our members for their commitment and professionalism. The early learning and child-care sector continues to demonstrate their dedication in supporting Manitoba’s children and families.”

	 

	The minister applauds early childhood educators and child-care providers that have chosen to remain open to serve families during the COVID-19 pandemic response.Families seeking care can visit the province’s online portal at https://eswchildcare.ca/to find an open child-care centre that meets their needs.

	 

	To provide ongoing support to all licensed child-care facilities in Manitoba, full provincial operating grants totalling more than $30 million were provided on April 1. Child-care providers are encouraged to reopen at a reduced capacity of 16 children for child-care centres and eight children for home-based providers. All child-care providers can contact cdcinfo@gov.mb.caor call Manitoba Government Inquiry at 204-945-3744 or (toll-free) 1-866-MANITOBA (1-866-626-4862) to be included in the online portal.

PROVINCE IMPLEMENTING WILDFIRE PREVENTION MEASURES
					  Protecting Front-Line Staff from Exposure to COVID-19


	Manitoba Climate and Conservation advises the current risk of wildfire is generally low across the province, with a significant amount of snow still on the ground in northern Manitoba. Human-caused wildfires, primarily grass fires, have been reported in the south. In order to reduce the risk of fire and the risk of exposure to COVID-19 for front-line firefighters, the province is asking the public to be particularly cautious when outdoors to prevent human-caused wildfires. Protecting front-line firefighters and support staff during the COVID-19 pandemic is a top priority to ensure they remain healthy and available to respond to wildfires during the upcoming season.

	In light of current events and as a wildfire prevention measure, provincial burn permits issued under The Wildfires Act within the burning permit area will be limited to only essential crop residue burning and other required agricultural, municipal or industrial operations. Burning within the burning permit area requires the approval of an officer and may include a site inspection. Contact a Manitoba Conservation and Climate office for more information. The latest information on municipal and provincial burn restrictions can be found at www.manitoba.ca/wildfire.

	All applicable provincial and municipal burning approval processes must be followed before burning. Provincial burn permit holders must comply with Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development’s guidance on crop residue burning and their municipality’s burning permit conditions, where applicable. Daily guidance for crop residue burning will be posted by 11 a.m. at www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/crop-residue-burning-program/index.html.

	Where there is a conflict, consult with a local Manitoba Conservation and Climate office or municipal authority for clarification. Provincial burn permits will not be issued for areas where municipalities have already implemented burning restrictions. 

	Burn permit holders are reminded to check weather conditions, have adequate suppression equipment and ensure proper fuel breaks are in place before burning. Never leave an outdoor fire unattended and always extinguish it before leaving. 

	Anyone using an ATV should stay on developed trails, stop frequently to check areas around the engine and exhaust for debris, and carefully dispose of any debris caught in equipment. A small shovel, axe, and fire extinguisher should be carried on ATVs at all times. 

	To report a wildfire, call 911 or the T.I.P. line (toll-free) at 1-800-782-0076.

Watch news conference





	Public health officials advise two new cases of COVID-19 have been identified as of 9:30 a.m. today, bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 275.

	The data also shows:
	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized, with no individuals in intensive care;
	•    49 active cases and 220 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.

	As of yesterday, an additional 424 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 24,723.

	Public Health orders restricting staff from working in more than one licensed personal care home (PCH) have been signed and will take effect May 1. The single-site restriction is intended to provide additional protection against the introduction and/or spread of the COVID-19 virus within PCHs.

	In recognition of the vulnerability of the PCH population to severe illness and/or death related to the virus, provincial planning has been underway to ensure the change is able to be implemented quickly while ensuring stable staffing and service continuity. Of the 127 licensed PCHs in Manitoba, 121 have confirmed readiness, with work ongoing to address staffing issues at the remaining sites by the weekend.

	It is important to note that while some gradual lifting or restrictions has begun, significant work to limit the spread of COVID-19 must continue. Public health is also advising people to remain within or close to their home communities. The request to stay home as much as possible is still in place at this time. This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only. Visits to cottages are not recommended at this time. Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

	A new drive-thru community testing site will open Friday in Swan River, at the Manitoba Public Insurance facility, 125 Fourth Ave. North. Hours of operation will be daily from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. This is Manitoba’s 16th community testing site and ninth drive-thru location.

	For up-to-date information on testing criteria and community screening sites, visit www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html. For more information and to access the online screening tool for COVID-19, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

MANITOBA PARTNERS WITH TELUS TO KEEP CHILDREN IN CARE CONNECTED WITH FAMILY, SCHOOL SUPPORTS


Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government applauds TELUS for donating tablets and data plans to help ensure children coming into care can stay connected with family members and other important supports during the COVID-19 pandemic, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“Re-establishing a connection with safe and trusted family members is incredibly important for children who must come into care, and this has become an even greater challenge as we are all social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19,” said Stefanson. “Through our partnership with TELUS, children will be able to text or video chat with family and other loved ones, stay on top of school assignments and remain connected. Together, we are supporting vulnerable youth so they can continue to feel connected to family members, elders and siblings during this difficult time.”

	TELUS has donated more than 120 tablets with data plans to the province. The majority will go to emergency placement shelters operated by Winnipeg Child and Family Services (CFS), which are used until arrangements that are more permanent can be made for children coming into care and to provide a safe place for youth who may be in safe havens or group care settings. Some of the tablets will go to small operators who provide services to at-risk youth. The tablets will help children to quickly reconnect with family members, friends, teachers and other supports, creating stability during this challenging time, the minister noted.

	“TELUS is deeply committed to keeping Manitobans safe and connected during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the province’s most at-risk and vulnerable citizens,” said Tim Prokipchuk, director of sales, TELUS. “This public health crisis has reminded us all of the importance of human connection, and it is a privilege for our team to be able to provide access to the devices and service needed for children to stay in touch with loved ones, educators and vital support services.”

	Eighty-five tablets will be used by Winnipeg CFS. The remaining tablets will be distributed to community partners that also provide emergency as well as longer-term placements and supports for vulnerable children from across the province including:
	•    Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre (11 tablets);
	•    Neecheewam (seven);
	•    Ndinawemaaganag Endaawaad (six);
	•    Blue Thunderbird Family Care (five);
	•    Roots Youth Care (four);
	•    Reach Youth Services (three); and
	•    Jessie Home (two).

	“These are indeed trying times, especially for children and youth in care,” said Karl Gompf, acting executive director, Jessie Home. “The TELUS donation is coming at a crucial time and is like a breath of fresh air. Keeping in touch with family and friends and enhanced contact with teachers is so essential for the positive mental health of our young people. From the staff and residents, virtual hugs.”

	The minister noted this partnership builds on the Manitoba Protection Plan, a series of government-wide initiatives to support Manitobans through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Watch news conference





	Public health officials advise one new case of COVID-19 has been identified as of 9:30 a.m. today, bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 273.

	The data also shows:
	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized, with no individuals in intensive care;
	•    54 active cases and 213 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.

	As of yesterday, an additional 448 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 24,304.

	Today, health officials released information about the models developed in Manitoba to inform the management plan for the COVID-19 pandemic in Manitoba. A model for the spread of COVID-19 was created, using data and information available in the scientific literature from other jurisdictions and with input from experts in Manitoba.  
	 
	Officials noted that modelling results are always an abstraction and cannot project all possible outcomes. Outbreaks also evolve and change over time as public health measures are put in place and people’s behaviour changes. Therefore, these projections must be constantly revised. As new information is received, officials will continue to refine the projections, models and health advice for Manitobans.
	 
	Current models show that:
	•    under routine public health measures, which include case interviews and contact tracing but which do not include social and physical distancing or travel restrictions, modeling suggests Manitoba would have had 933 cases by April 25. If that trend had continued, there would have been more than 2,000 cases by mid-May. However, the number of cases on April 25 was 267.
	•    under current public health measures, Manitoba could expect approximately 6,250 cases if the current measures remain in place for a year.
	•    the Manitoba health-care system has 2,432 acute care medical and surgical hospital beds. As of April 26, 977 of these beds were currently vacant and available for COVID-19 patients, a 40 per cent vacancy rate. This shows Manitoba is well within hospital capacity at this time.
	•    the Manitoba health-care system has 86 adult intensive care hospital beds. As of April 22, 29 of these beds were vacant and available for COVID-19 patients, a 34 per cent vacancy rate. This shows Manitoba is well within intensive care capacity at this time.
	 
	This data supports the easing of public health measures, as announced earlier today. Officials also noted that planning is underway to add an additional 300 beds and an additional 100 intensive care beds for COVID-19 patients, if needed. Additional capacity options are being investigated if they are necessary.

PREMIER UNVEILS MANITOBA'S ROADMAP TO EXPANDING SERVICES SAFELY
					  Manitoba to Begin Easing Restrictions on Businesses; Physical Distancing Measures Still in Effect: Premier

Watch news conference





	Manitoba will begin a careful, multi-phased effort next week to gradually restore services, open some businesses and increase recreational opportunities while maintaining social distancing advice, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“We applaud Manitobans for doing their part to help flatten the curve and it is thanks to everyone’s tremendous efforts that we are able to announce today a gradual, safe restoration of services and easing of restrictions on businesses, allowing many to reopen, should they so choose,” Pallister said. “We must remain diligent in maintaining physical distancing and practising good hygiene, but our gradual, leveled approach will help us safely restore our services.”

	As of May 4, a variety of non-essential health-care and retail businesses will have the option to reopen under strict guidelines. All businesses and venues will be required to continue following social distancing and stringent cleaning practices to protect both employees and customers.

	Size restrictions of public and private gatherings of no more than 10 people will remain in place. Everyone is expected to continue to follow social distancing rules at all times and to stay home if they are sick. Travel restrictions will remain in place such as avoiding all non-essential travel outside of Manitoba, and requirements for self-isolation for 14 days following travel will continue.

	Based on the evolving global public health recommendations and modelling, Manitoba is in a position to begin a methodical, phased-in approach to reopening businesses, said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.

	“Our public health measures to date have helped us reduce case numbers and flatten the curve, but it is not practical to maintain these measures indefinitely,” said Roussin. “That is why we will gradually reduce these measures including balancing the need to protect vulnerable Manitobans from COVID-19 with the need to protect Manitobans from the unintended impacts of strict public health measures, which include health and social impacts.”

Phased Approach to Restoring Services

Restoring Safe Services:  Manitoba’s Pandemic Economic Recovery Roadmap consists of multiple phases. It is critical to note the timing and specifics noted in each phase are subject to change, based on the advice of public health experts and a continuous assessment of transmission patterns and other factors.

	Full details are available at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices.

Restoring Services (Phase One) – Beginning May 4

	Critical public health measures and travel restrictions remain. Priority elective surgeries have been restarted, diagnostics screening will resume and some non-essential businesses will reopen but must limit occupancy to 50 per cent of normal business levels or one person per 10 square metres, whichever is lower. Services, businesses and venues include:
	•    non-urgent surgery and diagnostic procedures;
	•    therapeutic and medical services;
	•    retail businesses;
	•    restaurants – patio/walk-up services;
	•    hair salons;
	•    museums, galleries and libraries;
	•    seasonal day camps; and
	•    outdoor recreation and campgrounds.

	The province will continually re-evaluate and adjust plans for further easing of secondary public health measures and may reintroduce others.

Restoring Services (Phase Two) – No Earlier Than June 1

	Critical public health measures and travel restrictions may remain in place. Public gathering sizes may be increased and more non-essential businesses will be considered for reopening including:
	•    additional personal services, such as nail salons;
	•    restaurants – dine-in services;
	•    non-contact children’s sports; and
	•    film production.

Future Phases

	Public health measures may be eased further. Additional guidelines will be developed, public gathering sizes will be increased and some non-essential business will fully open. Others may begin to reopen, such as bars, pools and spas, movie theatres and indoor recreational facilities. Travel restrictions may be eased.

	Specific considerations for other businesses and sectors may be made including:
	•    performing arts venues;
	•    other non-essential businesses;
	•    tattoo parlours, estheticians, cosmetologists and tanning studios; and
	•    large gatherings/events.

	Mass gatherings such as concerts, summer festivals and major sporting events will not be considered before September 2020, Roussin noted.

	Child care plays an important role in restoring services, enabling parents to return to the workplace, and remains a priority. The Department of Families will continue to work with the child-care community to expand the temporary child-care services available, including a grant available to child-care providers seeking to open a new, home-based child-care service.

	More information on child-care services during COVID-19, including a self-serve child care website, can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/infomanitobans/childcare.html.

PROVINCE IMPLEMENTS NEW TEMPORARY ORDERS UNDER THE EMERGENCY MEASURES ACT
					  Orders Support Manitobans' Well-being and Livelihoods: Pallister


	The Manitoba government is implementing four new temporary orders under The Emergency Measures Act to protect vulnerable Manitobans, to help the economy, and to ensure the flow of goods and supplies into and out of Manitoba, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“The health and safety of all Manitobans, especially those most vulnerable, is our number one priority as we fight COVID-19 and navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic,” said Pallister. “Our government is listening and acting on the concerns brought forward by our partners in various areas, such as social services, post-secondary education and the transportation industry. We are suspending certain statutory requirements and extending deadlines with the well-being of Manitobans in mind.”

	The province is implementing four orders, retroactive to the beginning of the state of emergency March 20:
	•    Youth in Care Provisions Order,
	•    Student Aid Provisions Order,
	•    International Fuel Tax Agreement Credential Provisions Order, and
	•    Trucking and Transportation Provisions Order.

	“We’re making responsible, common sense adjustments because it’s the right thing to do in this time of crisis,” said Pallister. “Youth in the care of Manitoba Child and Family Services (CFS) will continue to be supported, even if they age out of the system during this state of emergency. Post-secondary students and graduates won’t have to stress about losing eligibility for student aid or repaying loans during this time.

	“We’re also taking steps to extend permits and to safely reduce some regulatory requirements for truck drivers and commercial vehicle operators to ensure they can stay on the road and continue the movement of essential goods and supplies.”

	Under the Youth in Care Provisions Order, youth in the CFS system who turn 18 during this period must continue to be offered ongoing supports. This extension also applies to young adults who have chosen to sign a voluntary agreement to continue to receive assistance as they transition to independence, which would allow them to remain eligible beyond age 21.   

	The Student Aid Provisions Order allows post-secondary students to remain eligible for aid, even if they temporarily stop qualifying during the state of emergency period. The provision lowers the minimum monthly repayment to $0 from $25, suspends the obligation for a student to start paying back their loan eight months after they end their studies, prevents borrowers from going into default during the state of emergency period and extends the maximum term for repayment. Those with existing loans are not obligated to pay back their loan for six months beginning March 30.

	The International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) Credential Provisions Order suspends the requirement that a carrier licensed under the agreement must have and display credentials, and the province will not fine licensed carriers if their licensing authority was unable to distribute their credentials.

	The province previously provided relief to carriers who do not have an IFTA licence in The Fuel Tax Amendment and Retail Sales Tax Amendment Act. The requirement to obtain a single-trip permit for each truck entering Manitoba was suspended for the duration of the state of emergency.

	The Trucking and Transportation Provisions Order is extending the expiry dates on certain permits, certificates or registrations until July 31. This includes qualifying vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan (IRP), the vehicle registration system for trucks and buses operating inter-jurisdictionally between Manitoba and other provinces or states throughout North America. Deadlines to pay IRP registration renewal charges are also extended. The order also extends the period between required inspections on vehicles such as buses and commercial carriers, extends annual overweight or over-dimensional vehicle permits, and extends safety fitness certificates for commercial carriers. The order will also provide a temporary exemption from the need for single-trip permits for increased vehicle weights and for commercial vehicles from other jurisdictions.

	The regular three-month deadline for new residents and non-residents to replace their out-of-province driving permits with a Manitoba driver’s licence, vehicle registration or insurance is also extended to July 31 (or three months after they enter the province, whichever time period is longer).

	The province has the ability to revoke any of the above orders sooner than stated above if it deems necessary.

PROVINCE INCREASES COVID-19 TESTING CRITERIA AND CAPACITY
					  A Crucial Step in the Process to Restart the Economy:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	The province is expanding COVID-19 testing criteria while also ramping up its testing capacity, a crucial step before beginning to loosen public health measures and safely restarting Manitoba’s economy, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Through good planning, Manitoba has been able to get ahead of COVID-19 and flatten the curve,” said Pallister. “We want to stay ahead of this virus and not chase it. With increased levels of tracking, testing and isolation, we will have a better understanding of how we are doing as a province in flattening the COVID curve. This is crucial as we carefully and slowly work toward expanding services safely in the coming weeks and months.”

	Effective immediately, the province is expanding testing criteria to any Manitoban with symptoms of COVID-19, even mild symptoms including a cough, runny nose, sore throat and/or fever, to be tested to better determine the spread of the virus in Manitoba, the premier noted.

	In order to facilitate enhanced testing provincewide, Dynacare will begin significantly increasing COVID-19 testing alongside Manitoba’s primary public health lab, Cadham Provincial Lab (CPL).

	Dynacare has been performing COVID-19 tests since early April out of its Ontario-based laboratory to supplement the capacity of CPL and, as of April 27, has completed 557 tests. The Manitoba government and Dynacare have entered into a partnership that will see up to 2,000 tests a day before the end of summer.

	With CPL’s capacity at over 1,000 tests daily, the province expects to have testing capacity of well over 3,000 tests a day, tripling the provinces current testing capacity, the premier noted. In addition, Dynacare will work toward establishing a second COVID testing lab in Winnipeg, assisting the province with faster processing times.

	Shared Health’s diagnostic services is also supporting the province’s enhanced testing capacity, performing some COVID-19 testing for patients at HSC Winnipeg prior to surgery and producing quantities of the viral medium needed to transport testing swabs to laboratories. 

	In addition to testing, Dynacare call centre staff have been communicating negative test results to Manitobans and delivering COVID-19 test specimens from screening and assessment centres to CPL. They have also established specimen collection centres for patients with compromised immune systems.
	 
	Manitobans are reminded that if they are showing symptoms of COVID-19 and meet testing criteria, they can call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 for more information.

April 28, 2020
STATEMENT FROM PREMIER BRIAN PALLISTER ON NATIONAL DAY OF MOURNING


	Manitoba is joining with jurisdictions across Canada in proclaiming April 28 as a National Day of Mourning and observing a minute of silence at 11 a.m. for workers and their families who have been affected by workplace injury and illness.

	Today, we pause to remember and honour those who died of work-related causes and those whose lives have been forever impacted by injury and illness.

	In 2019, 19 Manitobans died as a result of occupational illness and acute hazards. They are mourned by their families, friends and coworkers.

	As we remember them, we are renewing our commitment to keep Manitoban safe and healthy in the workplace.

	We will continue to work together with employers and other partners toward our common goal of bringing Manitobans home safe from work each and every day.

	While we cannot remember these workers in person today due to COVID-19 restrictions, virtual events are being held in Winnipeg to commemorate and honour them. The flags at the main entrance of the Legislative Building have been lowered today to mark this important day of reflection and action.

	More than ever, we need to be mindful of safety and health on the job. I want to recognize Manitoba’s front-line health-care workers who show courage and dedication in fighting COVID-19 every day. I encourage all Manitobans to take a moment of reflection today.

	Manitoba is joining more than 80 countries around the world to observe this day of mourning.

PROVINCE INTRODUCES CHANGES TO MANITOBA BIRTH CERTIFICATES


	The Manitoba government has introduced policy changes to create more inclusive birth certificates, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“In response to a ruling from the Manitoba Human Rights Commission, the Vital Statistics Agency is implementing policy changes to be more inclusive to Manitobans,” Fielding said.

	The changes will allow individuals to select a non-binary option, in addition to male or female, when applying for a change of sex designation under The Vital Statistics Act.

	The Vital Statistics Agency has updated its policy and forms to comply with this change.  

	In a November 2019 decision, the Manitoba Human Rights Commission (MHRC) required the province to recognize and implement policies to allow for non-binary sex designations by May 2, 2020. The policy change ensures Manitoba complies with the MHRC ruling.

	The Manitoba government has taken the additional step of introducing a legislative change that would remove the requirement to display sex designation on birth and death certificates. The minister noted this legislation has not yet passed, as the opposition has refused to let the bill proceed to second reading.

	Updated information for Manitobans is available at www.vitalstats.gov.mb.ca.

	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre reports the outflow from Shellmouth Reservoir will be increasing today to 1,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) from 25 cfs as part of normal spring operation.

	This will result in a two- to three-foot increase on levels along the Assiniboine River from the Shellmouth Reservoir to Russell, and a one- to two-ft. increase from Russell to Brandon. Water level increases will diminish as the river moves downstream from Brandon.

	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre will continue to monitor conditions on the upper Assiniboine River as well as downstream river levels.

GOVERNMENTS OF CANADA AND MANITOBA ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR LOCAL FOOD PRODUCERS AND FARMERS' MARKETS
					  Developing New Marketing Options Will Strengthen Distribution Network


	The governments of Canada and Manitoba will be supporting a project, which will allow local food producers and farmers’ markets to sell their products online, federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“Farmers and food processors across the agri-food value chain are working hard to make sure Canadians continue to have access to their high quality and affordable food. Our government, along with of our provincial counterparts, is working step by step to support our producers as they provide an essential service to all Canadians,” said Bibeau. “By creating a centralized online platform for Manitoban producers to sell their products, we are increasing flexibility in the supply chain during a very challenging time.”

	“Increasing access to Manitoba’s diverse selection of foods grown or processed in the province will build resiliency in our food system and proactively address concerns about food insecurity,” said Pedersen. “Developing new marketing options at a time when important outlets such as restaurants, retail and farmers’ markets are disrupted will help strengthen distribution of local food to Manitoba customers.”

	Canada and Manitoba will be providing a total of $160,000 through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership to Direct Farm Manitoba to purchase a software platform that will allow Manitobans to order food online from local producers and farmers’ markets. The funding will also go toward the development of a network of pickup and delivery options to connect consumers with their orders, and the development of COVID-19 safe handling and packaging practices for producers and processors.

	“Canadians have always been able to count on farmers for good, healthy food. It has never been more important for our food supply to be reliable and diverse,” said Phil Veldhuis, president, Direct Farm Manitoba. “We have been working hard to connect consumers directly to local farmers. We appreciate this investment to reinforce our local food system at this time of crisis.”

	The five-year, $3-billion Canadian Agricultural Partnership includes $2 billion for cost-shared strategic initiatives delivered by the provinces and territories and $1 billion for federal programs and services. For more information, visit www.canada.ca/Agri-Partnership.

PROVINCE FINALIZING ADDITIONAL CARE OPTIONS TO ENSURE CONTINUED ACCESS TO CARE DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC


backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is working with physicians to ensure Manitobans can access care virtually as part of the province’s broader plan for delivering medical services during the pandemic response, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today. 

	 

	“During the pandemic and time of physical distancing, our government is taking action to meet the ongoing needs of Manitobans for health-care services,” said Friesen. “As conventional ways of seeing a doctor are disrupted because of COVID-19, our government continues to act to find innovative ways to enable Manitobans to access family physicians and specialists by telephone or video conference to supplement traditional models of care.”

	 

	In March, the Manitoba government was one of the first provinces to develop time-limited virtual options for primary care visits and psychotherapy care provided by psychiatrists. This has been effective in helping patients receive clinical care without a physical trip to a doctor’s office while also reducing the utilization of personal protective equipment.

	 

	Today, in collaboration with medical leadership and Doctors Manitoba, the Manitoba government has added further time-limited tariffs for additional virtual services, including virtual primary care visits for residents of personal care homes who need routine care for chronic illnesses, ensuring they receive the care they need during the pandemic. 

	 

	These new clinical options for patients have been developed to address the significant drop in patient visits to a physician since the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Manitoba. It is expected that these new tariffs will permit physicians to continue to shift their clinical interactions with patients from in-person to a virtual setting. Use of these new tariffs will only be permitted when a virtual appointment is appropriate and demonstrates equal clinical-value to an in-person interaction between a physician and patient. 

	 

	“These new options will make it easier for physicians to provide care virtually during the pandemic, which is especially important in personal care homes,” said Dr. Jose Francois, provincial specialty lead in family medicine, Shared Health. “This will ensure physicians are able to provide continued quality care to vulnerable residents, helping them maintain their health while keeping them safe.”

	 

	The minister noted the province has already made a $4.5-million investment in virtual therapy resources to support the needs of Manitobans during the pandemic. The AbilitiCBT program is a free and confidential virtual-therapy platform and has proven to be one of the most effective and efficient therapy methods available. In addition to this work, the province is introducing support for services by telephone or video to enable family physicians and specialists to help their patients Manitobans manage their mental health without having to leave home. Physicians will first direct patients seeking support for anxiety related to the pandemic to these on-line cognitive behavioural therapy resources unless there is an ongoing relationship with the patient.

	 

	Further options introduced today include:

	• consultation by telephone or video to enable family physicians and specialists to help Manitobans manage their acute, chronic and complex health conditions; 

	• consultation by developmental pediatricians for families who care for children with developmental difficulties, ensuring timely access to care from home; and 

	• chronic pain management assessments and followup appointments to ensure people have safe access to these care needs. 

	 

	“The investments we are making today support the implementation of Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan by bringing health care closer to the patient in a timely way,” said Friesen. “This particularly supports health-care services for those in rural and remote communities, as well as Manitobans with mobility issues and other barriers to care.”

	 

	The minister noted work is also underway to address how physicians can adapt their practices to provide services in other areas of the health-care system as needed during the pandemic.

	 

	“While case numbers are currently stable, we must continue to plan for times during this pandemic where we may see increased case numbers and higher demands on the health-care system,” said Friesen. “By doing this work now, we will be in a better position to help Manitobans access the care they need, when and where they need it.”

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR TRAILS IN MANITOBA PROVINCIAL PARKS


	The Manitoba government is investing up to $500,000 to support the development of trails in provincial parks, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires and Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard announced today.

	 

	“Our government is committed to continue building, maintaining and expanding Manitoba’s trail network over the long term in partnership with volunteer and community organizations like Trails Manitoba,” said Squires. “Accessing trails and pathways in a safe manner, while maintaining proper physical distancing, has become a respite during these unprecedented times. Trails can play an important role in our recovery and rebuilding following this pandemic.”

	 

	With the assistance of Trails Manitoba, funding announced today will allow for the completion of six trails in Manitoba provincial parks, helping link the 1,755-kilometre Great Trail in Manitoba including:

	• South Whiteshell Trail;

	• South Whiteshell Trail – Penniac Bay;

	• Cabin Lake Creek Pedestrian Bridge;

	• Centennial Trail – Hansons Creek Bridge Phase 2;

	• North Whiteshell emergency repair washout; and

	• Spruce Woods Provincial Park.

	 

	“Our government recognizes the positive impact in being able to connect with nature, now more than ever as Manitobans navigate this challenging time posed by the global health pandemic,” said Guillemard. “Trails Manitoba plays a valuable leadership role in the creation, maintenance and enhancement of trails across Manitoba, and we will continue to partner with organizations to provide Manitobans with more opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, all year long.”

	 

	“We are very grateful to the Province of Manitoba for its long-standing support of our provincial trail network,” said Erik Dickson, president, Trails Manitoba. “This funding will help improve safety and accessibility in several beloved trails in our beautiful provincial parks as well as promotes sustainability in the adaptive re-use of two pedestrian bridges from Kings Park in Winnipeg.”

	 

	Trails Manitoba was formed in 1993 to support growing interest in recreational trail development throughout the province. Trails Manitoba is now the umbrella organization for 22 trails associations and is governed by a volunteer board with regional representation.

PROVINCE HIGHLIGHTS ADAPTABILITY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19
					  Companies and Organizations Retooling to Help Keep Manitobans Safe: Helwer


	The Manitoba government is saluting Manitoba-based companies and organizations who are using their ingenuity in the fight against COVID-19, Central Services Minister Reg Helwer announced today.

	“Our government has put out a call to any business or group in Manitoba which can retool and help us keep Manitobans safe and healthy,” said Helwer. “The response has been outstanding and demonstrates our province’s community spirit and resourcefulness in working together to fight COVID-19.”

	Dozens of businesses and organizations across Manitoba have adapted operations to help provide the province with much-needed medical supplies. Some examples include:
	•    The Winnipeg location of Winpak, a firm that manufactures and distributes packaging materials and machines, answered the call for the production of 100,000 protective face shields. The Winpak division team in Winnipeg sprung into action with a synchronized effort between departments to find the appropriate materials to make prototypes. Winpak also enlisted other local vendors including Sur Seal Packaging, Hillary Production Machining and MacDon Industries to provide additional materials and labour to assist in assembling all the components required for the face shields. Starting April 27, Winpak will delivering 10,000 face shields per week to the Manitoba government. These shields will then be distributed to front-line health-care workers.
	•    Icon Technologies of Winkler has retooled its facility, which normally produces after-market RV/motorhome parts and custom plastic products, and are now producing much-needed face shields for the health-care system. With a sharp drop in demand due to COVID-19, Icon was facing the possibility of having to lay off most of its 60 employees. By transitioning to the manufacturing of face shields, it has been able to keep its entire workforce employed with a production level of up to 6000 shields per day. These shields are being supplied to Manitoba facilities and other neighbouring jurisdictions as well.
	•    Decker Colony in western Manitoba is one of a number of Hutterite colonies that have collectively produced and shipped an estimated 30,000 fabric-based masks for health-care facilities and other organizations and groups across Manitoba. These colonies have also produced other fabric and plastic-based products including gowns, ear savers and surgery caps. In one instance, Seven Oaks General Hospital supplied 30 bolts of cloth, which was used to make 1,000 hospital gowns. In addition to health-care facilities, products supplied by Manitoba Hutterite colonies have also been distributed to a number of First Nations across southern Manitoba, a women’s shelter in Brandon and the Kidney Foundation of Manitoba.

	“These are just some of the many examples of Manitobans finding creative solutions to help combat COVID-19,” added Helwer. “I want to extend sincere thanks to all the businesses and organizations who have joined this effort and invite others that may be able to retool operations to consider doing so. By working together, we can help keep Manitobans safe and healthy.”

	The Manitoba government continues to call on manufacturers, businesses and other organizations to assist in procurement efforts.

	The province is asking manufacturers or businesses to visit the COVID-19 portal at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/index.html if:
	•    they can rapidly scale up production or retool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19; or
	•    they have a stock of personal protective equipment that is not being used due to closures and physical distancing.

	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition. More information can be found at https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/.

MANITOBA TO JOIN ONTARIO IN TREATMENT OF EMERGENCY BENEFIT AS INCOME
					  People with Disabilities to Receive Additional Support: Stefanson


	Manitoba will be joining Ontario in ensuring that provincial Employment and Income Assistance (EIA) clients who are receiving the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) will have more money in their pockets and continue to receive needed health benefits, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“Individuals on EIA who qualify for the CERB will continue to receive the benefits they need to get through this difficult time,” said Stefanson. “This complements actions our government has already taken to support our most vulnerable citizens including investments made as part of our Manitoba Protection Plan. Our government will continue to support our most vulnerable citizens as we fight this pandemic together.”

	The federal CERB benefit will be treated as earned income under EIA. As a result, EIA clients who receive the CERB benefit will receive more than they would on EIA alone. They will also continue to receive prescription drug, dental and optical benefits regardless of whether they are still eligible for provincial social assistance. For example, by treating the CERB as earned income, a couple with two children will receive $2,270 per month under both programs while still qualifying for needed health benefits.

	In addition, individuals with disabilities who are new applicants to EIA will receive the same enhanced earnings exemption as existing clients. This change will make it easier for people with disabilities whose employment has been impacted by COVID-19 to receive EIA benefits in addition to the CERB.

	Families will also be able to keep the increased Canada Child Benefit and GST rebate without any impact to their EIA benefits, the minister noted.

	The province will work with clients to help them navigate the federal process and explain how it will affect their EIA benefits. This will include helping them resume receiving support from EIA once the CERB benefits end.

	The Manitoba government is taking all steps necessary to protect the health and safety of residents and reduce the spread of COVID-19. The EIA program continues to work with clients by telephone, email, fax, and online to provide support while helping to limit the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing.

	The EIA program has also extended coverage for health or medical needs, volunteer benefits and employment and training supports until further notice.

	Public health officials advise one new case of COVID-19 was identified as of 9:30 a.m. today, bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 263.

	The data also shows:
	•    seven individuals are currently hospitalized, which includes three individuals in intensive care;
	•    61 active cases and 196 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.

	As of yesterday, an additional 786 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 22,172.

	Over the past four weeks, a number of non-urgent surgical and diagnostic procedures have been postponed for patients identified as being clinically able to wait without risk of negative outcomes. Postponements are part of the provincial effort to ensure flexibility and availability in the allocation of staff, beds, equipment and supplies required to respond to COVID-19.

	Case-by-case clinical assessment has ensured urgent and emergent procedures, as well as those patients who may become urgent or emergent during the postponement timeframe, are completed. Patient safety and avoiding negative outcomes remain the priority.

	Over the next week, a number of facilities across the province will begin to increase their surgical activity. This includes increased surgical activity at Health Sciences Centre, the Pan Am Clinic, Concordia Hospital, Misericordia Health Centre, Grace Hospital, St. Boniface Hospital, Victoria General Hospital, Boundary Trails Health Centre, Selkirk Regional Health Centre and Brandon General Hospital.

	Surgeries will be scheduled for the most urgent cases first and all necessary precautions, including point of care testing, appropriate PPE and limiting the number of staff in the room to those who are essential for patient care, will be taken to protect staff and patients from the risk of COVID-19. Patients will be contacted directly about scheduling their surgery.

	Manitoba is part of a national effort to share important medical equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) and has agreed to divert 100 vital sign monitors to Quebec and Ontario – two of the hardest-hit provinces in the fight against COVID-19. The equipment was to arrive in Manitoba next week but will now be diverted to Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto and the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal. Manitoba is early in the response to COVID-19 and clinical leaders are confident the province is able to provide this assistance without risk to Manitobans. Another shipment of equipment is expected to arrive in Manitoba in about a month.

	Public health officials have expanded testing criteria. It is important for people who meet the criteria and are showing even mild symptoms of COVID-19, including a cough, a runny nose, a sore throat and a fever, to be tested to better determine the spread of the virus in Manitoba.

	Manitobans are reminded that if they are showing symptoms of COVID-19 and meet testing criteria, they can call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 for more information.

	Public health is also advising people to remain within or close to their home communities. This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only. Visits to cottages are not recommended at this time. Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

	Manitobans needing assistance to cope with the stress and anxiety created by COVID-19 are encouraged to access the online virtual therapy program. The program is a free and confidential behavioural-therapy service for all Manitobans 16 years old and over. Services are available in English and French and can be accessed at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES UP TO $120 MILLION FOR MANITOBA SUMMER STUDENT RECOVERY PLAN
					  Initiative Will Help Students and Employers, Stimulate Manitoba's Economy During an Unprecedented Summer: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government has launched the Summer Student Recovery Plan, a new wage subsidy program to support high school and post-secondary students employed in the private and non-profit sectors, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“The new wage subsidy program will support our students and connect them to summer jobs that help pay for their studies and also provide the opportunity to gain valuable work experience,” said Pallister. “Students can help businesses adapt their workplaces for social distancing as work resumes and this new wage subsidy program will help offset staffing costs in this challenging time.”

	Under the new program, up to $120 million is available for employers to access a $7 per hour wage subsidy, up to a maximum of $5,000 per student. The program is open to Manitoba students aged 15 to 29, with an employment period from May 1 to Sept. 4. Employers can be subsidized to hire up to five students. Reimbursement will be provided at the end of the employment period, upon proof of payment of student wages.

	Employers must place students in jobs that can be accommodated under current public health orders and be able to adapt to recommendations provided by public health officials over the summer.

	For the first two weeks of the program, priority will be given to employers who do not qualify for the various federal government assistance programs.
	   
	“While we work toward carefully re-opening our economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, more opportunities will be available for students as the summer progresses,” said Pallister. “Our students need the support and experience, and the Summer Student Recovery Plan will help stimulate our economy and move Manitoba forward.”

	In addition to the subsidy program, Manitoba recently announced that it is deferring payments on student loans which will assist post-secondary students who are affected by the economic impact of COVID-19, the Premier noted.

MANITOBA PUBLIC INSURANCE TO ISSUE REBATE CHEQUES TO POLICYHOLDERS
					  Welcome Relief to Customers During COVID-19 Pandemic:  Wharton

Watch news conference





	Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) is returning up to $110 million to provide financial relief to its policyholders, Crown Services Minister Jeff Wharton announced today.

	“Many Manitobans have been financially impacted by this crisis,” said Wharton. “MPI is proactively providing relief when it is needed most by issuing rebates to its customers as an alternative to future reduced premiums.”

	Rebates will be based on what policyholders paid last year and expected to be around 11 per cent, or between $140 to $160, per average policyholder, the minister noted, adding policyholders can expect a rebate cheque at the end of May to early June.

	This surplus is the result of fewer claims during this COVID period, coupled with strong year-end financial results. As a public insurance model, MPI operates on a break-even basis and is required to maintain its reserves at a level set by legislation. Today’s rebate is possible because MPI’s reserves are exceptionally strong, allowing excess capital to be returned to ratepayers while ensuring its reserves are fully funded.

	“This money is expected to provide financial assistance to Manitobans during this unprecedented crisis,” said Ben Graham, president and CEO, MPI. “We have made significant improvements in our operations to deliver value to Manitobans resulting in stronger financial results.

	“With a healthy reserve fund, MPI is in a strong financial situation to move forward with these rebate cheques to support our customers. This rebate to our customers will not adversely impact the corporation’s financial outcomes moving forward. It feels right to give back to our customers when they need it the most.”

	Details of the rebates will be made in the coming weeks and further details will be available at www.mpi.mb.ca/Pages/Home.aspx.

	In addition to rebating excess capital from the last financial year, MPI notes that as of mid-April, collision claims are down 48 per cent compared to the same month a year ago. MPI estimates that public health orders directing the public to stay at home and for non-essential businesses to cease direct interaction with the public have resulted in approximately $29 million in fewer basic claims being incurred between March 15 and April 15, 2020.

	Under existing legislation, MPI is able to return approximately $50 million to its ratepayers and will require the approval of the Public Utilities Board (PUB) for the additional $60 million. MPI will apply to the PUB in the coming days in respect of the incremental $60 million in order to be able to return these amounts to Manitoba ratepayers. If PUB approval is obtained in the next few weeks, the entire $110 million will be returned as part of the rebate cheques mailed to Manitobans.

	Based on current projections, MPI is confident that due to the extension of public health orders and the provincial state of emergency extending until May 18, related savings to the corporation will continue into the foreseeable future.

					  Arrival of PPE Will Help Support Front-line Fight Against COVID-19: Helwer


	The Manitoba government is welcoming the arrival of a large order of personal protective equipment (PPE) to help in the fight against COVID-19, Central Services Minister Reg Helwer announced today.

	“Our government has committed $400 million for the COVID-19 Procurement Fund as part of our Manitoba Protection Plan,” said Helwer. “Thanks to our ongoing procurement efforts, we are very pleased to have taken delivery of a substantial order of personal protective equipment for our front-line health-care workers.”

	This shipment, which landed in Winnipeg Tuesday afternoon on a chartered Air Canada Boeing 777, contains 150,000 disposable isolation gowns. This order was supplied by SpiritRx Services, a Manitoba-based medical supply company owned by the Spirit Healthcare Group representing the seven tribal councils of Manitoba.

	“The Spirit Healthcare Group was pleased to have had the opportunity to work with the Manitoba government,” said Heather Berthelette, CEO, Spirit Healthcare Group, and Chief Dennis Meeches, board chair. “Our First Nations, Manitoba-based company was able to source and supply this much-needed personal protective equipment required by the province.”

	“We want to thank all of our partners who helped ensure the successful delivery of this vitally important personal protective equipment,” Helwer said. “Our government will continue to source and acquire the PPE and other supplies needed to keep Manitobans safe and ensure that our province wins in the fight against COVID-19.”

	The Manitoba government continues to call on manufacturers, businesses and other organizations to assist in procurement efforts.

	The province is asking manufacturers or businesses to visit the COVID-19 portal at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/index.html if:
	•    they can rapidly scale up production or retool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19; or
	•    they have a stock of personal protective equipment that is not being used due to closures and physical distancing.

	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition. More information can be found at https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/.

PROVINCE TO PROVIDE $120 MILLION OF SUPPORT TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES HARMED BY COVID-19
					  Manitoba Businesses are Struggling, We Want to Support Them: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is providing up to $120 million to support Manitoba’s small and medium-sized businesses that are facing significant challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Manitoba’s small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of our economy. They are struggling right now and we want to support them,” said Pallister. “Our government has been listening and working diligently with chambers of commerce across the province, business and retail councils, industry and trade associations and various stakeholders to identity where the greatest need is and to maximize the recovery opportunities for Manitoba’s business sector.”

	The Manitoba Gap Protection Program (MGPP) is available to any of the approximately 120,000 businesses in Manitoba who have fallen into a gap in failing to qualify for the various federal government assistance programs and wage subsidies created because of COVID-19. If one in six businesses have fallen into that gap that would mean approximately 20,000 Manitoba businesses would be entitled to this support, the premier noted.
	 
	The province will advance each eligible business the non-interest bearing forgivable MGPP loan of $6,000, for a total of up to $120 million. The loan will be forgiven on Dec. 31, 2020, if the recipient attests at that time the business has not received any major non-repayable COVID-19 federal supports such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Business Account, as well as sector-specific grant federal programs specifically developed in response to the pandemic. If the applicant has received benefits under a federal COVID program, then the loan will be added to the recipient’s 2020 tax bill.

	“We are acting on the advice from industry and are committed to working in partnership with our municipal and federal governments and various associations that are impacted by this pandemic so we’ll make the right decisions, in the right way, at the right time to maximize our recovery efforts for the benefit of all Manitobans,” said Pallister.

	To be eligible for the MGPP funding, a business must:
	•    have been operational on March 20, 2020, the date the Manitoba government declared a provincewide state of emergency under The Emergency Measures Act because of COVID-19;
	•    have temporarily ceased or curtailed operations as a result of a COVID-19 public health order and have been harmed by the health order;
	•    be registered and in good standing with the Manitoba Business and Corporate Registry;
	•    have not qualified for federal government COVID-19 grant support; and
	•    have an email address and a bank account.

RED RIVER REACHES PEAK FLOWS IN MANITOBA
					  River Crests at Lower Predicted Range for Spring 2020: Schuler

Watch news conference




	The Red River crest has arrived in southern Manitoba at its lower predicted range, Infrastructure Minster Ron Schuler announced today.

	“This is good news as the substantial run-off we’re seeing throughout the Red River Basin will remain at the lower end of the forecast, with levels similar to those we saw in 2006 at Emerson and Letellier and levels closer to 2019 north from St. Jean Baptiste,” said Schuler. “We always prepare for the worst but hope for the best, and so far the weather has co-operated. Cooler temperatures have slowed the melt and helped control high water in Manitoba, and we aren’t expecting any major spring storms in the week ahead.”

	The Red River has crested from Emerson to St. Jean Baptiste. Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 at Morris is expected to remain open, as an earthen ramp has been constructed at the north end of Morris so traffic can continue to use the highway. The river is expected to peak today at Morris, Ste. Agathe and St. Adolphe, and within the next 24 hours at the Red River Floodway inlet south of Winnipeg. A flood warning remains in place for the river from Emerson to the Red River Floodway inlet.

	Provincial crews were deployed in a number of communities in the Red River Valley to close ring dikes as required. Pumping operations are underway at most ring dike communities. Response teams are observing recommended public health measures for COVID-19.

	Operation of the floodway continues to reduce water levels in Winnipeg. The Red River level is around 18.7 feet at James Avenue with the crest forecast to arrive within the next two days at between 19 and 19.3 ft., maintained by floodway operation. The current flow in the floodway channel is almost 20,000 cubic feet per second.

	The Red River is now projected to return within bank in early May. The Red River Floodway will likely continue operations until mid-May depending on future weather conditions.

	The minister noted that levels are reducing along the Red River in North Dakota, currently at 18.2 ft. in Fargo and 35.6 ft. in Grand Forks. At this time, there is sufficient capacity in the channel to withstand a major storm.

	Downstream north of Winnipeg, the ice cleared out a few days ago so ice dam-related high water is no longer an issue. A high water advisory remains in place for the Red River from Lockport to Netley Creek as water levels remain high and will continue to rise as the peak moves down the river.

	Lake Winnipeg is at 714.9 ft. while Lake Manitoba is at 811.4 ft., both within operating levels. The province has issued, and will continue to issue, high wind and ice pileup warnings as required as the ice dissipates.

	The Assiniboine River and northern rivers such as the Saskatchewan and Carrot near The Pas are forecast to remain mostly in bank. The Assiniboine peak is forecast to reach Winnipeg tomorrow, with little or no influence on James Avenue levels in Winnipeg. Ice jams on the Saskatchewan and Carrot rivers could cause temporary over-bank high water. The Portage Diversion ceased operations yesterday.

	A number of roads are impacted by high water levels including parts of Provincial Road (PR) 217, PR 246 and PR 320. For detours and a complete list of closures, visit www.manitoba511.ca.

	The Hydrologic Forecast Centre provides daily high water reports at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/floodinfo/index.html.

	Public health officials have expanded testing criteria to ensure there is capacity to do additional testing. It is important for people showing symptoms of COVID-19, including a cough, a runny nose, a sore throat and a fever, to be tested to better determine the spread of the virus in Manitoba.

	Manitobans are reminded that if they are showing symptoms of COVID-19 and meet testing criteria, they should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257.

	Public health officials advise Manitobans to stay home as much as possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This includes only travelling to the cottage or second residence if needed. If people must travel, they are encourage to:
	•    only travel with family members,
	•    not visit with others on arrival,
	•    avoid stopping for gas or other supplies on the way, and
	•    only visit local health-care providers in case of emergency.

	Manitoba health officials are taking every available and appropriate step to protect the province’s health-care workforce from exposure to COVID-19 so they are able to take care of sick and vulnerable Manitobans over the coming weeks and months. This includes steps to enhance screening at all health-care facilities, implement visitor restrictions, encourage virtual visit options and postpone non-essential services.

	Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a supplement to these and other measures including strict hand hygiene and both social and physical distancing.

	Similar to other jurisdictions, Manitoba has engaged experts in infection prevention and control, and occupational and environmental health and safety to identify the supplies required to protect workers in critical and priority services.

	Settings and situations have been categorized according to the level of risk to workers and to the population they are caring for and the required PPE has been set out accordingly. These include:
	•    green zones, which are settings and situations involving care or service for individuals who are not considered COVID-19 suspects;
	•    orange zones, which are settings and situations involving care or service for individuals who meet the criteria for COVID-19 testing, AND who have been tested AND whose results are pending; and
	•    red zones, which are settings and situations involving care or service for individuals who have been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19.

	To conserve PPE for health-care workers, public health officials are recommending all people who enter a health-care facility wear a cloth mask to protect others. In addition, patients and clients are encouraged to wear non-medical face masks during any health-care interaction, as well as when using public transit, handi-transit or a taxi.

WORKERS COMPENSATION BOARD OF MANITOBA RETURNS $37-MILLION SURPLUS TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL RELIEF TO EMPLOYERS
					  Welcome Relief to Manitoba Employers During COVID-19 Pandemic: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba is returning a $37-million surplus to provide financial relief to eligible employers in the province, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“The COVID-19 pandemic is having a dramatic impact on employers across the province, with businesses especially hurting right now, and we’re working across government and with our partners to find ways to provide relief to employers that need it,” said Pallister. “Given the economic uncertainties, these actions will provide money to employers at a time where cash flow is a challenge.”

	The Workers Compensation Board (WCB) board of directors has approved and authorized further relief for employers who fund the WCB by returning approximately $37 million in surplus funds.

	“The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the majority of our customers and we have actively explored how we can help mitigate the financial impact to employers,” said Michael Werier, chairperson of the WCB. “With a healthy reserve fund, we are pleased to provide a refund of approximately 20 per cent to employers to help bolster their bottom line. It’s incumbent upon businesses like ourselves to do our part to actively help support financial recovery efforts over the next several months.”

	This is the second year the WCB has returned surplus funds to eligible employers while still maintaining the lowest assessment rate in Canada. In making this decision, the WCB’s board of directors considered the long-term financial projections in conjunction with maintaining rate stability and still protecting the workers compensation system against risk, uncertainty and market volatility.

	In May, eligible employers will receive a credit to their account based on 20 per cent of their 2019 premium. To be eligible to receive the surplus, employers must have fulfilled their payroll reporting responsibilities for 2019 and paid a WCB premium in 2019. Employers can still report their 2019 payroll to receive the surplus distribution.

	For the health-care sector, which includes regional health authorities and several other agencies such as CancerCare Manitoba, Riverview Health Centre and personal care homes, this equals an approximate $6.2-million refund.

	Of the $37 million, WCB expects $29 million will be returned to the private sector, with approximately $7 million going to small businesses in Manitoba.

	“We are proud the work we’ve done over the years to increase our system efficiency allows us to have the lowest WCB rate in Canada and we can now offer some measure of relief to employers suffering the financial hardships COVID-19 has created,” said Winston Maharaj, president and CEO, WCB. “We applaud all of the employers and front-line workers who continue to serve the public in these extremely challenging times.”

	Earlier this month, WCB announced it would defer premium payments until the end of May, not charge business interest and/or penalties for non-payment until October, extend the payroll-reporting deadline until the end of May and ensure that coverage remains active for accounts that choose to defer payments until the end of October. Clearances will remain in good standing.

	The WCB is a mutual workplace injury and disability statutory corporation funded by employer premiums. It insures more than 34,000 employers and 76 per cent of the Manitoba workforce.

	Public health officials advise one new case of COVID-19 was identified as of 9:30 a.m. today, bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 254. In addition, a sixth death has been reported, a woman in her 80s. No other patient-specific information is available at this time.

	The data also shows:
	•    eight individuals are currently hospitalized, which includes five individuals in intensive care;
	•    105 active cases and 144 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is now six.

	On March 20, the Manitoba government declared a provincewide state of emergency under The Emergency Measures Act, to protect the health and safety of all Manitobans and reduce the spread of COVID-19. This state of emergency is being extended for an additional 30 days.

	This builds on the expansion of public health orders that limit the size of gatherings, close restaurants and non-critical businesses, require people entering Manitoba to self-isolate for 14 days and restrict travel to northern Manitoba (north of the 53rd parallel of latitude).

	Extending the state of emergency will ensure measures can stay in place to protect the health of people across the province.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 260 tests on Sunday. A total of 20,012 tests have been performed since early February. Public health officials have continued to expand testing criteria and want to ensure all those who are eligible for testing are tested. Anyone who thinks they might meet the criteria for testing should call Health Links–Info Santé or work through the online screening tool to determine if they should be tested.

	Testing is focused on symptomatic people from the following categories:
	•    travellers returning to Manitoba;
	•    close contact with a confirmed case;
	•    lab workers who have worked with COVID-19 tests;
	•    health-care workers;
	•    people who live/work in the north, isolated or group settings, correctional facilities, shelters, long-term care or residential facilities or remote work camps;
	•    first responders;
	•    workers or volunteers at workplaces that have been identified as essential services; and
	•    any symptomatic person who lives with a health-care worker, first responder or worker in a congregate setting such as a correctional facility, shelter, long-term care or residential facility.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

COVID-19 PROCUREMENT BULLETIN #4


	Today, the Manitoba government is renewing its request for medical gloves and masks to support the province’s response to COVID-19.

	Specifically, Manitoba is urgently seeking the following items:
	•    nitrile gloves,
	•    vinyl gloves,
	•    N95 masks, and
	•    testing swabs.

	As a part of the Manitoba Protection Plan, the province has invested $400 million to accelerate the pace of procurement of supplies to combat COVID-19.

	Since the initial call for assistance went out, Manitoba businesses and organizations have stepped up both through donations and through the province’s procurement process.

	The province has partnered with a well-established Manitoba company to retool its production lines to supply Level 1 isolation gowns for Manitoba front-line health-care workers. MWG Apparel Corp. has been contracted to provide up to 200,000 gowns to the Manitoba government on a priority basis. This contract will immediately support 43 jobs in Manitoba. The province applauds MWG for its efforts and thanks them for joining the fight against COVID-19 in Manitoba.

	Manitoba manufacturers or businesses able to provide supplies and those who are prepared to retool and rapidly scale up production lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19 are asked to visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19supplies to register their interest.

	Shared Health has also issued a call to businesses who have personal protective equipment on hand. If your business has needed supplies that are in original packaging, clean and in usable condition and you are interested in donating the requested items, visit https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/. Drop-off locations exist across Manitoba in Winnipeg, Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Selkirk, Winkler and Steinbach.

PROVINCE LAUNCHES NEWLY DESIGNED WEBSITE FOR BILINGUAL SERVICE CENTRES


	The Manitoba government has redesigned its bilingual service centres website to make it easier for Manitobans to find the services and information they need online, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires, minister responsible for francophone affairs, announced today.

	“The website offers a more user-friendly experience, with a streamlined, modern design and improved navigation,” said Squires. “Our government is committed to improving Manitobans’ access to services in French, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when online services have never been more critical.”

	The bilingual service centres offer a one-stop shop where Manitobans can access information about programs offered by all three levels of government and numerous community organizations.

	The website is designed to help the public navigate government services more easily and find the appropriate program areas to contact for additional information across a wide variety of sectors.

	There are six bilingual service centres in Manitoba, located in the designated bilingual regions of the province, which have a concentration of French-speaking residents. Each centre is unique to the region, and staff are available to help residents in the official language of their choice – French or English. The Francophone Affairs Secretariat administers the centres.

	The centres are located in:  
	•    Winnipeg:
	      -    St. Boniface at 204-945-6220;
	      -    St. Vital/St. Norbert at 204-945-0600;
	•    St-Pierre-Jolys (Red River Region) at 204-433-3340;
	•    Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes (Mountain Region) at 204-248-7270;
	•    St. Laurent (Interlake Region) at 204-646-4095; and
	•    Ste. Anne (Seine River Region) at 204-422-7020.

	To help minimize the spread of COVID-19, drop-in services are unavailable at the bilingual service centres at this time, but staff continue to provide assistance to the public by telephone (toll-free) at1-866-267-6114 or email at csbsc@gov.mb.ca.

					  Additional Funds for Manitoba Protection Plan Ensures Quick, Effective Government Response to Global Pandemic:  Helwer

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is investing an additional $300 million to ensure the government can respond quickly to front-line health-care needs and protect vulnerable Manitobans, Central Services Minister Reg Helwer announced today.

	“Our government has already fast-tracked $100 million in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 through our Manitoba Protection Plan,” said Helwer. “Today, we’re quadrupling our commitment to $400 million for the COVID-19 Procurement Fund to ensure our plan is effective and that we can continue to be proactive in the steps we take to protect Manitobans during this pandemic.”

	This investment will support outbreak planning, prevention and mitigation efforts, and allow the province to secure the supplies and resources needed to deliver the best care possible for Manitoba patients.

	Funds are being used for purposes such as:
	•    purchasing significant amounts of essential medical supplies and equipment, including personal protective equipment;
	•    developing hotel capacity for those requiring isolation;
	•    preparing for large-scale low acuity medical overflow for hospitals;
	•    supporting the local, made-in-Manitoba production of gowns, scrubs, gloves and other medical equipment including an RFP to award $15 million of production to Manitoba-designed reusable silicone N95 masks;
	•    providing training and grants to child-care experts to become entrepreneurs by opening their own small-scale daycares;
	•    establishing a COVID-19 research fund through Research Manitoba;
	•    providing a new digital online service for mental health support;
	•    creating https://helpnextdoormb.ca/ to link Manitobans needing help with volunteers;
	•    engaging local call centre, 24-7 Intouch, to contact Manitobans to drive awareness of government support programs to small businesses, charities and not-for-profits; and
	•    opening multiple provincewide testing sites to bolster the response to this health crisis.

	“This new investment continues to address the needs of our front-line health-care workers and patients,” said Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen. “Our government is taking every step possible to protect Manitoba families and ensure people are able to get the care they need during this critical time.”

	The Manitoba government has also undertaken a number of investments to provide immediate relief to Manitobans facing financial challenges by deferring provincial fees and charges, funding support for child-care services for critical service providers and expanding shelter capacity to support people affected by homelessness, noted Helwer.

	The province is asking manufacturers or businesses to visit the COVID-19 portal at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/index.html if:
	•    they can rapidly scale up production or re-tool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19; or
	•    they have a stock of personal protective equipment that is not being used due to closures and physical distancing.

	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition. More information can be found at https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/.

	The chief provincial public health officer has updated public health orders that take effect on April 17, and will be in effect until May 1, 2020. They mandate that anyone entering Manitoba, regardless of whether it was from another country or another province must self-isolate for 14 days. In addition, travel to northern Manitoba (north of the 53rd parallel of latitude) is prohibited with some exceptions including:
	•    residents of northern and remote communities may continue to move within the north;
	•    delivery of goods and services may continue; and
	•    exceptions include those who travel to the north for employment, medical treatment or to facilitate child-custody agreements.

	The new orders build on the current orders, and maintain the gathering size of no more than 10 people at any indoor or outdoor premises. Additional updates include:
	•    a clarification that businesses not listed as critical may operate, and have customers attend to pick up ordered items, providing social distancing measures are in place;
	•    a provision to allow farmers markets to operate, providing social distancing measures are in place;
	•    hotels may operate, but must close common areas such as pools, hot tubs and game rooms;

	•    appliance, electronic and furniture stores are excluded, and should not be open to the public, except where orders are placed remotely and orders are delivered or picked up with social distancing measures in place.

	The following restrictions remain in place as they were with previous orders:
	•    All restaurants and other commercial facilities are prohibited from serving food to customers in their premises. This prevents eat-in dining at all facilities. However, restaurants and other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or takeout. If this takes place, the operator of the restaurant must ensure that all people maintain the appropriate social distancing from other customers when picking up food.
	•    All businesses that are not listed in the schedule of critical services that accompanies the order must remain closed.
	-    This closure order does not prevent these businesses from operating on a remote basis.
	-    A business may accept orders on the internet or over the phone for delivery or pickup, as long as the employees are not working at the place of business.
	-    The order does not prevent employees or others from coming into the business to perform repairs, to provide security services or to take out items from the business premises if the business is going to operate on a remote basis.
	-    Nothing in the order restricts the operations of delivery of services by the federal or provincial governments or a municipality.
	-    Nothing in the order restricts any activities of a publicly funded agency, organization or authority that delivers or supports government operations or services including health-care services. This means the order does not affect institutions, agencies and other service providers offering health-care services such as hospitals, regional health authorities and private agencies that provide a range of health services.

	In addition, public health officials are expanding testing criteria to include:
	•    all symptomatic workers or volunteers at workplaces that have been identified as essential services; and
	•    any symptomatic person who lives with a health-care worker, first responder or worker in a congregate setting such as a correctional facility, shelter, long-term care or residential facility.

INTERNET-BASED THERAPY SERVICE PROGRAM TO HELP MANITOBANS COPE WITH COVID-19 ANXIETY NOW LIVE
					  Province Invests $4.5 Million in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Program to Support Manitobans:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	A digital cognitive behavioural therapy program to support the mental health of Manitobans and help address anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is now up and running, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“We recognize many Manitobans are living with anxiety and stress posed by this pandemic,” said Pallister. “Our government is committed to helping Manitobans navigate this challenging and unprecedented time. You are not alone, we will get through this together.”

	The AbilitiCBT program is a free and confidential virtual-therapy platform and has proven to be one of the most effective and efficient therapy methods available, the premier added.

	As of this morning, close to 600 individuals have registered for the program, and are now using the virtual-therapy platform with more signing up daily. 

	The program is guided by professional therapists and addresses mild to moderate anxiety symptoms related to the uniquely challenging aspects of pandemics:
	•    uncertainty,
	•    physical isolation,
	•    caring for family and community members,
	•    information overload, and
	•    stress management.

	The program will help people:
	•    learn what anxiety is and how it affects their emotions, mind, body and behaviour;
	•    reduce anxiety by learning cognitive behavioral-therapy skills and using them to change responses to triggers; and
	•    develop coping strategies to track and reduce anxiety and better manage daily activities.

	The premier noted people do not need to be referred to the program by a doctor, they can start at any time by completing the online assessment on the website.

	Once people register online, they are asked to download an app, as well as to complete and submit a health-screening questionnaire. A therapist will reach out within three days to book an initial assessment by phone.

	People will then complete 10 modules on the app at their own pace, while the therapist tracks and monitors progress. There will be scheduled check-ins along the way by phone, chat or through a video check-in to make sure people are getting the help they need.

	The internet-based cognitive behavioural-therapy service is free of charge to all Manitobans 16 years old and over. Services are available in English and French. The program can be accessed at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Crisis mental-health services continue to be available through partner organizations in Manitoba at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/crisis.html.

MANITOBA OFFICIALLY ADOPTS NEW WEST PARTNERSHIP TRADE AGREEMENT
					  Proclamation of Legislative Provisions and Regulations to Adopt Agreement Will Expand Province's Trade Markets, Increase Business Opportunities and Create Jobs:  Eichler


	Manitoba has proclaimed the final legislative provisions and regulations necessary to officially adopt the New West Partnership Trade Agreement that will bring the province new and exciting opportunities for private-sector investment and job creation, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“The adoption of this trade agreement with the three other western provinces brings Manitoba into a new and exciting era in positioning itself for economic growth,” said Eichler. “Our province will move forward and prosper through diversified markets for trade and the creation of quality jobs, while our participation in the agreement strengthens the economic potential of the four jurisdictions as a whole.”

	Manitoba entered the New West Partnership with Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia in 2016, creating an open and common trade market of more than 11 million people with a combined GDP of more than $750 billion. The Manitoba government cabinet’s new proclamation this week has brought into force provisions of the Business Names Registration Act, the Partnerships Act, the Corporations Act and the Cooperatives Act, as well as regulatory changes, to enable reciprocal registrations of businesses across the four provinces and an elimination of unnecessary and antiquated fees for them.

	The New West Partnership Trade Agreement commits each of the four western provinces to enhance trade, investment and labour mobility, and to remove barriers to the movement of goods, services, investment and people within and between the jurisdictions. Manitoba companies and families will benefit from improved business opportunities through the partnership, which covers more than 30 per cent of Canada’s population.

	“The potential through the New West Partnership for the creation of quality jobs is in step with our government’s Manitoba Works program, which aims to generate 40,000 new jobs in our province over the next four years,” said Eichler. “This trade agreement brings opportunities for new growth, and has long been called for by Manitoba business owners and chambers of commerce. It’s a chance for Manitoba to take advantage of its enormous potential with its resource wealth and its central location in Canada and North America.”

	Manitoba’s entry to the New West Partnership, which was formed in 2010 by the governments of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, strengthens and expands Canada’s largest, barrier-free interprovincial market. By adopting the agreement, Manitoba is strengthening its industries and positioning itself to prosper in the national economy while making families across the province safer and stronger.

	Public health officials advise two new cases of COVID-19 were identified as of 9:30 a.m. today. In addition, two cases that had been considered probable have been ruled as negative, so the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba remains at 246. In addition, a fifth death has been reported, a woman in her 60s who lived in the Prairie Mountain Health region.

	The data also shows:
	•    nine individuals are currently hospitalized, which includes four individuals in intensive care;
	•    132 active cases and 108 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is now five.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 305 tests Tuesday. A total of 17,902 tests have been performed since early February.

	Manitobans should not interpret current case numbers to mean the risk of COVID-19 is reduced. The current statistics may be a reflection of the effect strict social distancing measures have had and reaffirms that these measures must be continued.

	The second Community COVID-19 Testing Site and Assessment Clinic in Winnipeg opened today at Sergeant Tommy Prince Place, 90 Sinclair St. The site will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week. This new site will assume testing responsibilities from Mount Carmel Clinic, which will return to its mandate of offering primary care services to the community. The first co-located testing site and assessment clinic opened at the St. James Centennial Pool last week.  

	Assessment clinics for COVID-19 patients offer primary care services on an appointment basis for anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or has respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat or shortness of breath. In addition to the primary care space, these locations also serve as designated testing sites in a separate area at the site.

	Health officials continue to remind Manitobans to seek medical attention when it is required. For serious health issues call 911, go to an emergency department or an urgent care centre. Hospitals are safe places and health-care providers will ensure every precaution is taken while providing care.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

PROVINCE INVESTING MORE THAN $1.5 MILLION IN NEW MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS IN DAUPHIN, WINNIPEG TO SUPPORT MANITOBA FAMILIES
					  This First-for-Manitoba Peer Support Program Will Help Individuals and Families, Regardless of Their Mental Health Diagnosis:  Friesen


	The Manitoba government is investing more than $1.5 million over three years in a new initiative to provide peer and family support services in Winnipeg and the Prairie Mountain Health region, led by the Manitoba Schizophrenia Society, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Peer support services have shown significant results in other jurisdictions in reducing inpatient hospital admissions, decreasing length of stay and rates of re-admission, and improving patient and family experiences in crisis situations,” said Friesen.

	The Manitoba Schizophrenia Society will develop and offer a new program called Peer 2 Peer Connections services at Winnipeg’s Crisis Response Centre and the Dauphin Regional Health Centre.  The program will serve all individuals and families, regardless of their mental health diagnosis.

	“We are excited to implement the Peer 2 Peer Connections initiative in collaboration with Robyn Priest Live Your Truth within the Crisis Response Centre and Dauphin Regional Health Centre to demonstrate the importance of providing peer support along the mental health continuum of care,” said Julia Hoeppner, interim executive director, Manitoba Schizophrenia Society (MSS).  “This initiative will positively impact both individuals and families dealing with various mental health diagnosis as peer and family support workers share their stories of resiliency to light a path in the direction of wellness and recovery.”

	The equivalent of 12 new full-time individual and family peer support-worker positions will be created across the two sites, along with a manager to oversee the day-to-day operations of the program.

	In this unique program, people with their own lived experience of mental health or addictions issues will be able to offer support and insight for others experiencing similar challenges.

	Peer support programs offer an evidence-based service that uses the expertise of trained staff with lived experience to support the recovery of people struggling with mental health and addictions.

	Support staff work with clients and families from initial contact through ongoing support and post-discharge followup.

	Peer 2 Peer Connections fits well within the new MSS vision of ‘Mental Wellness for All’ and its mission, which is “to provide quality mental health education and value-based peer support for Manitobans and their families dealing with mental health challenges”.

	The minister noted the implementation of this first for Manitoba program will meet a recommendation from the VIRGO report, which identified peer support in formal health-care settings as a short-term priority.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT INTRODUCES AMENDMENTS TO STRENGTHEN THE EMERGENCY MEASURES ACT
					  Changes Will Give Province Increased Ability to Respond Effectively During a State of Emergency and Protect Vulnerable Manitobans:  Pallister


	The Manitoba government is making additions and amendments to strengthen The Emergency Measures Act and enable provincial orders that will aid in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“The Emergency Measures Amendment Act provides the provincial government with additional tools to respond to challenges that arise during a declared state of emergency and improve our response time to these challenges,” said Pallister. “These changes are part of the Manitoba Protection Plan to support the efforts of our front-line workers and protect Manitoba’s most vulnerable residents from the negative effects of COVID-19.”

	The amendments would allow decisive immediate action through provincial orders approved by the lieutenant-governor in council that take effect the day they are made and may have a retroactive effect to the start of the declared state of emergency.  

	“These order-making powers will give the province the ability to act swiftly to protect the safety and well-being of Manitobans and the resiliency of our province,” said Pallister. “They will reduce the negative impacts of public health emergencies and natural disasters and prevent people from taking advantage of other Manitobans.”

	The amendments would provide the provincial government with authority to make three types of orders:
	•    emergency orders, which allow the province to have greater ability to take decisive action to limit serious harm and damage to Manitobans, such as establishing facilities such as emergency shelters, fixing prices for necessary goods and services, and prohibiting price gouging;
	•    temporary suspension orders, which briefly suspend certain types of provisions in a statute, regulation or bylaw such as extending the length or a provincial permit or delaying filing deadlines if people affected by the emergency need greater services, benefits, or time than the law normally provides; and
	•    reporting deadline variation orders, which extend the time period for government or government agencies to file a report or information, such as extra time to prepare and table annual reports for the legislature during a declared state of emergency. The Speaker of the legislative assembly is also granted authority to issue an order for independent officers of the assembly and members of the legislative assembly.

	Currently, only the minister or a local authority may make emergency orders of a limited scope that directly limit loss of life or damage to property and the environment.

	Penalties for violating The Emergency Measures Act would increase to a maximum of $100,000 and/or one year imprisonment for individuals and a maximum of $1,000,000 for corporations.

	A new provision would also give courts the option to increase the fine for a person convicted of a price gouging offence by an amount equal to the financial benefit acquired.

	The amendments authorizing the provincial government to make emergency orders would be temporary and automatically rescinded after one year, while the other order powers would remain within legislation.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES UP TO $1 BILLION TO SUPPORT COVID-19 FIGHT
					  Increased Spending Authority will Provide Investments in Health and Across Government:  Pallister


	The Manitoba government is releasing up to $1 billion to support the government’s ongoing actions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“We are facing significant fiscal pressures as a result of the necessary shutdown of large parts of our economy as well as from the large expenses we hadn’t budgeted for that are now required to keep Manitobans safe,” said Pallister. “By increasing our spending power, we have funds at hand to quickly help those in need, whether it’s delivering personal protective equipment and other resources to front-line workers, helping families through access to child care and other supports, and aiding businesses through tax deferrals and other measures.”

	According to the Estimates of Expenditure documents tabled today, additional spending authority of up to $1 billion of COIVD-19 pandemic-related spending is requested to be allocated as follows:
	•    $500 million for the Health Services Insurance Fund,
	•    $400 million for the internal service adjustments appropriations of government, and
	•    $100 million for emergency expenditures.

	Half of the investment would be directly available for health-care costs, while $400 million would be available for allocation to new COVID-19 pandemic-related costs across the whole of government, allowing the flexibility to create new government programs or support services for Manitobans, or addressing increased costs under existing programs whose volumes have increased as a result of the pandemic.

	The province would also double the emergency expenditures budget with a second commitment of $100 million to address the costs of potential natural disasters later in the fiscal year, such as floods and forest fires, or even cover new emergency costs relating to the pandemic should they arise. The existing funding for emergency expenditures has been fully expended to cover COVID-19 costs.

	“We want to ensure we have available funds to meet anticipated and unexpected costs this fiscal year as a result of the pandemic,” said Finance Minister Scott Fielding. “We are closely monitoring the costs and resources required across government, such as procurement costs for PPE and other medical supplies for the health-care system, as well as funds needed by other departments, such as Manitoba Justice and Manitoba Families, to keep facilities safe for the Manitobans who rely on them.”

	The province is tracking all costs and expenses centrally for government departments and other reporting entities, and the premier noted full documentation of these additional funds spent will be provided in the second quarter financial update, nine months sooner than would normally occur.

MANITOBA LEGISLATURE RECALLED TO MOVE FORWARD MANITOBA PROTECTION PLAN
					  Emergency Sitting Required to Ensure Passage of Key Bills to Help Protect Most Vulnerable Manitobans During COVID-19 Pandemic:  Premier


	The Manitoba legislature is being recalled for an emergency sitting today to help expedite up to$1 billion in assistance to fight COVID-19 and protect Manitoba’s most vulnerable through the Manitoba Protection Plan, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Our government is enacting the necessary measures to protect our most valuable service – the front line of our health-care system – and Manitoba’s most vulnerable as we fight this global pandemic together,” said Pallister. “This isn’t about partisanship; this is about doing the right thing to ensure our resources are there where they are needed, when they are needed most.”

	A priority will be updating the province’s borrowing and spending authority to ensure the Manitoba government has sufficient ability to meet unexpected expenditures amidst declining revenues resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the premier noted. This authority is over and above what was presented in Budget 2020.

	The Manitoba government will also be introducing several new bills to support Manitoba’s most vulnerable and advocating for expedited passage of several existing bills to address the growing impacts of COVID-19 on Manitobans.

	“We are taking concrete steps to move forward the Manitoba Protection Plan to help ensure we are doing everything we can to support Manitobans during this unprecedented and difficult time,” said Pallister. “We are demonstrating that Manitoba is Canada’s most resilient province and together, we will get through this.”

	To ensure compliance with current two-metre social distancing measures, during today’s sitting, all parties have agreed to limit attendance to one-third of the 57 members of the legislative assembly. Members will not be seated at their usual desks, but rather be spread throughout the chamber to abide by two-metre social distancing measures.

	The public gallery will remain closed, although Manitoban can observe the sitting at:

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government will now compensate health-care workers who are required to self-isolate for 14 days due to possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Our government recognizes front-line health-care providers are facing extraordinary challenges during this unprecedented time,” said Pallister. “This change will give workers peace of mind knowing they can take the necessary time to protect themselves, their patients, coworkers and the broader community.”

	The Manitoba government will provide health-care staff paid administrative leave for the full 14-day period of asymptomatic self-isolation. Should a worker become symptomatic during self-isolation, the individual will be compensated by sick leave benefits, pursuant to their collective agreement, the premier added.

	The province is also proposing new provisions to the Employment Standards Code that would allow employees to be away from work for specified reasons related to COVID-19.

	After consulting the Labour Management Review Committee, which made a consensus recommendation to provide job protection for employees affected by COVID-19, the province is moving forward with changes that would allow employees protected leave for eligible purposes.

	Employees would be able to take as much unpaid time off work as needed to:
	•    be in isolation or quarantine or take any other control measure in accordance with information or directions related to COVID-19 by health professionals, health officers, Health Links–Info Santé, the government of Manitoba or the Government of Canada, a municipal council or a board of health;
	•    obtain medical examination, supervision or treatment;
	•    comply with an order made under The Emergency Measures Act or The Public Health Act;
	•    provide care or support to a family member as a result of COVID-19, including but not limited to, school and daycare closures; or
	•    comply with travel restrictions.

	The new provisions would apply to any leave that started between March 1, 2020, and a date to be prescribed in regulation, specified once the pandemic is over.

	“We want to reassure Manitobans they won’t lose their job for taking leave to comply with public health orders to self-isolate or to seek medical attention or care for a loved one because of COVID-19,” said Pallister. “We all have a role to play in flattening COVID curve and we are committed to helping Manitobans navigate this challenging and unprecedented time.”

	The provisions also allow for other communicable diseases to be added by regulation to allow the new leave provisions to be re-instated in cases of future epidemics or pandemics.

	The Manitoba government will also be meeting with Manitoba’s public sector union leaders to discuss an ‘all-hands-on-deck’ approach response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The province is seeking ways to defer non-essential spending across all of government to ensure its ability to redirect resources to front-line health services during this critical time, the premier added.

	“Manitobans have every right to expect that their government will do everything it can to address and support our pandemic response and our health-care workers in the front lines,” said Pallister. “We expect that our public service will want to do the right thing to support these efforts and to make sure resources are where they are, when they are needed most.”

	In the coming days and weeks ahead, the province will be exploring and discussing various options to reduce non-essential spending, with the primary focus of mitigating the impact and fallout of COVID-19, the premier stated.

ONLINE AND DISTANCE-LEARNING COURSES EXPANDING FOR STUDENTS THROUGHOUT MANITOBA
					  InformNet Among Growing Platforms and Tools as Teaching Technology Develops and Improves:  Goertzen


	The province has partnered with the Pembina Trails School Division and the St. James-Assiniboia School Division to offer expanded access to InformNet online courses during the suspension of in-school classes due to COVID-19, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.  

	The expansion of InformNet comes as teachers across Manitoba embrace new approaches to teaching using this and various other online and distance-learning tools developed by schools and school divisions.

	“A growing number of teachers in Manitoba will be able to use InformNet course content with their students,” said Goertzen. “This resource offers full online courses and will expand to accommodate as many students as possible while they learn from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

	InformNet is an online high school operated by the Pembina Trails and St. James-Assiniboia school divisions, using the Department of Education’s online learning management system Brightspace by Desire 2 Learn (D2L) Corp. There are 17 courses for students in Grade 11 and Grade 12 now available to teachers across the province. Other courses may be added over time.

	The department is acting as a help desk and offering professional development to support the expansion. Coaching and assistance with applications on InformNet will be offered to teachers through a support team with direct online teaching experience.

	“This is just one of the online systems that allow Manitoba teachers to offer high-quality programs for students to learn and carry on with their studies during the 2019-20 school year,” said Goertzen. “We appreciate the willingness of divisions, schools and teachers to partner in support of a rapid transition to online learning during these unprecedented times.”

	The Department of Education offers 44 other web-based courses on the same Brightspace platform, for a total of 61 online courses available to teachers and students. More than 400 Manitoba teachers have already signed up to use Brightspace.

	In addition, print-based modules are being generated for teachers to use with students who do not have access to technology. The province has formed a working group to further explore strategies for students without Internet access.

	Planning is underway to address the particular needs of French and French immersion teachers and students. There are 12 distance-learning courses available in French and more to be added, the minister said, noting implementation will unfold over the coming weeks.

	The department also hosts the Manitoba Professional Learning Environment (Maple), which provides more than 13,000 educators with a secure space to access curriculum-related supports and resources, to share ideas and to connect with consultants and other teachers. More than 1,200 teachers in Manitoba have joined Maple since in-school classes were suspended last month.

	New groups titled Online and Unplugged: Supporting Student Learning During COVID-19 – Suspended Classes, and Corona-virus: Appuyons nos élèves, partageons nos ressources!, provide teachers with a forum to share resources and ideas for remote student learning. More than 840 educators have joined these groups.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT TO CONNECT BUSINESSES, NON-PROFIT AND CHARITIES TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS IMPACTED BY COVID-19
					  Better Position Manitoba Businesses to Rebound from Pandemic:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government has engaged Manitoba-based business, 24-7 Intouch, to help businesses, not-for-profits and charities facing economic challenges due to COVID-19 connect with support programs, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Manitoba’s small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of our economy and they are facing pressures in ways we’ve never seen before because of the global pandemic,” said Pallister. “We want to help organizations navigate and leverage the resources available to them so they can be in a better position to rebound from the economic challenges brought on by COVID-19, and continue offering services and creating jobs into the future.”

	Pallister estimated more than 65,000 Manitoba businesses are eligible for federal support programs, such as the 75 per cent wage subsidy and Canada Emergency Business Account, which offers interest-free loans up to $40,000.

	The Manitoba government recently issued a request for proposals (RFP) from organizations that could operate a secure call centre to help inform and guide stakeholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. 24-7 Intouch, a Winnipeg-based global leader in the inbound customer-care industry, has been awarded the contract.

	The province is in the process of working with 24-7 Intouch to establish this important service in the coming days. Strict privacy protocols, including the use of personal and business information, will be in place. It will offer bilingual service with the capacity to offer assistance in other languages spoken in Manitoba.

	The premier noted the centre will offer a two-stream process to identify and reach out to identified and prioritized businesses and stakeholders that have been impacted by COVID-19 to offer help, and answer incoming calls and questions. In order to protect the privacy and security of those using this service, outbound calls will not ask for confidential information as their purpose is to advise of the services available and encourage the use the inbound line.

	Details such as call centre phone number and hours of operation will be available in the days ahead. Businesses are encouraged to regularly check the Manitoba government website to view an updated list of available federal and provincial supports at https://manitoba.ca/covid19/business/index.html.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO PRODUCE MANITOBA-DESIGNED MASKS
					  Pursuing Made-in-Manitoba Solution to Enhance Protection for Front-Line Health-Care Providers:  Friesen


	The Manitoba government is looking to the local business community to produce a new Manitoba-designed mask to enhance the supply of the personal protective equipment for front-line health-care workers in the fight against COVID-19, Health Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Our government’s number-one priority is the protection of our most vital service – our health-care system – by ensuring our health-care workers have the protection they need when caring for Manitobans,” said Friesen.  “Medical experts right here in Manitoba have designed a new N95-type mask that is reusable and can provide the necessary protection our front-line workers need.”

	A team of medical experts at Winnipeg’s Health Sciences Centre, led by plastic surgeon Dr. Christian Petropolis, have developed a new type of mask that is reusable and as effective as other, commercially produced N95 masks.  This new made-in-Manitoba mask has a silicone base and uses an N95 or higher grade filter.

	“The mask has a similar design to that of industrial masks.  It is a respirator made of moulded silicone and 3D printed components, and it accepts many available filters as well as a custom-designed reusable filter housing for an N95 or higher disk filter,” explained Petropolis, who is also the program training director for plastic surgery at the University of Manitoba.  “The advantage of this design is its simplicity and flexibility.  The small disk filter uses considerably less N95 material, the main component which has led to a worldwide mask shortage.”

	The province is seeking submissions from local manufacturers who will be able to develop an accelerated process to scale the manufacture of these masks and begin production as soon as possible.  To encourage the mobilization of local manufacturing, the Manitoba government is willing to sign purchase orders totalling up to $15 million to pre-order these innovative, made-in-Manitoba masks.  A portion of these funds may be available in advance to supplement start-up costs.

	“Manitoba is home to an incredible talent bank of innovative thinkers and producers within our manufacturing sector, and I know they will be ready and wanting to step up and help make this happen,” said Friesen.  “With government, medical experts and business working together, we can beat this thing.  I know that together we will continue to find ways to ensure our front-line workers have the protection they need to respond to this public health pandemic.”

	The competition rules and specifications have been made available on www.manitoba.ca/covid19supplies.

STUDENTS AND PARENTS ENCOURAGED TO `E-XPLORE' MANITOBA'S MUSEUMS, WINNIPEG ART GALLERY THROUGH ONLINE TOURS


	Manitoba’s many beloved museums and art galleries have temporarily closed their doors because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but everyone is encouraged to keep enjoying the province’s rich art and cultural experiences by heading online, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox said today.

	 

	“As a mother and a grandmother, I know first-hand how exciting it is to spend time with the family touring the Nonsuch Gallery at the Manitoba Museum or taking a ‘ride’ on one of the vintage tractors at the Manitoba Agricultural Museum,” said Cox. “I applaud the creativity and ingenuity of our museums and art galleries during these challenging times for creating online tours so that Manitobans can safely enjoy all of our wonderful cultural and educational offerings.”

	 

	The Association of Manitoba Museums’ 150 for 150 Exhibit is an online display of 150 artifacts that help tell Manitoba’s stories as part of Canada and before.

	 

	“Museums large and small, rural and urban have contributed to our 150 for 150 online exhibit and it’s something you can explore by yourself or with friends and family,” said Monique Brandt, executive director of Association of Manitoba Museums.  “You can find pictures of artifacts and then ask each other to guess what it is, where it came from, how it was used, etc.  During this time, we’re proud that many museums in Manitoba are offering more online experiences like this to keep people engaged and distracted during self isolation.”

	 

	The exhibit, which coincides with the 150th anniversary of Manitoba becoming a province this year, can be viewed at www.museumsmanitoba.com/150/.

	 

	The Manitoba Museum recently launched ManitobaMuseum@Home, with online experiences at https://manitobamuseum.ca/main/visit/manitobamuseumhome/.

	 

	“Now more than ever we need to stay connected with one another, but in different ways, so until we can see you again, we are bringing the museum to you through ManitobaMuseum@Home,” said Claudette Leclerc.  “ManitobaMuseum@Home is a virtual experience where we’ll share the captivating history of our province, the science that explains our world and the wonders of the universe so that you can enjoy the museum from the comfort of your home.”

	 

	The Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG) is finding new ways to keep the community connected and inspired by launching WAG@Home, which shares art-related content that people can admire from afar, such as My Daily Art, a new series that will share an artwork from the WAG collection every day.

	 

	“Art is one of the most accessible and universal tools we have to learn, communicate and support each other, and in these uncertain and difficult times, the Winnipeg Art Gallery team is looking for ways to help support and uplift Manitobans, every day,” said Stephen Borys, director and CEO.  “We invite everyone to visit our website and social media channels for art-related content that kids, families and adults can enjoy from home.”

	 

	The WAG website, www.wag.ca, also contains Do-It-Yourself videos, hands-on activities and learning opportunities for children and adults.

	 

	Other online cultural offerings include:

	• The Manitoba Agricultural Museum helps immerse visitors in rural Manitoba’s past, providing context to the present and future of agriculture.  The Austin-based museum has an online artifact collection at http://mbagmuseum.ca/collections-exhibits/artifacts-display-filtering.

	• One of the online highlights of the Royal Aviation Museum of Western Canada are the 360-degree cockpit tours that allow the visitor to ‘sit’ in the cockpit or cargo hold of many of the museums aircraft from the comfort of home at: www.royalaviationmuseum.com/virtualcockpits/mobile/index.html.

	• The Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR) has created a new guided virtual tour, and made a number of children’s activities and other content available at ‘Explore the Museum from Home’ at https://humanrights.ca/visit/explore-the-museum-from-home  along with another new feature called ‘Share Your Story’ at https://humanrights.ca/stories/share-your-story#/.

	 

	“I hope everyone will take the opportunity to spend some time visiting online their favourite museum or gallery and also try exploring somewhere new,” said Cox.  “We’re all in this together, Manitoba.”

	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre reports the outflow from the Shellmouth Reservoir will be decreasing to 25 cubic feet per second (cfs) from 800 cfs as part of the normal spring operation.

	 

	This will result in a two-to-three foot decrease on the Assiniboine River levels from the Shellmouth dam to Russell.  The effect of the outflow reduction on the level diminishes as the river flows downstream from Russell to Winnipeg. 

	 

	Citizens are advised to stay off the Assiniboine River and all rivers at this time.

	 

	The province will continue to monitor conditions on the upper Assiniboine River as well as downstream river levels. 

	 

	Use of the rivers, lakes, floodways or drainage ditches for activities such as skiing, sledding and snowmobiling could be hazardous at this time and should be avoided.  People living near waterways should be especially careful to prevent children and pets from wandering onto the ice.

	 

	The quality of river ice within communities is also uncertain, so citizens are advised to stay off rivers and retention ponds.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT ADJUSTS PROVINCIAL PARKS OPERATIONS AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  Mental Health Benefit in Being Able to Connect with the Outdoors:  Pallister


	At the advice of Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer, provincial parks will remain open at this time; however, public facilities located within the parks will be closed to ensure social distancing practices are enforced, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“This pandemic has undoubtedly put significant strain and stress on the lives of many Manitobans,” said Pallister.  “There is a great mental health benefit in being able to escape and connect with nature, and we want to do everything we can to help Manitobans navigate this difficult and unprecedented time.”

	In an effort to maintain as much public access as safely possible, provincial parks will remain open.  However, public facilities including washrooms, playgrounds, picnic and group-shelter use will be closed for the foreseeable future, the premier noted.

	Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer continues to stress that Manitobans need to adhere to social distancing practices and should stay home as much as possible to help flatten the COVID curve.

	“At this time, we believe the general use of parks and trails is a low risk activity for Manitobans,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer.  “With the closure of washrooms and other dedicated gathering space within our provincial parks, the opportunity to congregate in groups of more than 10 people is significantly minimized.”

	The province is not ruling out additional measures or further broader park area closures if social distancing becomes problematic, especially in parks close to urban centres, the premier noted.

	Meantime, the Manitoba government has launched its new, online service for the sale of outdoor licences and permits, the premier announced.  The province recognizes this is a significant change in the way Manitobans will access licences and park permits so it will be phased in, starting with hunting and angling licenses as well as provincial park vehicle permits, which are now available online.

	“While we are in an unprecedented time of social distancing and isolation, we recognize that hunting and fishing are important aspects of daily life for many Manitobans across our beautiful province,” said Pallister.  “This enhanced service with the option to purchase these products online supports our continued effort to ensure the health and well-being of all Manitobans during this global health pandemic.”

	Benefits of using an e-licensing approach include:
	•    access 24 hours a day, seven days a week online or by telephone;   
	•    access through participating retailers (list available online);
	•    the ability to immediately purchase and print licenses and permits at home;
	•    the ability to reprint lost or damaged licenses;
	•    receiving email confirmation of licences/permits purchased; and
	•    improved data collection that will support program management.

	In addition to current base licence fees, an administration fee of $4.50 will be included in all licences and permit purchases to support enhanced service delivery, with the exception of the Manitoba Resident Seniors Conservation Angling Licences that will remain free of charge.

	As the weather warms up, Manitobans are encouraged to embrace the outdoors while practising good social distancing when using parks, trails and other public greenspaces, the premier added.

	For more information on the program, visit www.manitobaelicensing.ca.

MANITOBA PROVIDES UPDATE ON CHILD-CARE OPTIONS FOR FAMILIES DURING COVID-19 RESPONSE
					  Opened Child-Care Facilities are Heroes Helping Heroes:  Stefanson

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is expanding efforts to connect families with child care, ensuring critical services workers and their children can access child care if they absolutely need it during this difficult time, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“Child-care centres and homes that are opening their doors to children and their families during this challenging time are truly heroes helping heroes,” said Stefanson.  “We continue to call on child-care facilities and early childhood educators to be part of our provincewide response to COVID-19.  Together, we can ensure children can continue to learn and grow in a safe, caring environment as their parents go to work helping those most affected by COVID-19.”

	As of today, more than 1,900 children of health-care and other emergency services workers have been matched with an available space by staff within the Department of Families.  These parents include health-care providers, emergency service providers, corrections workers, law enforcement workers, fire and paramedic workers, and direct social services and child protection workers.  Over the next several days, staff will work to match parents remaining on the waitlist for child care before moving toward the new online system.

	Beginning on Tuesday, April 14, all parents who work in critical services, as defined by the chief provincial public health officer, will be eligible to access child-care spaces available in licensed facilities.  This includes support staff at hospitals and clinics, grocery store staff, farmers and farm workers, construction workers, bank or credit union employees.  Starting Friday, parents working in these sectors who have been unable to make other child-care arrangements will be able to go to www.manitoba.ca/covid19 to see which facilities have spaces and work directly with them to secure child care.

	The minister encouraged licensed child-care facilities that want to help by re-opening or continuing to have spaces available to notify the province by submitting an updated facility status form through Manitoba Child Care Online at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/childcare/index.html.

	The full provincial operating grant, over $30 million, continued to flow to all licensed child-care facilities on April 1.  The Government of Canada has also confirmed that child-care centres are eligible for the federal emergency wage subsidy, which provides up to 75 per cent of employee wages for businesses and non-profits.

	“Our government is providing child-care centres and home-based providers with the support they need to continue operating during this difficult time,” said Stefanson.  “We will continue to do what we can to ensure that vital critical services workers can access child care so that they continue working on the front lines of this pandemic.”

	The Manitoba government also launched an $18-million grant program to help early childhood educators begin independently offering child-care services in their homes or in the community, administered by the Winnipeg and Manitoba chambers of commerce.  Early childhood educators can apply for the grant by filling out the Temporary Child Care Service Grant Form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/temporary-child-care-service-grant/.

	Manitoba continues to follow the advice of the chief provincial public health officer, who has advised that licensed child-care centres can continue to provide services to children as long as the care is limited to no more than 16 children per centre.  Some larger centres with segregated rooms and separate external entrances are able to offer care for up to 16 children per room.  Home-based child-care providers can also continue to operate with up to eight children.

	Manitoba has distributed a COVID-19 practice guideline outlining the hygiene and other recommended measures for child care in Manitoba.  In addition, Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, has provided a circular to all centres advising them of infection prevention protocols during this time and will be available to answer questions from child-care centres and providers next week.  The province is also committed to providing child-care providers with additional supplies and equipment to help prevent the spread of the virus as recommended by public health officials, the minister noted.

	Parents are reminded that children experiencing cold or flu symptoms, have travelled in the last 14 days or who have been exposed to others with a confirmed case of COVID-19 cannot be dropped off at a child-care facility and should remain at home.

	All screening for suspected cases of the virus are to be referred to Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) 1-888-315-9257.  The most up-to-date information on COVID19 can be found at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

NEW MEASURES TO ENFORCE PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  Enhanced Ticketing Capacity and Pre-Set Fines will Protect Manitobans, Help Flatten the Curve:  Premier and Mayor

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government and the City of Winnipeg are working in collaboration for an ‘Operation Safe Apart’ pandemic public health enforcement strategy, including new pre-set fines for individuals or business owners who disregard public health orders, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, Premier Brian Pallister and Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman announced today.

	“Everyone has a role to play in reducing the spread of COVID-19, and the majority of Manitobans are adhering to good social distancing practices and changing how they operate at home, in their community and within their business,” said Pallister.  “Unfortunately, there is still a need to have additional measures in place to address situations where people are ignoring the advice of our health experts.  These changes will give enforcement officers more tools to help curb the spread of the virus.”

	In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the province declared a state of emergency on
	March 20, which included orders under The Public Health Act to help reduce the spread of the virus including:
	•    restrictions on public gatherings to 10 or fewer people,
	•    require the closure of non-essential businesses, and
	•    enforcement of social distancing measures by businesses and services that remain open including ensuring a two-metre distance is kept between people in the facility or premises.

	Effective immediately, fine amounts for breaching these emergency orders will be set at $486 for individuals and $2,542 for businesses.

	Manitoba will be implementing a multi-tiered enforcement approach to enforcing orders, which will include public education, written warning or ultimately, enforcement actions such as ticketing or arrest if necessary, the premier said.

	In Winnipeg, the province is working in close collaboration with the City of Winnipeg, which will utilize Community Service Ambassadors to participate in public education and awareness, with bylaw officer and support from the Winnipeg Police Service (WPS) where required.

	“I want to thank all those who are doing their part by staying home, practising physical distancing and respecting the measures put in place by the Manitoba government,” said Bowman.  “While most in our community are doing their part, there are some who are not getting the message.  I hope education and awareness will be sufficient and enforcement won’t be required but in the event it is, these measures will help protect the safety of Winnipeggers.”

	To support these efforts, Manitoba Justice is partnering with City of Winnipeg to create enforcement units, with WPS acting in an assistance role, in ‘Operation Safe Apart’.  These units will be dedicated to enforcing orders along with providing awareness and prevention, responding to complaints and supporting bylaw enforcement officers.

	In Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made by calling: 311 or by email at 311@winnipeg.ca, or Twitter: @cityofwinnipeg.

	Measures involving public health officers working in conjunction with local police services, First Nation police services and the RCMP are also in place for municipalities outside of Winnipeg.  Plans are underway to expand these and adopt measures similar to those announced today for Winnipeg.  These include engaging municipal bylaw officers, community and First Nation safety officers, community volunteer groups such as Citizens on Patrol, and Manitoba Conservation officers who will work with respective police services.

	Outside of Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made to the Manitoba Government Inquiry (MGI) inquiry line at 204-945-3744, (toll-free) at 1-866-626-4862 or by email at mgi@gov.mb.ca.

	“We must to everything we can to protect our most valuable service – our health-care system –and our most vulnerable citizens,” said Pallister.  “These orders will help save lives and changing how we ensure compliance will help us flatten the COVID curve.”

PROVINCE CREATES WEB PORTAL TO SUPPLEMENT HOME LEARNING RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS
					  New Online Resource Will Grow as Educational Materials are Updated and Added:  Goertzen


	The province is providing a supplemental online resource for Manitoba families whose children are learning at home during the suspension of in-school classes because of COVID-19, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	“This web portal, My Learning at Home/Mon Apprentissage Chez Moi, is a comprehensive resource that will be continually updated for families and caregivers as they support students who are carrying on with their school year and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Goertzen.  “This is a tool to supplement learning, but not to replace the impressive, quality work that teachers are continuing to do remotely for students across the province during this public health emergency.”  

	The My Learning at Home portal will go live online today, providing a resource designed to assist families in supporting the work of teachers as they continue to educate students.  Available in English and French as well as for families in French immersion, My Learning at Home will grow over time as more resources are developed for kindergarten through Grade 12.  In addition, supporting materials for adult learners and for early childhood years will be updated regularly.

	“Learning can be done at home using computers and tablets, allowing parents and caregivers to enhance the education of students with family-centred resources,” said Goertzen. “However, teachers remain the primary guide in helping students learn and meet curriculum expectations.  This online portal is another important tool for teaching and learning.”

	Goertzen noted that parents, caregivers and students are encouraged to be curious and to continue seeking out learning resources.

	The My Learning at Home/Mon Apprentissage Chez Moi portal can be found at www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/mylearning/index.html.

	The provincial Department of Education appreciates the continued assistance and collaboration of school division administrators and trustees, principals, teachers and support staff as they all work with families for the benefit of students across Manitoba during the suspension of in-school classes.  Together, they are helping develop ways for Manitoba students to learn at home to complete the 2019-20 school year.

	Meanwhile, the province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer during the pandemic, and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols and the three Ps – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

PROVINCE ADVISES RED RIVER FLOODWAY TO BE ACTIVATED
					  High Water Warning Issued in Red River Valley:  Schuler


	The province has issued a high water warning for the Red River south of Winnipeg and is preparing to activate the Red River Floodway to manage water levels within the city of Winnipeg, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“As Manitoba prepares for the rising waters of the Red River, we are taking measures to protect properties that could potentially be affected by high water,” said Schuler.  “We could activate the Red River Floodway for the first time in 2020 as early as the evening of Thursday, April 9.”

	Schuler noted standard operating procedure for the floodway gates is to wait until the river ice has broken up and cleared upstream of the floodway inlet.  River ice observations indicate the ice is unlikely to clear until April 9 at the earliest and may occur a day or two later, so those levels will be monitored.

	Water from the Red River began to spill into the Red River Floodway naturally on April 7.  The initial operation is the first of several that will roll the gates off the river bed and push more water into the floodway inlet.  The gates will be raised in stages in accordance with Rule 1 of the floodway operating guidelines, which outlines normal spring operation.

	The province has issued a high water warning for the Red River from Emerson to the Red River Floodway inlet, just south of the city of Winnipeg, as the river is close to spilling its banks in most of the region.  A high water watch has been issued for the Red River from Lockport to Netley Creek due to potential of some overland water in low-lying areas due to ice jamming.

	A warning is issued when river or lake levels are exceeding or are expected to exceed flood stage within the next 24 hours, whereas a watch is issued when river or lake levels are approaching and likely to reach flood stage, but unlikely within the next 24 hours.

	The forecast peak flow of Red River at the floodway inlet, without further significant precipitation, is estimated to be between 68,000 and 74,000 cubic feet per second.  The Red River is forecast to reach levels close to 2006 spring levels between Emerson and Letellier, and between 2006 and 2019 spring levels north of Letellier along the river.

	Water levels are expected to peak at Emerson between April 15 and 20 with the peak expected to reach the Red River Floodway between April 19 and 24.  With the operation of the floodway, the Red River level in Winnipeg at James Avenue is expected to peak between 19 and 19.5 feet between April 13 and 17.

	Provincial crews are deployed in a number of communities in the Red River Valley to prepare for potential ring dike closures.  Dike closures are anticipated over the weekend at West Lynn and Noyse.  Partial dike closures may also be required along PR 201 on the east side of Letellier and at St. Jean Baptiste.  

	The minister is reminding property owners to protect wells as high water rolls through the Red River Valley.  If local sandbagging is required, the province has shared suggested safety measures with municipalities for crews to maintain COVID-19 safety procedures that can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/emo/.

	Water levels along the Assiniboine, Souris and Pembina rivers are relatively low with no significant flooding issues.  The Portage Diversion continues to operate to reduce downstream ice-jam impacts.  Small ice jams may occur in Winnipeg at some of the Assiniboine River bridges.  Major lakes in Manitoba are within normal or desirable operating ranges.

	Updated forecast information is available at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/floodinfo/index.html.

	More information for residents is available at www.gov.mb.ca/flooding/health_safety.html and http://www.manitoba.ca/asset_library/en/spring_outlook/wellwater_safety_factsheet.pdf.

PROVINCE CREATES NEW, $5-MILLION FUND FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS RELATED TO COVID-19
					  New Fund to Advance Strides Toward Vaccines and Treatments for Coronavirus:  Friesen

Watch news conference





	A new, $5-million COVID-19 research fund through Research Manitoba was announced today by Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen.

	“This new fund will support a clinical trial to determine if a commonly used drug can safely be used as a treatment for COVID-19,” said Friesen.  “The fund will also provide support for local researchers to develop solutions to health-care issues in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”

	In February, following a recommendation from Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, with numerous partners, launched a funding opportunity for 10 clinical research professionals to test therapies to mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19.

	“This virus is one of the most serious public health emergencies the world has faced in many years,” said Roussin.  “This fund will ensure important research can take place to help fight this virus and develop new ways to identify and treat patients, as well as develop strong partnerships to move this work forward.”

	“We are proud to partner with Research Manitoba on this important work,” said Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler.  “Agile and innovative thinking is what we need in rapidly evolving times such as these, and investments into research and development will help advance our understanding and ability to treat COVID-19.”

	Local clinical and scientific researchers and senior officials from the Manitoba government, Shared Health and the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority (WRHA) have identified several new research projects.  These include projects to test possible treatments in clinical trials, better understand how the disease is developing in Manitoba and better understand how the health system needs to react to different complications that are emerging around the world.

	“We are pleased to refocus our research efforts on vital clinical trials and potential interventions in the fight against COVID-19,” said Tracey Maconachie, chair, Research Manitoba.  “Our world-renowned partners are conducting leading-edge research that could expedite treatments for Manitobans and all Canadians.”

	More than $3.5 million will be used to support clinical and applied research including $700,000 for Manitoba’s first COVID-19 clinical trial for a drug to fight this virus, the minister said.  The study will test whether or not the drug hydroxychloroquine, used to treat rheumatology issues, can prevent people from contracting COVID-19.  The scientific trial will determine if the drug can safely be used as a treatment for COVID-19.

	“We are building on the work of preliminary studies to look at how this drug could help fight the spread of COVID-19,” said Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, associate professor, department of internal medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, University of Manitoba and department of medical oncology and hematology, CancerCare Manitoba.  “We are asking Manitobans who meet the study’s criteria to consider joining this trial to help us scientifically prove the benefits for Manitobans and people around the world.”

	An additional $500,000 will be invested in partnerships with industry and philanthropic sources supporting existing trials based in Manitoba but with sites across Canada and in seven other countries around the world, Friesen said, adding $1 million will be invested in COVID-19 innovation projects including looking at the development of diagnostic tools.

	The minister noted the development of the fund builds on funding for other research opportunities during the pandemic including:
	•    the University of Manitoba investigating how logistical systems can adapt to a pandemic;
	•    developing a cost-effective, point-of-need diagnostic test for COVID-19 at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health; and
	•    developing a COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Manitoba.

	“While we have learned a great deal about this virus in just a few months, there are many more questions that need to be answered,” said Friesen.  “These investments will help contribute to the world’s understanding of the virus and make important strides toward vaccines, treatments and possible changes to our health system to better combat COVID-19.”

	Manitobans who wish to participate in the clinical trial can visit www.covid-19research.ca for additional details.

MANITOBA TO EXTEND SUPPORTS AND SERVICES TO YOUTH AGING OUT OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM


	As part of its COVID-19 response, the Manitoba government is taking steps to extend supports and services to all young adults who would otherwise age out of the Child and Family Services (CFS) system during this difficult time, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“This pandemic is creating uncertainty for all Manitobans including many youth in our child welfare system,” said Stefanson.  “Our government will ensure young people who would otherwise age out of CFS care have access to continued financial and other support when they turn 18, giving them a greater chance of independence and success beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.  We will work with child welfare authorities and agencies to ensure funding and supports are in place to make this possible.”

	The Manitoba government will continue to extend supports to all youth currently in care who turn 18 between March 20 and Sept. 30.  This includes extending foster care placements and ensuring that youth who choose to move out of foster care continue to receive financial support, the minister noted.  

	Many youth exiting care at the age of majority choose to transition to an Agreement with a Young Adult, which provides continued care and maintenance funding, with the purpose of assisting youth to transition to independence.  These agreements are voluntary and available to young adults up to the age of 21.  Individuals who currently have a voluntary agreement in place will continue to receive this assistance over the same timeframe, regardless of their age.

	Over the next six months, this change could benefit more than 280 youth in care and more than 70 young adults with agreements.

	The minister noted Manitoba Housing will also make 10 additional units available to provide stable, secure housing to young adults who are aging out of care and other youth in contact with the child welfare system.  Building on an existing partnership, these units will be set aside for clients of Resource Assistance for Youth.

	“The steps the government has taken today for youth aging out of care will help us protect at-risk young people during this difficult time,” said Kelly Holmes, executive director, Resource Assistance for Youth.  “We are all in this together and we appreciate the timely response from the government during this time of crisis.”

	A number of other changes have been put in place to support children in care and the child welfare system during the COVID-19 response.  Foster home and residential care licenses will be extended for 60 days, to ensure continuation of care.  The province has activated a mutual aid agreement with child welfare authorities, to help ensure staff and supports are available when they are needed.  The province also continues to share current, accurate information about best practices for children, families, care providers and other partners, based on public health advice.

MAJOR MANITOBA 150 CELEBRATIONS PAUSED FOR 2020
					  Public Health of Manitobans is Our Priority:  Premier

Watch news conference





	Due to the significant public health concerns surrounding COVID-19 and large public gatherings, major Manitoba 150 celebrations are being paused for 2020, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“As Manitobans, we all love our beautiful summers and we were looking forward to celebrating Manitoba’s 150th anniversary, but right now, health and safety must come first,” said Pallister.  “We know this is a difficult time for Manitobans, but we will get through this.  We look forward to the days when we can reunite with our friends and neighbours to keep celebrating our great province.”

	This year marks the 150th anniversary of Manitoba joining Confederation and many activities and events to commemorate this significant milestone were planned by the Manitoba 150 Host Committee Inc.

	All remaining events and public activities associated Manitoba 150 are being postponed, but funding will remain in place to support community projects and events when public health advice advises it is once again safe to hold large public gatherings, said Monique LaCoste and Stuart Murray, co-chairs of the Manitoba 150 Host Committee.

	“We invited Manitobans to be ‘United in Celebration’ in 2020 and instead, we are united in the fight against COVID-19,” said Murray. “Manitoba 150 celebrations may be on hold for now, but we know this pandemic will end, and when it does, we’ll be ready with a celebration like no other.”

	The Unite 150 Concert featuring a full slate of Manitoba artists, originally planned for June 27 at the Manitoba Legislative Building, will be rescheduled in 2021.

	“Once it is safe for Manitobans to gather for Unite 150 under the watchful gaze of the Golden Boy, the theme ‘United in Celebration’ will truly take on its full meaning,” Pallister said.

	Questions about Manitoba 150 programming can be emailed to aimee@manitoba150.com.

	Every year, the Manitoba government provides support to nearly 50 community events and major festivals.

	For organizations under the province’s ‘Community Festivals and Events’ program, that must cancel their events this year due to COVID-19, the province is committed to covering up to 50 per cent of eligible funding.

	“Ensuring funding continues to flow will help ensure these Manitoba’s cultural organizations remain viable into the future,” Pallister said.

	Organizations with questions about events and funding should email artsbranch@gov.mb.ca.

STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS SUSPENDED TO LESSEN COST BURDEN DURING PANDEMIC
					  Post-Secondary Students Need Financial Break Amid Economic Difficulties Created by COVID-19:  Eichler


	The province is suspending repayment of Manitoba Student Aid loans for six months to reduce the financial burden on post-secondary students during the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister and Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“During these uncertain times, Manitobans need to pull together to help each other,” said Pallister.  “While people, businesses and organizations across our province co-operate to try to flatten the curve on COVID-19 and reduce its spread, it’s important that our government also do its part to assist those carrying a heavier financial burden during this public health emergency.  With this suspension of loan repayments, we are giving a helping hand to Manitobans who have invested in post-secondary education.”

	Effective April 1, the Department of Economic Development and Training has suspended all repayments of loans under the Manitoba Student Aid Program through Sept. 30.  The temporary stoppage of repayments parallels a similar suspension put in place by the federal government under the Canada Student Loan Program, also through Sept. 30.

	Manitoba Economic Development and Training had been scheduled to receive a total of about $1 million in repayments on April 1 from Manitoba Student Aid borrowers.  The suspension of repayments from April 1 through Sept. 30 will defer the collection of up to $7 million for 2020-21.

	“Manitobans carrying student loan debt have become vulnerable to programming and labour market changes resulting from COVID-19,” said Eichler.  “This deferral of loan repayments is going to significantly lessen the hardship for them, at a time when they really need it.”

	Manitoba Student Aid loan disbursements, including tuition and grant payments, will continue to be made to students as scheduled while repayments are suspended.  During the deferral period, the program will accept payments from borrowers who choose to repay loans through cheque or electronic fund transfers.

	The overall impact of COVID-19 on Manitoba Student Aid will be assessed as the situation evolves.

	Meanwhile, the province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer during the pandemic, and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols and the three Ps – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Public health officials advise 13 additional cases of COVID-19 have been identified as of 9:30 a.m., bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 217.  In addition, a third death has been reported.  Patient specific details are not being released at this time.

	The data also shows:
	•    12 individuals are currently hospitalized, which includes six individuals in intensive care;
	•    21 individuals have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba is three.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 781 tests Monday.  A total of 14,280 tests have been performed since early February.

	Manitobans are reminded to stay home if they can and this includes family gatherings.  While many families get together for Easter or Passover celebrations, people should not let their guard down by gathering this year.  Working together to maintain social distancing and staying at home unless you have to go out are the only ways to slow the spread and flatten the curve of COVID-19.

	Manitobans are reminded to continue seeking care for regular and chronic medical conditions.  Primary care and community health offices continue to be available for those patients in need of care, with virtual (phone and video) options available as well as in-person appointments and walk-in services.

	Assessment clinics for COVID-19 positive patients are also being established.  These sites will offer primary care services on an appointment basis for anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or has respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat or shortness of breath.

	In addition to the primary care space, these locations will also serve as designated testing sites in a separate area at the site to support additional capacity for testing.

	The first Community COVID-19 Testing Site and Assessment Clinic in Winnipeg will open at 9 a.m. Wednesday, April 8 at the St. James Assiniboia Centennial Pool and Fitness Centre at 644 Parkdale St.  When this site opens tomorrow, Access Winnipeg West will once again focus on primary care and community health services, and will no longer be a designated community testing site for COVID 19.

	Testing sites and assessment clinics will NOT be walk-in services.  People seeking testing should still call Health Links–Info Santé first or be referred by their primary care provider.

	Note the Mount Carmel testing site will be CLOSED for the statutory holidays on Good Friday and Easter Sunday this coming weekend.  Visit one of the drive-in sites or the St. James Assiniboia Centennial Pool for testing over the weekend.

	For up-to-date information on community screening sites, visit www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

	Public health is also advising people to remain within or close to their home communities.  This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only.  Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

CANADA'S PREMIERS SUPPORT PROVINCIAL BORROWING INITIATIVE CHAMPIONED BY MANITOBA
					  Fight This Pandemic Together, Come Out Stronger and More United Than Ever:  Pallister

List of Manitoba government COVID-19 Measures
Letter from Premier Pallister
Letter from Council of the Federation

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government’s recent proposal the federal government borrow on behalf of provincial governments and loan that money to provinces as part of a collective financial response to COVID-19 has received the support of all premiers in a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“I am gratified that all my colleagues support this Provincial Borrowing Initiative being placed immediately before the federal government,” said Pallister.  “All provinces are going to be on the hook for billions and billions of dollars in new debt to pay for health care and economic recovery programs.  This is a sensible and available way Ottawa can make it cheaper for all of us to do so now.”

	Pallister has proposed the federal government create a standing credit mechanism on an urgent basis that would borrow on provinces’ behalf and then lend the money back to provinces on the same terms.  Through the Bank of Canada, Ottawa can borrow in international financial markets at a lower interest rate than individual provinces can, saving hundreds of millions of dollars that can be redirected to health care and economic recovery actions.  Section 18(c) of The Bank of Canada Act states: “The Bank may buy and sell securities issued or guaranteed by Canada or any province.”

	As outlined in the March 26, 2020, letter from Manitoba, the COVID-19 pandemic is undermining essential provincial borrowing capacity in many areas of the country.  The limited credits that can be accessed by provinces and territories is generally at rates much higher than those available to the federal government.  This means billions of dollars will be spent on debt servicing rather than on health care and other essential front-line services, the premier noted.

	The Business Council of Manitoba has also written the prime minister expressing its support for the premier’s initiative.

	“The proposed solution provides increased liquidity and flexibility during this crisis while ensuring the greatest value for money during the recovery and moving forward,” said Bram Strain, president and CEO, Business Council of Manitoba.  “This truly levels the playing field for all jurisdictions and sets a foundation for us to begin to move forward, stronger and together.”

	Manitoba and other provinces are going to hit a financial wall requiring borrowing well beyond anything in the past, the premier said.  With every government competing for the same dollars, federal borrowing on behalf of provinces can give us access to greater financial liquidity in the bond markets at a cheaper cost than provinces doing it solely on their own, he added.

	This year alone, Manitoba expects borrowing needs of up to $10 billion, Pallister said.  This is necessary to support front-line COVID health-care and family expenses, fill the holes created by revenue and bill deferrals with the current fall in economic activity, and pay for ongoing expenses of government, he added.  If Manitoba could save 1.5 per cent on these borrowing costs, that translates to $150 million a year that could be redirected to health care.  Over the 30-year term of those bonds, that translates to over $4 billion of savings for Manitobans for this year’s borrowings alone, the premier stated.  Across all Canadian provinces and territories, this could easily translate into over $100 billion of savings.

	“The federal government has been innovative and responsive in dealing with the fallout from COVID-19 on behalf of Canadians,” said Pallister.  “This is another, increasingly urgent way we can adopt a ‘Team Canada’ approach to fight this pandemic together, as we are doing right here in Manitoba with all our partners, to ensure we all come out of this pandemic stronger and more united than ever.”

PROVINCE PROVIDES RECOMMENDED METHODS FOR SAFE SANDBAG PREPARATION
					  Part of Provincial Response to Challenges of COVID-19:  Schuler


	The province is introducing new safe work procedures that municipalities can implement to ensure the safety of high water response workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“This spring, we are potentially facing the unique challenge of fighting a high water event while at the same time slowing the spread of COVID-19,” said Schuler.  “We are rising to that challenge and have developed a creative and innovative solution to ensure sandbagging will be undertaken while keeping Manitobans safe.‎”

	A high water response activity document has been created, which provides a clear and concise process on sandbag production, the construction of two types of sandbag dikes, as well as the installation of water-filled barriers.
	 
	The following precautions can be incorporated into sandbag and water-filled barrier procedures:
	•    social distancing with a minimum of six feet or two metres,
	•    availability of adequate hand-washing and washroom facilities,
	•    regular disinfecting of surfaces,
	•    alteration to work methods,
	•    use of appropriate personal protective equipment,
	•    assurance sick workers self-isolate for 14 days, and
	•    preparation for a number of workers to be sick at the same time.

	At provincial worksites, the province may assign specific duties for regular cleaning of common surfaces, tools and facilities.  A co-ordinated approach with the construction industry, suppliers and consultants is underway to ensure the safety of everyone involved in response efforts.

	“As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, all Manitobans have a role to play in slowing its spread and minimizing its impact on the health-care system as well as in communities across the province,” said Schuler.  “We will work together to ensure everyone involved stays safe.”

	The Manitoba government is announcing new measures in the Manitoba Protection Plan to provide extra support and relief to homeowners and businesses, and to enhance health preparedness for new medical equipment and shelter space in the fight against COVID-19, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Our government’s number one priority during this global pandemic is keeping Manitobans safe and ensuring our health-care system is there for us and our loved ones,” said Pallister.  “We must protect our most valuable service – our health-care system – and protect our most vulnerable people, our senior citizens, our homeless, those faced with threats of violence and those who are facing new financial challenges.”

Faster Health Equipment Procurement

	The government is investing more than $100 million to accelerate the pace at which Manitoba is procuring essential medical supplies and equipment, hotel capacity and other critical needs to help prepare for COVID-19.

	“Manitobans have always risen to the challenge and what we’ve seen so far during this pandemic is no exception,” said Pallister.  “This $100-million investment will allow us to support made-in-Manitoba products and solutions from local businesses to quickly help in our collective efforts to fight COVID-19 and protect Manitobans in the weeks and months ahead.”

	Manitoba manufacturers or businesses that are prepared to rapidly scale up production or re-tool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19 can go to the portal at www.manitoba.ca/covid19, and then visit the business and workplace page.

	The province is also issuing a call to businesses who have a stock of personal protective equipment.  If the equipment is not being used due to closures and physical distancing, they can also reach out by visiting the portal at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.
	 
	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition.  For more info, visit: https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/.

Cash Flow Tax Relief

	Today’s measures will provide immediate relief to Manitobans facing financial challenges by deferring provincial fees and charges, the premier noted.

	As part of the Manitoba Protection Plan, the province is providing the following protections for the next six months until Oct. 1:
	•    instructing Manitoba Hydro, Centra Gas and Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) to not charge interest or penalties in the event that Manitobans are unable to pay at this time;
	•    instructing MPI to relax ordinary practices on policy renewals and collections;
	•    instructing Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries not to charge interest on receivables from restaurants, bars and specialty wine stores;
	•    supporting Workers Compensation Board (WCB) to do the same and asking WCB to extend relief from penalties for late payments;
	•    directing Manitoba Hydro and Centra Gas to not disconnect customers during these times; and
	•    working with municipal partners to ensure municipalities do not charge interest on provincial education taxes and school division fees and the province is encouraging municipalities to do the same with respect to their own taxes and will start discussions to support implementation.

	The government is also deferring provincial income tax and corporate income tax filing deadlines and payments to coincide with the current revised federal deferral of income tax to Aug. 31 and has indicated it would be willing to extend these deferrals until Oct. 1, should the federal government agree, the premier added.

	The new measures are in addition to the recently announced two-month deferral for small businesses that remit up to $10,000 in Manitoba payroll tax or $10,000 in sales tax.  This will result in $80 million in deferred remittance to the province.

	Pallister also announced plans to help make insurance more affordable for Manitobans.  While the province has no ability to allow for deferrals of payments or the waiver of interest charges and penalties, Manitoba is taking steps to make home and business property insurance more affordable to Manitobans by accelerating the removal of $75 million of annual PST from residential and business properties, effective July 1.  

	This will save residential property owners an estimated $38 million per year and business property owners $37 million a year.

Expanded Shelter Capacity  

	The Manitoba government will add more than 140 new shelter beds to support people affected by homelessness and allow for social distancing protocols as part of the province’s broader Manitoba Protection Plan response to COVID-19, the premier announced.

	“While many of us have the capacity to shelter at home, the reality is some of us do not,” said Pallister.  “Through our Manitoba Protection Plan, our government will ensure people who don’t have a stable home have a place to stay safe and healthy as we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic together.”

	Up to $1.2 million will be invested at several locations in Winnipeg to:
	•    repurpose a vacant Manitoba Housing building on Sargent Avenue to create 31 new beds;
	•    add 35 beds provided by the Salvation Army at its Martha Street location;
	•    expand Siloam Mission’s capacity by 50 beds; and
	•    move individuals currently using the Salvation Army’s SonRise Village to alternate locations, making its 26 beds available for new clients.

	The beds at the Sargent Avenue location will be managed by Main Street Project, which is partnering with other shelters to co-ordinate access among their clients.  This location will open today and others will become available as soon as possible.

	The provincial building on Sargent Avenue may also be used as self-isolation units for homeless individuals who need it.

	The premier noted the province is also looking into additional options to support homeless and vulnerable people outside of Winnipeg as part of the province’s Manitoba Protection Plan response to COVID-19.

	“Our government remains committed to looking at every possible way to help all Manitobans through these uncertain times, by providing financial relief and support needed on the front line as we face this global pandemic together.”

	The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols.

PROVINCE ADVISES OUTFLOW FROM SHELLMOUTH RESERVOIR INCREASING


	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre reports the outflow from the Shellmouth Reservoir will be increasing to 800 cubic feet per second (cfs) from 100 cfs as part of the annual reduction from the upper Assiniboine River.

	This will result in a two-to-three foot increase on the Assiniboine River from the Shellmouth to Russell, and one-to-two ft. from Russell to Brandon.  There will be a 0.5-to-one ft. increase as the water reaches Winnipeg in about two weeks.

	The increased outflow will result in potentially hazardous ice conditions from the Shellmouth Reservoir down the Assiniboine River.  Citizens are advised to stay off the river at this time.

	The province will continue to monitor conditions on the upper Assiniboine River as well as downstream river levels.   

	The Hydrologic Forecast Centre is also advising the public of potentially hazardous ice conditions on rivers, lakes and drainage ditches throughout Manitoba as the spring thaw progresses.

	Use of the rivers, lakes, floodways or drainage ditches for activities such as skiing, sledding and snowmobiling could be hazardous at this time and should be avoided.  People living near waterways should be especially careful to prevent children and pets from wandering onto the ice.

	Daily temperatures are warming gradually and are causing ice thickness and strength to deteriorate.  The quality of river ice within communities is also uncertain, so citizens are advised to stay off rivers and retention ponds.

MANITOBA CALLS ON CHILD-CARE PROVIDERS TO HELP OUR HEROES FIGHT COVID-19

	The Manitoba government wants to thank all child-care providers that have stepped up to provide care to the children of health-care and other emergency services workers, and is calling on all child- care providers to help the heroes who are on the front line during the COVID-19 pandemic, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“The early childhood educators and child-care centres that have stepped up to provide child care to health-care and other emergency services workers are truly heroes helping heroes, and I want to thank them for stepping up during this difficult time,” said Stefanson.  “There are still health-care and other emergency services workers who need child care, and today I want to call on child-care providers throughout our province to help those workers as they provide needed services during this pandemic.”

	As of March 31, more than 1,200 children of health-care and other emergency services workers have been matched with an available space.  To support centres so they can re-open during this critical time, the minister noted the first quarter of the provincial operating grant, amounting to nearly $30 million, started flowing to all licensed child-care centres as of April 1.  Licensed child-care facilities that want to help by re-opening or continuing to have spaces available should notify the province by emailing cdcinfo@gov.mb.ca.

	Last month, the government also announced new programs to expand home and community-based child care, including an $18-million grant program to help early childhood educators begin independently offering child-care services at their homes or in the community, administered by the Winnipeg and Manitoba chambers of commerce.  The chambers will also offer business mentorship to early childhood educators looking to open up their homes or other locations in the community to provide child care.  Early childhood educators can apply for the grant by filling out the Temporary Child Care Service Grant Form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/temporary-child-care-service-grant/.

	“It is not too late to step up and help out, whether you are operating in a child-care centre or in your own home,” said Stefanson.  “Our government is providing financial support to child-care centres and early childhood educators during this difficult time, and we will continue to support the child-care sector so that we can help ensure health-care and other emergency services workers can continue working during this pandemic.”

	All child-care centres have also been asked by the province to reimburse parent fees if care has not been provided and to not charge parents to hold spots if they are not being used, the minister added.

	Licensed child-care centres will continue to be limited to 16 spaces to support social distancing and infection prevention measures based on the advice of the chief provincial public health officer.  Some larger centres with segregated rooms and separate external entrances are able to offer care for up to 16 children per room.  This will continue indefinitely in alignment with the decision regarding kindergarten to Grade 12 schools.

	“If you are a front-line health-care or other emergency services worker, we want to hear from you,” said Stefanson.  “Staff will continue working around the clock to ensure that you can get the child care that you need so you can continue working during this pandemic, after which we will be expanding service to all critical services workers as defined by the chief provincial public health officer.”

	Health-care and other emergency services workers can apply for a child-care space by filling out the request form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/GoMCovid19ESW/.  These parents, which include health-care providers, emergency service providers, corrections workers, law enforcement workers, fire and paramedic workers, and direct social services and child protection workers, should submit their request to be matched with a child-care spot by Wednesday, April 8, so that they can be prioritized for placement.  Families that have already submitted a request do not need to complete the form again, as the province is already working to match them with an available space.

	Beginning on Tuesday, April 14, all parents who work in critical services, as defined by the chief provincial public health officer, will be able to access child-care spaces available in licensed facilities.  This includes support staff at hospitals and clinics, grocery store staff, farmers and farm workers, construction workers, bank or credit union employees.  Parents working in these sectors who have been unable to make other child-care arrangements will be able to check which facilities have available spaces at www.manitoba.ca/covid19 and work directly with them to receive a spot.

	The listing of critical services, as authorized under The Public Health Act, is available at:

	Public health officials advise 40 additional cases of COVID-19 have been identified as of 9:30 a.m., bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 167 at this time.

	The data also shows:
	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized including four in intensive care,
	•    11 individuals have recovered from COVID-19, and
	•    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba remains at one.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 1,300 tests Wednesday.  As of April 2, a total of 11,327 tests have been performed.

	Three additional staff across two Manitoba health-care facilities have tested positive for COVID-19.  The confirmed cases, at Health Sciences Centre (HSC) Winnipeg and Betel Home Gimli are being investigated by public health, occupational health and infection prevention and control officials.  All affected health-care workers are being provided with appropriate direction related to self-isolation or self-monitoring, depending on their exposure.

	As a result of the positive COVID-19 case at Betel Home in Gimli, public health officials are also investigating a respiratory illness outbreak among residents there.  Nine residents showing symptoms of respiratory illness are being tested for the cause of their illnesses.  This will include testing for COVID-19.  The home has implemented additional infection prevention and control measures to isolate affected patients.

	A change in protocol will soon require health-care workers working in patient care roles at facilities, including at hospitals, long-term care facilities, health centres, nursing stations, Access Centres and COVID-19 testing locations, to expand their use of procedure masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE).  These changes will be implemented over the coming days at sites across the province.  Manitoba’s provincial COVID-19 central supply chain management is working with regions and facilities to identify and ship appropriate PPE.

	New screening procedures are being implemented for staff working in acute and long-term care facilities.  Implementation of these measures has begun and will involve asking staff about travel history, exposure to COVID-19 positive cases, any symptoms they may have and having their temperature taken at the start of their shift.  Staff who are required to come and go during the course of their shift may be re-screened upon re-entry into facilities and service areas.

	Public health is also advising that people remain within or close to their home communities.  This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only.  Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

	As Manitoba’s health system continues with preparations to ensure it is prepared to meet the needs of patients and to ensure appropriate protection from COVID-19 is available to health-care workers, donations of the following supplies are now welcome:
	•    N95 respirators of various models and sizes, both hospital and industrial grade;
	•    surgical/procedure masks;
	•    gloves;
	•    disposable gowns; and
	•    disinfectants and cleaners.

	Supplies must be in original packaging, clean and in useable condition.  Expired supplies will not be accepted.
	 
	For more information on donating supplies, visit https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/ or call (toll-free) 1-833-408-0101.

	In order to meet continued demands of Winnipeggers for COVID-19 screening, a second community testing drive-thru site will open tomorrow at the Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) Main Street service centre, 1284 Main St.  Hours of operation will be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.

	Other Winnipeg locations include:
	•    Mount Carmel Clinic, 886 Main St.,
	•    Access Winnipeg West, 280 Booth Dr., and
	•    MPI’s Bison Drive Service Centre, 15 Barnes St.

	The new Main Street location will allow testing sites at Access Transcona and Access Fort Garry to stop operating as testing sites tomorrow and return to their mandate of providing primary and episodic care to patients.  The public is reminded that a referral to these testing sites is needed and they are not walk-in clinics.  Information on locations and hours of operation throughout Manitoba is available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES INITIATIVES IN SUPPORT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH
					  Manitoba Government Partnering with Community to Develop Awareness Campaign on Non-Consensual Distribution of Intimate Images:  Minister


	The Manitoba government is introducing new online resources and supports for victims as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox, minister responsible for status of women, announced today.

	“Sexual violence and sexual assault is traumatic and has severe, long-lasting effects for survivors,” said Cox.  “We are committed to ensuring greater supports using all available technologies, such as online, which are more important than ever given the global health situation and the need for Manitobans to stay at home to help flatten the curve.”

	The province will work in partnership with community experts, including the Shameless Circle and the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, to develop public awareness material about the non-consensual distribution of intimate images, the minister said.  

	“During these unprecedented times and higher than usual online connectivity, it is essential that we work together to educate the public on the harm and ongoing trauma associated with the sharing of intimate images,” said Signy Arnason, associate executive director, Canadian Centre for Child Protection.  “As the designated agency to receive and respond to victims impacted by the non-consensual distribution of an intimate image, we are pleased to be working with the province of Manitoba on this important awareness campaign.”

	The Shameless Circle is a volunteer-led healing circle for women aiming to end stigma around women standing up for themselves and their children.
	 
	“Education and awareness is key when it comes to internet safety, for kids and adults alike.  This is why the Shameless Circle team of volunteers are working so hard to combat this particular issue of non consensual distribution of intimate images – this is an important issue that needs to be addressed at all fronts,” Sara Usman, co-founder of the Shameless Circle.  “We look forward to partnering with the Manitoba government on this important initiative.”

	Cox noted the province has also partnered with Ka Ni Kanichihk to develop a brochure about third-party reporting, which will be available on www.gov.mb.ca/youarenotalone/ in the coming months.  Third-party reporting offers adult survivors the option of reporting the details of their cases anonymously to the RCMP or Winnipeg Police Service through a third-party, community-based victim support agency, if they are not ready to participate in a police investigation or become involved in court proceedings.

	In cases that do proceed to court, Manitoba Justice will be launching new testimonial aids for victims, including ‘soft’ rooms with video-conferencing technology that enable remote testimony, the minister said.  These spaces are designed to provide a comfortable, safe environment to testify, which can protect victims against some of the traumatizing impacts of the court process.  They will be located in several Manitoba Justice Victim Services’ offices around the province.

	The province will use social media to share information about available supports and resources throughout the month of April, and Manitobans can participate in the discussion using the hashtags #SAAM2020, #SupportSurvivors and #YouAreNotAlone.

	In addition, the Manitoba government’s You Are Not Alone webpage is updated regularly and Manitobans are encouraged to go to www.gov.mb.ca/youarenotalone/ for more information on available supports, health information, police information and information on consent.

	If you are in need of support, the Sexual Assault Crisis Line can be reached at 204-786-8631 and (toll-free) in Manitoba at 1-888-292-7565.

	Under The Public Health Act, new public health orders announced earlier this week take effect today.  In addition, the chief provincial public health officer has clarified a public health order to ensure a better understanding for businesses classified as not providing critical services and how they are able to operate during the state of emergency.

	All non-exempt businesses may:
	•    continue to operate where customers can order goods online or by telephone; however, customers cannot attend the businesses’ premises or property to order goods;
	•    continue to sell goods to customers where those goods can be picked up ‘curbside’ or delivered to customers; however, customers cannot pick up goods at businesses’ premises or on its property;
	•    allow staff to attend the businesses’ premises, without a limitation on the number of staff, as long as staff take measures to keep social distancing of one to two metres apart from each other; and
	•    accept delivery of goods and may allow services, such as construction, repairs, maintenance and cleaning to occur at their premises and on their property.

	Additional details are available at https://engagemb.ca/.

	Manitoba Justice continues to take steps to reduce the spread of infection and enhance access to justice throughout the province.  As of April 2, new admissions to all adult and youth correctional centres in Manitoba will be handled through the Winnipeg Remand Centre (WRC).  All individuals coming into custody will be isolated for up to 14 days to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 into facilities.  Sheriff services will be assisting rural police agencies with transports whenever possible.  All in-person visits for people in Manitoba’s adult and youth correctional centres have been suspended including inmate programs, staff training and other group activities.

	The province is expanding the number of free phone calls for individuals in custody to help them maintain contact with their support systems.  Lawyers are encouraged to meet with clients remotely, whenever possible, but in-person visits with clients can continue at all facilities, with the exception of the WRC.  Cleaning procedures in all Manitoba’s correctional centres have increased significantly including the use of fogging equipment to disinfect large and high-traffic areas.  Protocols for the use of personal protective equipment are in place to ensure the safety of staff and inmates.

	As of April 2, greater access to bail hearings on evenings and weekends will increase the efficiency of the system, ensure timely bail and other hearings and limit unnecessary admissions to the WRC.  Crown attorneys will work on evenings, overnight and on weekends for consultations and hearings and to work with defence counsel on sentencing recommendations.  The province is also working with police agencies to expand remote bail hearings in the north.  The number of court hearings that can be held by phone will also be increased to avoid unnecessary transportation of people out of their communities.

	Public health is also advising that people remain within or close to their home communities.  This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only.  Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT PERMITTING FORMER NURSES TO PRACTICE DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  Taking Steps to Add Former Registered Nurses to Support Colleagues Under These Extraordinary Circumstances:  Friesen

Background Information

Watch news conference





	Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen is issuing an order under The Regulated Health Professions Act to enable the registrar of the College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba to waive or modify registration requirements for former registered nurses, allowing them to apply for temporary registration during the pandemic on an expedited basis.

	“We know the pandemic will place additional strain on the health-care system, and we’re making this regulatory change to ensure former nurses can be called upon to bolster the number of nurses in our hospitals, personal care homes and clinics to provide services to patients,” said Friesen.  “I want to thank the College of Registered Nurses and their registrants for working with us to make sure we can prepare for the challenges we face and ensure the safe care of Manitoba patients.”

	Former registrants of the college seeking information on temporary registration requirements should visit https://www.crnm.mb.ca/about/covid-19.  In addition, application and registration fees will be waived for former registrants applying for temporary registration via this process.

	“We are thankful for the support of our colleagues in government enabling a more nimble response in Manitoba to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic,” said Katherine Stansfield, CEO and registrar, College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba.  “This is a great opportunity for former registered nurses to continue to make a contribution to the health of Manitobans during this critical time.”

	The minister noted the order will remain in place until there is no longer a serious and immediate threat to public health.

	“We know many former registered nurses have already contacted us offering support to their colleagues during this very difficult time,” said Friesen.  “By coming together and taking the right steps, we can make a real difference and help the health-care system be prepared for the hard work ahead.”

	The minister noted this step builds on other recent investments to support the health system including funding for research opportunities during the pandemic.

	The Manitoba government is investing $800,000 and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) is investing more than $465,000 in three research projects including:
	•    investigating how logistical systems can adapt to a pandemic at the University of Manitoba;
	•    developing a cost-effective, point-of-need diagnostic test for COVID-19 at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health; and
	•    developing a COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Manitoba.

	In addition, the province’s first COVID-19 clinical trial for a drug is underway.  The study will test if a rheumatological drug known as hydroxychloroquine can prevent people from contracting COVID-19.  The scientific trial will determine if the drug can safely be used as a treatment for COVID-19.

PROVINCE RELEASES SECOND 2020 SPRING THAW OUTLOOK


	With the annual spring run-off approaching, the province continues to watch the Red River Valley in anticipation of potential high-water situations, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler said today as he released the second Spring Thaw Outlook of 2020.

	“Our outlook remains similar to the first outlook we released in late February and our focus continues to be on the Red River this spring,” said Schuler.  “Forecasters are expecting a significant inflow of water from the northern United States and they expect high water levels similar to last spring, barring a major early April storm with substantial precipitation or a fast melt.”

	The second Spring Thaw Outlook of 2020 reports the Assiniboine River basin and other rivers are expected to remain mostly in-bank, with possible over-bank high water covering agricultural land at a few locations.

	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre reports with favourable conditions, water levels similar to the spring of 2019 are expected.  Last year, the Red River Floodway was put into service but Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 from Winnipeg south to Emerson remained open.

	Average weather conditions in spring 2020 would result in water levels similar to 2006 on the Red River, according to forecasters.  In that year, PTH 75 was closed for 18 days.  Unfavourable weather could lead to a run-off nearing 2011 levels.  In 2011, PTH 75 was closed for 28 days.

	The minister noted the province has invested nearly $80 million in flood mitigation measures through the Red River Valley over the past four years.  Projects include:
	•    $31 million for raising northbound lanes of PTH 75 south from St. Jean Baptiste to Morris to 2009 flood levels and improving drainage;
	•    $15.5 million for reconstructing the Plum River bridge in the northbound lanes of PTH 75 near St. Jean Baptiste;
	•    $10.3 million for reconstructing the Marsh River bridge on PTH 23 east of Morris;
	•    $4.2 million for reconstructing the Little Morris River bridge on PR 422 near Rosenfeld;  
	•    a $1.3-million project will raise PR 205 in the vicinity of Rosenort and this ongoing project is scheduled for completion in October 2020;
	•    a $1-million project will raise PR 422 in the vicinity of Rosenort, scheduled to be completed in October 2020;
	•    a $8.3-million bridge is under construction over the Aux Marais River on PR 201 with a scheduled completion date of fall 2020;
	•    a $7.8-million concrete culvert replacement project is underway over the Kronsgart Drain on PTH 75 and is expected to be completed by fall 2020; and
	•    a $1-million steel culvert replacement project for the Aubigny Drain on PR 246 is complete and open to traffic.

	The minister noted that considerable provincial resources are involved in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 and officials have contingency plans in place if the approaching spring thaw requires preparations for high water management.  

	The delivery of emergency services continues with appropriate personal protection during this COVID-19 episode and any high water response will be developed with COVID-19 in mind.  Safe work procedures are being finalized to ensure the safety of all response workers and maintain social distancing in producing sandbags and building dikes if required, the minister said.
	 
	“The government has also recently announced the most emergency-ready budget in Manitoba history with additional financial provisions for COVID-19 and any other emergencies we may face,” said Schuler.  “Manitobans have dealt with many emergencies in the past, and we will be prepared for any high-water event that may develop over the coming weeks.”

	The second 2020 Spring Thaw Outlook report will be available at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/floodinfo/index.html.

PROVINCE EASES SPRING ROAD RESTRICTIONS TO AID TRANSPORTATION OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES


	The Manitoba government is easing 2020 Spring Road Restrictions to aid the transportation of essential commodities, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“In order to allow vehicles to more easily transport essential goods during the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are easing spring road restrictions in certain circumstances,” said Schuler.  “This will help ensure communities continue to have access to items such as medical supplies, groceries and emergency equipment at this crucial time.”

	Under normal conditions, spring weight restrictions are enforced on Manitoba’s surfaced roads during the spring.  This protects roads from excessive damage by reducing the axle weights of heavy commercial vehicles during the period when roads are most at risk of weakening under spring rains and thawing.

	Under the revised restrictions, a vehicle may transport essential commodities at normal loading on highways that are subject to Level 1 road restrictions. Additionally, essential commodities may be transported at normal loading on roads subject to Level 2 restrictions, under the following conditions:
	•    If the highway links two points on the vehicle’s itinerary that are less than 10 kilometres apart, or in any other case if the highway is the most direct route between a point on the itinerary and the nearest highway that is not subject to Level 2 road restrictions.  A point on the itinerary means that the vehicle is picking up, or dropping off a load on that Level 2 restricted highway.
	•    If the essential commodities are transported between midnight and noon during the first 14 days of this restriction order, or at any time of the day after the 14th day.

	Vehicles that are travelling empty to pick up essential commodities, or travelling empty after having delivered them, may travel at any time of the day at Level 1 weights on highways that are subject to Level 2 road restrictions, if they comply with the above-noted conditions.

	Essential commodities include groceries, medical supplies, fuel, fertilizer, bulk milk, potable water for non-industrial use, emergency equipment and materials, and mail delivery on behalf of the Canada Post Corporation.  It also includes livestock and livestock feed in transit, and hay for feed in transit within Manitoba.  

	For the 2020 Spring Road Restrictions season, a permit is not required to transport grain to satisfy grain quotas or contracts, or to transport potatoes or vegetables from producer to processor, and these commodities are eligible for the normal loading described above.

	Vehicles are not authorized to travel over a bridge or other structure in excess of posted weight restrictions.

	For complete details on road restrictions, visit www.gov.mb.ca/mit/srr/index.html.

	At the advice of the chief provincial public health officer, Manitoba is suspending classroom learning for kindergarten to Grade 12 students indefinitely for this school year to help ‘flatten the curve’ and reduce the impact of COVID-19 throughout the province, Premier Brian Pallister and Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	“We must do everything we can to flatten the COVID curve and protect the health and well-being of all Manitobans,” said Pallister.  “The decision to suspend classroom learning in school indefinitely for this school year is the easiest decision to make because it protects our children and their education – it is the right thing to do.” 

	The suspension of in-school classes follows the province’s announcement on March 13 that they would be suspended at all kindergarten to Grade 12 schools through April 10.  This new step to extend the suspension is being taken with the interests of students, educators and all Manitobans in mind, the premier noted.

	No student will be held back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but students must actively engage in learning.  All students on track to graduate will do so.  Teachers will teach remotely, assign work, conduct assessments and prepare final report cards.  For students in Grade 12, provincial exams will be cancelled, but teacher assessments will be implemented.  For students in early and middle years, provincial assessments are complete for the current school year, but other assessments will continue.

	“The efforts and success Manitoba teachers and educators have displayed during this public health pandemic have been inspiring,” said Goertzen.  “I join all Manitobans in asking educators to continue doing all they can to use remote and innovative methods to teach students through the remainder of this school year.  Our government is asking for an all-hands-on-deck approach, with their assistance and with that of parents, caregivers, principals, trustees and superintendents for the benefit of all students.”

	Child-care centres located in schools will continue to operate under the current conditions set out by the chief provincial public health officer.  The overall plan is oriented toward the future and we will learn how to modernize education through our response to this situation, Goertzen said.  The combined efforts are geared toward the reopening of classrooms, as well as toward multifaceted ways to teach and to learn after COVID-19, he added.

	The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols, including practising the 3Ps – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

MANITOBA SUPPORTS PROGRAMS FOR AT-RISK YOUTH IN ALTONA
					  Funding will Help Purchase Vehicle for Youth Organization:  Cullen


	The Manitoba government is investing $25,000 to help purchase a new vehicle to support the programs and outreach efforts of Youth for Christ (YFC) Altona, a local organization that works with at-risk youth and their families, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“Many vulnerable and at-risk young people can thrive if given the opportunity to access community-based programs and supports,” said Cullen.  “Our investment will help ensure these young Manitobans will benefit from positive experiences that can help put them on a healthier, more productive path for the rest of their lives.  This approach is one way that our government is building safer communities for us all.”

	Funding will be provided to replace an aging van that is no longer cost-effective to maintain or repair.  The vehicle is expected to be delivered later this spring and will be used to transport young people to hundreds of educational, recreational and employment-related experiences annually.

	“This van is essential in enabling us to reach at-risk youth in our community,” said Sheridan Sawatzky, executive director, YFC Altona.  “It will provide a safe and reliable means of transportation.  More than that, it will ensure that economic and social barriers don’t stand in the way of every young person reaching their full potential.  Offering better opportunities to every young person is essential to the overall health of our community.  We are incredibly blessed and thankful for all the support this project has received.”

	YFC Altona has been active in the community since 1999 and its drop-in centre serves young adults aged 12 to 28.  The application for funding was submitted by Altona Police Service on their behalf, recognizing the positive effect their work can have on community safety.

	“Our youth are our future,” said Chief Perry Batchelor, Altona Police Service.  “It is outstanding that we have an organization in our community where so many people volunteer their time, ensuring that these kids have an opportunity to participate in so many positive events.  The new van will get them there and back safely.”

	This provincial investment is provided through the federal Proceeds of Crime Fund, which is made up of forfeited funds provided to Manitoba from federally prosecuted Criminal Code offences.  The province has also distributed approximately $1.6 million to law enforcement agencies across Manitoba from its Criminal Property Forfeiture Fund this year.  These funds have been used to:
	•    purchase specialized equipment and training for police agencies to improve officer and community safety,
	•    support victims of crime, and  
	•    invest in community organizations leading public safety and crime prevention initiatives.

PROVINCE TO ALLOW SALE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES FOR TAKE OUT AND DELIVERY SERVICE


	The Manitoba government will authorize the sale of liquor with take out and delivery meal service by licensed establishments, Crown Services Minister Jeff Wharton announced today.
	 
	“We have heard from restaurant owners who have expressed a strong interest in selling wine, beer and single-serve beverages through food take out or delivery service, and had already started the process of bringing in necessary changes,” said Wharton.  “These businesses have been significantly impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 and by allowing this flexibility now, restaurants will be able to offer an additional service to customers when it is needed most.”

	The Manitoba government has issued a new public health order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 that prohibits all restaurants and other commercial facilities from serving food to customers in their premises.  However, restaurants and other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or takeout.  

	Enabling licensed establishments to sell liquor with take out and delivery will provide greater opportunities and flexibility for businesses significantly impacted by COVID-19, and more choice and convenience for consumers coping with the pandemic at home, the minister said.

	Liquor delivery and take out orders would be linked to meal orders and offered by licensed establishments whose primary business is food, such as restaurants.  Liquor pricing will be the same as in-dining service menu prices, which will link wine and beer retail to the licensees’ meal service.

	The Manitoba government is issuing a new public health order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of all Manitobans, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“These decisions are not easy ones, but they must be made during this global pandemic to protect the health and safety of all Manitobans,” said Pallister.  “These new orders will ensure critical services are available while taking steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.”

	The chief provincial public health officer is issuing orders under The Public Health Act as approved by the minister of health, seniors and active living.  The following measures will be in place as of 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, April 1:
	•    Public gatherings are limited to no more than 10 people at any indoor or outdoor place or premises.  This includes places of worship, gatherings and family events such as weddings and funerals.  This does not apply to a facility where health care or social services are provided including child-care centres and homeless shelters.  This remains in effect at this time under the previous health order issued on March 27, and will continue when this order comes into effect on April 1.
	•    All restaurants and other commercial facilities that serve food are prohibited from serving food to customers in their premises.  This prevents eat-in dining at all facilities.  However, restaurants and other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or takeout.  If this takes place, the operator of the restaurant must ensure that all people maintain the appropriate social distancing from other customers when picking up food.
	•    All businesses that are not listed in the schedule of critical services that accompanies the order must close between April 1 and April 14.
	    - This closure order does not prevent these businesses from operating on a remote basis.
	    - A business may accept orders on the Internet, or over the phone for delivery or pickup, as long as the employees are not working at the place of business.
	    - The order does not prevent employees or others from coming into the business to perform repairs, to provide security services or to take out items from the business premises if the business is going to operate on a remote basis.
	    - Nothing in the order restricts the operations of delivery of services by the federal or provincial governments or a municipality.
	    - Nothing in the order restricts any activities of a publicly funded agency, organization or authority that delivers or supports government operations or services including health-care services.  This means the order does not affect institutions, agencies and other service providers who provide health-care services such as hospitals, regional health authorities and private agencies who provide a range of health services.
	•    All businesses listed in the schedule of critical services that accompanies the order may continue to operate.  If these business allow members of the public to attend the place of business, the operator of the business must put in place measures to ensure that appropriate social distancing rules are followed.
	•    The order does not affect how members of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba, the College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba, the College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Manitoba or the College of Midwives of Manitoba provide health-care services under the order.  Any other health professionals may continue to practice if they are providing services for a publicly funded agency, such as a government or a regional health authority, or a business listed under the schedule.  In addition, health-care providers can continue to provide emergent or urgent care such as dental surgery.  
	•    Municipal transit services, taxis and other private vehicles for hire can continue to operate.  The operator of the vehicle must take measures to ensure there is a reasonable separation of people in a vehicle.  This order does not contain specific distance restrictions because it is hard to impose a limit in small vehicles.  The goal is to ensure a reasonable level of spacing between people.

	The order also repeals previous orders as of 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, April 1 so there is only one public health order in effect at a time.

	“We are seeing what is happening in other jurisdictions, and the time to act is now.  We must continue to adapt to the situation and change our day-to-day lives to prevent unnecessary illness and further tragedies in Manitoba,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer.  “These measures will help us reduce the risk and protect all Manitobans during the ongoing pandemic.”

	The premier noted that a state of emergency declared by the powers set out in Section 10(1) and 10(2) of The Emergency Measures Act to enable the province to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic remains in effect.

	“Manitobans have always pulled together in a time of crisis and this is no different,” said Pallister.  “We must continue to do whatever we can to support each other.”

	The list of public health orders and the schedule of critical services can be found online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19/soe.html.  Businesses with questions about how the order and schedule of critical services apply to their operations can visit http://engagemb.ca/covid19-csp for up-to-date information, and to ask questions that will be answered by government officials.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES TEMPORARY EXCEPTION TO EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS LAYOFF RULES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  More Flexibility Would Benefit Employers and Employees:  Fielding


	The Manitoba government is adding a temporary exception to employment standards regulations to give employers more time to recall employees laid off as a result of COVID-19, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.
	 
	“The sudden economic impacts of COVID-19 are significant and we are addressing concerns we’ve heard from both employers and the labour force in Manitoba as businesses are forced to close their doors and lay off employees,” said Fielding.  “This measure will provide flexibility to employers to recall employees once work picks up again after this difficult time period and avoid severing their employment.”

	Under current employment standards legislation, employees who have been laid off for eight or more weeks in a 16-week period are deemed to have been terminated and are entitled to wages in lieu of notice.

	After consulting and receiving the support of the Labour Management Review Committee, which includes representatives of both employers and labour organizations, the province is making temporary amendments that would ensure any period of layoff occurring after March 1, 2020, will not be counted toward the period after which a temporary layoff would become a permanent termination.

	“We recognize these unique circumstances may require a longer layoff period than regulation allows, so these amendments would stop the clock until the state of emergency is lifted and keep employers in a position to quickly recall laid-off employees and ramp up business again,” said Fielding.  “We are committed to supporting Manitobans through the COVID-19 pandemic, and we’re taking a balanced approach to help both employers and employees to address economic uncertainty and financial hardship.”

	This measure is temporary and specific to situations where employees will eventually be rehired once the COVID-19 crisis has subsided and economic activity picks up again, said the minister.

	The minister noted the province will also take steps to support workers and will suspend the exception when the province begins to recover economically.  Workers who are temporarily laid off may also have options to access streamlined federal employment benefits at this time.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government will establish five highway checkpoints and provide information in airports to help inform travellers about the public health measures in place to slow the spread of COVID-19, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen and Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“We must do everything we can to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities and on our health-care system,” said Cullen.  “This approach will help ensure travellers know they must self-isolate, what the province’s state of emergency means to them and other important public health information.  By being informed, we can reduce the risk to Manitobans and help keep our communities healthy and safe.”

	Travellers will receive information about Manitoba’s current state of emergency, public health orders issued under The Public Health Act, and the need to immediately self-isolate for 14 days after travel in Canada or internationally.  If Manitobans need assistance with groceries, prescription pickup and other services, they are encouraged to go to www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca.

	Cullen noted this kind of proactive measure to inform travellers and help slow the spread of COVID-19 is critical. 

	Checkpoints will be located at the:
	•    Ontario border:
	      - Trans-Canada Highway East (West Hawk Lake/Falcon Lake);
	•    Saskatchewan border:
	     - Trans-Canada Highway West (west of Kirkella/Elkhorn/Virden);
	     -  PTH 16 (west of Russell);
	     -  PTH 5W (west of Roblin); and
	     -  PTH 2 (west of Sinclair/Reston/Souris).

	“We expect these checkpoints to be operational this week, staffed by provincial employees,” said Schuler.  “Drivers can expect to see roadside signage to help direct them to the checkpoints and support traffic safety.”

	These checkpoints are established under the authority of The Public Health Act.  No one will be denied entry into Manitoba at these locations.

	Signage will also be placed at the Winnipeg Richardson International Airport and the Brandon Municipal Airport to ensure people arriving on domestic flights have similar information.

	The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols including practising following the 3P’s – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Effective March 23, public health officials recommended anyone who returns from international or domestic travel should self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days following their return. This recommendation does not include:
	•    the commercial transportation of goods;
	•    workers who live in a neighbouring jurisdiction and travel to Manitoba for work;
	•    health care workers who travel to work from outside the province; and
	•    normal personal travel in border communities including visits to a cottage.

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is investing in the mental health of Manitobans by introducing a program to help address anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Pandemics bring about a high level of stress and anxiety, and the health and well-being of Manitobans continues to be our priority during this uncertain time,” said Pallister.  “Many of us are feeling concerns over whether we will get sick, the health of our families, the security of our jobs, being isolated from our loved ones and many other variables.  As part of our emergency response to COVID-19, we are introducing an easily accessible virtual option to help support Manitobans.”

	To help Manitobans experiencing mild to moderate anxiety due to COVID-19, the province is partnering with Morneau Shepell, Canada’s leading provider of technology-enabled HR services, to launch an internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) program free of charge to all Manitobans 16 years old and over.  The province will spend $4.5 million to provide these services to Manitobans for up to a year.

	Morneau Shepell launched this digital therapy program last week in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. T he new program is guided by professional therapists and addresses anxiety symptoms related to the uniquely challenging aspects of pandemics: uncertainty, physical isolation, caring for family and community members, information overload and stress management.

	“We know many Canadians are struggling with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health,” said Nigel Branker, president, health and productivity solutions at Morneau Shepell.  “With the requirements to self-isolate and practice physical distancing, we are offering a convenient, digital program that can be accessed with any smartphone or tablet.  Our goal is to facilitate access and provide support to as many people as possible across the country.""

	Morneau Shepell’s national network includes thousands of therapists experienced in dealing with the psychological impact of various traumatic events.  Program participants also have access to live crisis counsellors who are available 24-7 if any risk of harm or crisis is identified.

	The program will be available in English and French in the coming weeks at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Pallister noted this is an additional resource to supplement a number of mental health organizations funded by the Manitoba government.  Existing organizations that provide crisis support via phone, text and video conference will continue to provide support through the pandemic.  

	Lists of organizations are available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/crisis.html  and www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/addictions/index.html.

MANITOBA ANNOUNCES MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN FLOOD PROTECTION WHILE MODERNIZING PROVINCIAL DISASTER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
					  Flood Protection Program Supports Municipalities in Building Future Flood Resiliency:  Squires


	The province will invest nearly $8 million to support more than 80 Manitoba municipalities with enhancing spring flood preparations and protection, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires and Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“Manitobans always rally together in challenging times and while we are facing unprecedented global circumstances, our government is helping municipalities take important steps to enhance flood protection,"" Squires said.  “Municipalities know best what will work for them, and this program is designed to help ensure protection put in place this year will benefit communities for many years to come.”

	Under the 2020 Flood Protection Program, the province offered one-time funding support to municipalities in enhancing municipal capacity for flood preparedness, equipment costs and build resiliency for future floods.  Initially, the one-time program was capped at $3 million, but in light of the need for preparation this spring, the funding will more than double for projects in areas all across Manitoba, the minister said.

	This funding will bring added resources for projects and equipment for the crews who will be working on flood protection in areas all across Manitoba, while boosting economic activity during extraordinary global challenges, the minister noted.

	Proposals were reviewed by a panel made up of representatives from the Association of Manitoba Municipalities (AMM), Winnipeg Metropolitan Region and the Manitoba government.  Evaluation of proposals considered factors including flood risk, ability of the proposal to enhance emergency preparedness or resiliency for future flood events, as well as potential regional benefits.

	Based on applications, the breakdown for funding by district is:
	•    Central District – $1,271,662.07 for 14 municipalities;
	•    Eastern District – $776,451.01 for 10 municipalities;
	•    Interlake District – $1,059.167.70 for 10 municipalities;
	•    Midwestern District – $715,082.41 for nine municipalities;
	•    Northern District – $76,899.00 for two municipalities;
	•    Parkland District –  $759,262.68 for 11 municipalities;
	•    Western District – $1,139,583.73 for 15 municipalities; and
	•    Winnipeg Metropolitan Region – $2,041,770.52 for 13 municipalities.

	“The Association of Manitoba Municipalities commends the provincial government for more than doubling its initial commitment to support the Spring Flood Preparedness program,” said Ralph Groening, president of the AMM.  “As municipalities cannot fight floods alone, these additional dollars further help underscore the importance of the provincial-municipal partnership.”

	“The Winnipeg Metropolitan Region commends the Province of Manitoba for providing support through the 2020 Flood Protection Program in such a timely and direct way, as municipalities are on the front lines in flood fighting across this province.  With an important focus on partnerships and projects that cross jurisdictions, this program will ensure resources are used for the maximum benefit of all Manitobans,"" Colleen Sklar, executive director, Winnipeg Metropolitan Region.

	The funding covers a range of items including generators, pumps, steaming equipment to unclog frozen culverts, utility trailers, equipment for emergency operations centres, sandbags and other small equipment that will assist municipalities in protecting vital infrastructure and reducing flood damage.  These items reflect what municipalities have identified as their priority needs in order to prepare for future flood events.

	Also announced today was a new opportunity for municipalities to set aside funding for disaster mitigation programs in their communities while modernizing the Disaster Financial Assistance (DFA) cost-sharing formula.

	“We have developed an optional program for municipalities to apply to set aside funds dedicated to disaster mitigation and increase the resilience of Manitobans against future disasters,” said Squires.  “If approved, municipalities would be able to redirect funds destined for payments under the provincial/municipal DFA cost-sharing formula to disaster mitigation and preparedness measures.”

	“The existing DFA system is a decade old and needs to be revised,” said Schuler.  “As the scale and scope of disasters increases, governments need to shift their focus to mitigation in order to limit the impact of future disasters, rather than relying on response and recovery.”

	If approved, municipalities would be able to redirect funds destined for payments under the provincial/municipal DFA cost-sharing formula to disaster mitigation and preparedness measures.  This would apply when a DFA program qualifies for federal cost sharing under Canada’s Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA).  In this case, the province would reimburse municipalities for 100 per cent of eligible DFA costs.

	Proposed changes to the Disaster Financial Assistance program will result in municipalities covering the first $3.25 per capita, up from $1 per capita, before the DFA formula applies.

	Further details are available at www.manitobaemo.ca.

PROVINCE CALLS ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR MORE HEALTH-CARE SUPPORT AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  Stronger Banks or Stronger Health Care, the Choice is Clear:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is calling on the federal government to better support health care by lowering borrowing costs, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Manitobans and Canadians are facing a historic pandemic that poses significant public health and economic challenges”, Pallister said. “This is a time to unite, this is a chance for the federal government to help Manitoba and all other provinces obtain the investments needed to secure our public health-care services for all Canadians.”

	All provinces will face significant fiscal challenges in the coming months as revenues decrease and expenses increase.  Most provinces spend nearly half their provincial budgets on health care, and every province needs the liquidity to keep paying their bills, while ensuring the sustainability of services today and well into the future, the premier added.

	“Under the previous government, Manitoba became the most debt ridden province in the country,” Pallister said.  “Over the last four years our government made significant progress to restore the ‘rainy day’ fund to nearly $1 billion for times of emergency, like these. Should the current situation deteriorate further and faster than expected, additional funds will have to be borrowed to shore up our health care system.”

	To address this urgent need, the federal government should immediately establish an emergency credit agency to borrow on the provinces’ behalf. The premier noted the federal government can borrow at a much lower rate than the provinces. This would save Canadians billions of dollars annually that could be better spent supporting health-care and the most vulnerable Canadians.

	“Together, we are facing tremendous challenges,” said Pallister. “Now more than ever, Manitobans deserve a health-care system they can be confident in. The choice is clear, stronger banks, or stronger health care.”

PROVINCE APPEALS TO MANITOBA BUSINESSES TO FIND CREATIVE SUPPLY SOLUTIONS TO HELP CONTAIN COVID-19
					  Engaging Manitoba Industry to Bolster Province's Long-Term Supply:  Friesen

Watch news conference





	The province is reaching out to businesses and their employees for products and supplies to help efforts in the fight against COVID-19, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“The Manitoba government is working to contain and reduce the impact of COVID-19, and we’re taking measures to bolster the health system with help from the private sector,” said Friesen.  “We are soliciting for help to collect the supplies we need in order to guard Manitobans against COVID-19.”

	The minister noted as part of the ongoing battle against COVID-19, the province has, to date, invested emergency spending of almost $64 million in critical goods and services including personal protective equipment, ventilators, intravenous pumps and chest compression systems.

	He also introduced an online portal asking businesses to assist with supplying products and manufacturing what Manitobans need in Manitoba.

	“To help us further our efforts, our government is reaching out to businesses and their employees for products and supplies and those willing to manufacture items from scratch to assist in our efforts in this fight against COVID-19,” Friesen said.  “We recognize that dealing with this pandemic will be a marathon, not a sprint.  Support from Manitoba businesses with additional materials will ensure front-line staff have the equipment they need to protect themselves while continuing to provide exemplary care to patients throughout the province.”

	This initiative will remove barriers allowing Manitoba businesses and manufacturers to redeploy capacity towards the production of essential equipment like ventilators, masks and nasopharyngeal swabs. 

	The province has also intensified the search for 10 chest compression systems, which provide additional safety as the equipment removes one staff member from the room. The equipment will be allocated across the province.

	Products businesses can supply include:
	•    N95 respirators,
	•    surgical/procedure masks,

	Public health officials advise that case numbers and the total number of cases are different because one case was retested and was found to be negative.

	Also note that a probable case previously reported on March 23 of a man in his 50s who lives in Winnipeg with a history of travel should be referenced as case 21.  In addition, a probable case previously reported on March 24 of a man in his 40s who lives in Winnipeg with a travel history under investigation should be referenced as case 22.

	Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential travel.  This includes international travel and travel within Canada.  There should be no recreational, tourist or non-essential personal travel.  In addition, public health officials recommended that effective March 23, anyone who returns from international or domestic travel should self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days following their return.

	This recommendation does not include:
	•    the commercial transportation of goods and services;

	In recognition of the current challenges, the province will defer any increases to the Manitoba Pharmacare deductible that were scheduled to take effect April 1.  The deductible will still come into effect on April 1, but will remain at 2019-20 levels throughout 2020-21 to assist Manitobans with supply limits imposed on pharmacies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  

	Manitobans are reminded that pharmacies have been asked to limit individuals to a 30-day supply of medication.  All Canadian provinces have taken this step to prevent hoarding and ensure there is a consistent supply of medications.

	A new community testing drive-thru site officially opened today in Winkler, at the Winkler Centennial Arena at 600 Park St.  Hours are daily from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.  There are now 12 community testing sites including four drive-thru locations.  The public is reminded that a referral to these sites is needed and they are not walk-in clinics.

MANITOBA TO POSTPONE EVICTION HEARINGS AND FREEZE RENT INCREASES
					  Balanced Approach Protects Manitobans While Ensuring Landlord and Tenant Health and Safety:  Premier

Watch news conference





	As part of the province’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and state of emergency, the Manitoba government will postpone eviction hearings and freeze rent increases, Premier Brian Pallister and Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.
	 
	“Taking these steps will help reduce financial uncertainty and worry for Manitobans who face challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Pallister.  “Manitobans who have been laid off, are working less or are in self isolation shouldn’t also have to worry about making rent payments and keeping a roof over their heads.”

	The province will suspend any rent increases scheduled to take effect on April 1 or later.

	The Residential Tenancies Branch (RTB) and Residential Tenancies Commission (RTC) will postpone all hearings for non-urgent matters to halt evictions.

	Effective today, all scheduled RTB and RTC hearings will be delayed to protect Manitobans from evictions during the pandemic, with certain exceptions to deal with urgent issues that involve the health and safety of tenants.

	The RTB and the RTC will only issue eviction orders to address issues affecting health and safety including unlawful activities.

	Measures to suspend non-urgent eviction hearings are in place until May 31 and will be monitored to determine if additional adjustments are required.

	“This approach balances the need to support renters experiencing economic hardship or who are self-isolating in their unit due to COVID-19 with those safety concerns,” said Fielding.  “The Residential Tenancies Branch remains available to resolve urgent situations involving health and safety for landlords and tenants, which could include a landlord illegally shutting off utilities or locking tenants out of their rental unit, or a landlord dealing with a situation where a tenant is conducting illegal activities from their rental unit.”

	The RTB offices in Winnipeg and Brandon remain open but all clients must make an appointment first.  The Thompson office is temporarily closed.  Landlords and tenants are encouraged to contact the RTB for information by telephone at 204-945-2476 or toll-free at 1-800-782-8403 and by email at rtb@gov.mb.ca If you are a landlord or tenant and require in-person services, contact the RTB to schedule an appointment.
	 
	The RTC remains open, with appropriate social distancing measures in place. The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols, including practising following the 3P’s – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.

	The public is reminded that visitor access at hospitals has been suspended.  Exceptions for compassionate and end-of-life reasons will continue to be made on a case-by-case basis and visitors will be appropriately screened for travel, symptoms and exposure to COVID-19.  For labour and delivery as well as pediatric patients, one visitor continues to be allowed, with the same stringent screening in place.

	Visitor access at long-term care facilities is also subject to significant restrictions, which will now include screening for visitors who have returned from travel outside the province in the last 14 days.  These measures are in place to protect patients, residents and staff.

PROVINCE LAUNCHES ONLINE TOOL TO CONNECT VOLUNTEERS SAFELY WITH MANITOBANS NEEDING ASSISTANCE
					  Made-in-Manitoba Website Application Demonstrates Teamwork, Technological Innovation, Community Spirit:  Premier

Watch news conference





	The generosity and innovation of Manitobans to help those in need of assistance is displayed in the new web application www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca, Premier Brian Pallister announced today immediately after the online tool went live.

	“This new online tool captures the spirit of our province, where Manitobans in communities across our province can always be counted on to step up to assist others who need help, especially in times of need,” said Pallister.  “The innovative tool, created by Manitobans for Manitobans, puts people all over the province who need assistance easily in contact with those nearby – while adhering to social distancing protocols – who want to help them.”

	The premier said www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca is an important initiative for the Manitoba government, safely matching volunteer and community support to needs for goods and services such as groceries, medication, snow-clearing and various other necessities. Residents in greatest need, such as the elderly, disabled and those at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during the current global pandemic, will find the application very useful, he noted.

	Built by Manitobans for Manitobans, the provincewide online platform was quickly designed and developed by North Forge Technology Exchange, a non-profit and team-led Winnipeg technology organization, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  North Forge collaborated with others in the community, resulting in development of the app – the first online service of its kind in Canada – within five days.

	“There are a lot of amazing people out there creating volunteer platforms, but we wanted to ensure that security and safety are embedded to protect our citizens”, Joelle Foster, CEO, North Forge Technology Exchange. “As such, we turned to our community of innovators and we are so pleased that software development partners like Permission Click and ID Fusion Software stepped up to collaborate with us and have built this tool in record time.""

	The online tool www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca will be vital for requests ranging from home computer and data security assistance to prescription medication pickups and deliveries.  Manitobans can access www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca directly or via www.Manitoba.ca/COVID19.

	“This is how Manitobans pull together, put their heads together and bring ideas to life to assist each other when help is needed,” said Pallister.  “Manitoba has been the home of hope for over 150 years, and we will continue to be the home of hope for generations to come.  We will get through this pandemic together.

	The premier added the province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols, including practising following the 3P’s – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.

	Public health officials advise an additional probable case of COVID-19 has been identified, while another case initially identified as probable has been ruled out.  That case will be removed from the list, meaning the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba remains at 20.

	The newest probable positive case is a man in his 50s who lives in Winnipeg.  At this time, the public health investigation indicates the case is related to travel.  Information about flights where a person with a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 had symptoms at the time of travel are updated as information becomes available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/flights.html.

	Health officials are reminding physicians, health-care providers and support staff returning from travel they MUST self-identify to their organization/site’s occupational health services.

	Research Manitoba is working with the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) to invest in the Canadian 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Rapid Research Funding Opportunity.  The Manitoba government is investing $800,000 and the CIHR is investing more than $465,000 in three research projects including:
	•    investigating how logistical systems can adapt to a pandemic at the University of Manitoba;
	•    developing a cost-effective, point-of-need diagnostic test for COVID-19 at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health; and
	•    developing a COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Manitoba.

	In an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and keep in-home health-care providers and our communities safe, new screening steps will be undertaken in advance of home and community visits.  Health-care providers are contacting clients to complete screening in advance of normal appointments.  Wherever possible, this screening will occur over the phone but may also be conducted from an appropriate social distance (two metres or six feet) before entry to the home.  Screening is intended to identify potential for exposure to COVID-19 within the household, and identify whether services may safely be postponed or offered in another way such as over the phone.

	For visits that must occur in person as scheduled, providers will use appropriate personal protective equipment and follow proper hand hygiene protocols.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

	Eleven community testing sites throughout the province are open.  The public is reminded that a referral to these sites is needed and they are not walk-in clinics.  Information on locations and hours of operation are available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT EXTENDS TAX PAYMENT FILING DEADLINES FOR BUSINESSES
					  Extension Could Help More Than 20,000 Manitoba Businesses Cope with Impacts of COVID-19:  Pallister


	The province is extending tax filing deadlines for businesses impacted by COVID-19, Premier Brian Pallister and Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	 

	“Manitoba businesses are facing a challenging economic situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and we want to help them out by giving them more time to submit provincial taxes,” said Pallister.  “Some businesses may need access to these extra funds and we want to provide them with that flexibility.  The allowance is one of several measures our government has introduced to help Manitobans cope during this trying and uncertain time.”

	 

	The province will extend the April and May filing deadlines for small and medium-sized businesses with monthly remittances of no more than $10,000.  It is estimated this could help more than 20,000 businesses in Manitoba, the premier noted.  Businesses will have up to two additional months to remit retail sales taxes and the Health and Post Secondary Education Tax Levy, commonly called the payroll tax.

	 

	“This extension gives small and medium businesses a two month breather to deal with COVID-19,” said Fielding.  “This global pandemic is impacting all Manitobans and while we focus our resources and energy on the health of Manitobans, we must be mindful of the financial toll the pandemic is having on businesses and families.  Over 95 per cent of Manitoba business are small or medium sized, and they need government support through this difficult time.”

	 

	The minister noted the department will work with businesses regarding flexible repayment options above the $10,000 cap.

	 

	Further information regarding filing requirements will be available Monday on the Manitoba Tax Publications page on the Finance Taxation website at www.gov.mb.ca/finance/taxation/bulletins.html.

	•    limit public gatherings to less than 50 people including places of worship, family events, weddings and funerals;
	•    require retailers to ensure separation of two metres between patrons in their facility;
	•    limit hospitality premises such as restaurants or theatres to 50 people, or 50 per cent of capacity (whichever is less); and
	•    immediate closure of bingo and gaming centres, as well as wellness centres such as gyms and fitness centres.

	At this time, the public health orders apply to public places, not workplaces.  However, workplaces should still follow good social distancing practices as recommended by public health including:
	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two meters/six feet) contact between other individuals in public;
	•    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;
	•    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;
	•    staying home if you are sick;
	•    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill with the virus; and
	•    cancelling travel and avoiding crowded places and events, especially if you are at higher risk (e.g. seniors and those with underlying medical conditions).

	The online screening tool is now available in an interactive voice response (IVR) format.  It is not a replacement for Health Links–Info Santé.  It is specifically for Manitobans who prefer to complete the screening tool by phone rather than online.

	The tool asks callers standard screening questions for COVID-19.  If needed, it directs those who may require a conversation with a health-care professional to Health Links–Info Santé.  People who want to self-screen can call (toll-free) 1-877-308-9038.

	A new community screening drive-thru site has opened in south Winnipeg at the Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) Bison Drive Service Centre.  MPI employees vacated the premises, located at 15 Barnes St., earlier this week to make way for the testing site. 

	Hours for the site, Manitoba’s 11th testing location and third drive-thru, are daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Information on other sites is available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 before arriving at a testing site.

MANITOBA IMPLEMENTING $27.6-MILLION PLAN TO SUPPORT CHILD CARE FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS


	The Manitoba government is investing $27.6 million to help provide child care to essential front-line workers who need it as they support the province’s COVID-19 response, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“This pandemic requires all Manitobans to change how they live their daily lives, but it is clear that we are all willing to work together to find solutions,” said Stefanson.  “Our government is following through on our commitment to parents who must provide essential front-line health and other services and who need help securing child care.  In this time of uncertainty and challenge, we are working in partnership with child-care providers to find creative solutions in the community.”

	To ensure dedicated child-care spaces are available and prioritized for health-care and other essential front-line workers while also following public health recommendations for social distancing, the Manitoba government will:
	•    establish a new $18-million grant program to help early childhood educators affected by the suspension of child-care services in centres to have access to immediate funds to begin independently offering child-care services at their homes or in the community;
	•    continue to provide licensed child-care centres with their full operating grants and subsidies, totaling up to $7.6 million provincewide, so that they can provide care for up to 16 children with first priority given to children of health-care and other essential workers;
	•    invest $2 million to create a trust that will provide capital grants to child-care providers to ensure safe, quality care; and
	•    encourage all centres to reimburse prepaid fees to parents for child care they can no longer access during this difficult time.

	“Manitoba’s child-care providers have clearly demonstrated their dedication, caring and willingness to work together as we respond to an unprecedented situation,” said Stefanson.  “Our government is taking concrete, immediate steps to help ensure child-care options continue to be available when they are needed most.”

	The province is partnering with the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce and the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce to administer the $18-million grant program.  Further details, including on how to apply, will be available online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.  Eligible early childhood educators would each receive up to $3,000 to provide care to children at their homes or at other appropriate spaces.  Early childhood educators would also be able to individually apply for the grants and to choose to work together to provide care in the community for up to a maximum of 12 children.

	The $2-million fund will be administered by The Winnipeg Foundation and will provide grants to child-care providers with 16 or fewer children and to home-based providers with 12 or fewer children.  The grants can be used to purchase supplies for meeting health and safety requirements, such as a fire extinguisher or first aid kits, or to undertake minor upgrades to physical spaces or to provide quality learning and care items such as high chairs, mats or books.

	Further information on all of these programs will be provided online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.
	 
	The Manitoba government recommends that all parents continue to try to make their own alternate arrangements for child care.  These interim options should be used only when parents cannot make other child-care plans.  Parents who use these options will continue to pay daily parent fees.

	Child-care centres are expected to reimburse or offer credits on parent fees that have been collected for dates when care will no longer be offered.  Unless care is being provided, parent fees should no longer be charged as of April 1.

	Essential, front-line workers who need child-care options should call 204-945-0776 or (toll-free) 1-888-213-4754, or e-mail cdcinfo@gov.mb.ca.  All questions about the new funding programs available to child-care centres and early childhood educators should be sent to ecegrant@gov.mb.ca.

	Manitobans are reminded to visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19 for more information on COVID-19 and for updates on the province’s response.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC, REDUCE SPREAD OF COVID-19
					  Focus Solely on Health and Safety of all Manitobans:  Premier


	The Manitoba government is declaring a provincewide state of emergency under The Emergency Measures Act to protect the health and safety of all Manitobans and reduce the spread of COVID-19, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“This decision was not made lightly.  However, we must continue to use every tool available to ‘flatten the curve’ and reduce the spread of COVID-19 on our communities and our health-care system,” said Pallister.  “Our government is focused solely on the health and safety of all Manitobans.  This move will enable us to react more quickly on a broad range of supportive measures to stop the spread for COVID-19 and ensure that essential services are available for all Manitobans during this global health pandemic.”

	A state of emergency has been declared by the powers set out in Section 10(1) and 10(2) of The Emergency Measures Act to enable the province to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, the chief provincial public health officer is issuing orders under The Public Health Act as approved by the minister of health, seniors and active living.

	“With this declaration, the biggest roles for all Manitobans to play right now, is to protect yourself, your family, your friends and your community,"" said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer.  “I cannot emphasize this enough – this is the time for action.  We must change our day-to-day lives, and think about your role in protecting ourselves and all Manitobans.”

	As authorized under The Public Health Act, the following measures will be in place, effective immediately, for a period of 30 days:
	1.    Limiting public gatherings of more than 50 people at any indoor or outdoor place or premises.  This includes places of worship, gatherings and family events such as weddings and funerals.  This does not apply to a facility where health care or social services are provided.  Retail businesses including grocery or food stores, shopping centres, pharmacies or gas stations must ensure separation of one to two metres between patrons assembling in the business.  Public transportation facilities must also ensure that people assembling at the facility are reasonably able to maintain a separation of one to two metres from others assembling at the facility.
	2.    Limiting hospitality premises where food or alcohol is served or any theatres offering live performances of music, dance and other art forms as movies theatres to 50 people or 50 per cent of the capacity of the premises, whichever is lesser.  These establishments must be able to ensure social distance of one to two metres between customers.
	3.    Immediate closures of all bingo and gaming events.
	4.    Immediate closure of all wellness centres offering physical activities, gyms, fitness centres and athletic clubs and training facilities

	“This is a time to support our friends, families and communities,” said Pallister.  “The situation is constantly evolving and changing rapidly.  Enacting a state of emergency will further our province’s ability to be nimble, act swiftly and support Manitobans when they need it most.”

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT INTRODUCES COVID-19 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENT TO BUDGET 2020
					  Most Emergency-Ready Budget in Manitoba History:  Fielding


	The Manitoba government is tabling a supplementary document that will outline measures in Budget 2020 to address the COVID-19 pandemic, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“Budget 2020 takes measures that serve as the foundation for the Manitoba government’s fiscal response to the fast-evolving public health and economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Fielding.  “Budget 2020 sets aside the largest amount of money in Manitoba history for emergency expenditures, and Manitobans should be reassured by this unprecedented level of fiscal resilience and flexibility to quickly deliver the resources required to respond to any emergency.”

	The province is taking significant financial and public health steps to ensure Manitobans are safe and protected at this time of rising economic and social anxiety, noted the minister.

	The budget supplement outlined key measures that contribute to Manitoba’s resiliency:
	•    reinvestment in the rainy day fund – over the coming month, the province will increase the Fiscal Stabilization Fund to $800 million from $571 million, and transfer an additional $72 million by the end of the 2020-21 fiscal year;
	•    prudent budgeting – the province has avoided $10 billion in debt over the past four years as a result of responsible financial decisions, as well as approximately $200 million of incremental interest costs;
	•    federal support – $18 million in federal support is available to Manitoba and Ottawa has indicated further aid is likely forthcoming; and
	•    a stable, resilient economy – with Manitoba’s diversified economic base, the province continues to have one of the most competitive and stable economies in Canada.  

	Overall, Manitoba has nearly $1 billion of financial flexibility to address this challenge, if required, the minister noted.

	“The steps our government has taken over the past four years to manage provincial finances more responsibly means that we are better positioned to respond to this and future emergencies and withstand the ongoing period of economic uncertainty,” said Fielding.  “Living in a province that regularly faces floods and other natural disasters has taught us the importance of being prepared for emergencies and having flexibility and agility in our planning and response.”

	Fielding noted the province is making the necessary investments to address the pandemic and implementing protocols to ensure funds are available in order to quickly respond to the rapidly changing situation.

	The COVID-19 response will also impact Manitoba’s forecasted budgetary revenues for the 2020-21 fiscal year, the minister said.  Preliminary estimates for Manitoba’s economy suggest a large initial decline in economic growth during the first half of 2020, followed by a recovery in the second half of the year.  Growth in 2021 may be higher than currently forecast as a result of the return of pent-up demand across impacted sectors, he noted.  The Budget 2020 supplement states that there are reasons to believe Manitoba will see a less significant decline than other jurisdictions, in part, given the province’s diversified economic base.

	The government’s 2019-20 third quarter fiscal update released in early March projected a $325-million deficit for the current fiscal year.  The province does not anticipate significant impacts that would disrupt that forecast.

	The Manitoba government will update its projections as the situation unfolds over the coming months.  Government departments continue to engage closely with key provincial stakeholders and other governments to mitigate the economic and public health challenges of this significant event, Fielding said.

	Visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19 for the most up-to date information on COVID-19.

	The COVID-19 Emergency Supplement to Budget 2020 will be posted with the rest of the budget documents at www.manitoba.ca/budget2020.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	Budget 2020 continues moving Manitoba forward and building a brighter future for all Manitobans, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today as he presented the provincial budget in the Manitoba legislature.

	“In just four years, Manitoba has made tremendous progress on the road to recovery,” said Fielding.  “Budget 2020 continues the hard work by focusing on the issues that matter most to Manitobans – by providing better services, protecting our environment, making our communities stronger and safer, making life more affordable, and building a better, brighter and more prosperous future for all Manitobans and their families.”

	The province is introducing a made-in-Manitoba Green Levy effective July 1 at a flat $25 per tonne that will not increase each year, unlike the federal government’s carbon tax.  The minister noted it will cost Manitoba families and businesses less than the federal carbon tax plan and will be more effective in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.  In order to offset the impact of the Green Levy, the government will lower the PST rate to six per cent as of July 1.

	“Budget 2020 delivers significant tax reductions which, combined with the 2019 tax cuts, are the largest in Manitoba history.  Manitoba will be the only province that has cut its sales tax in recent years and we’ve done it twice,” said Fielding.  “This PST rate reduction will ensure that all who pay the Green Levy will benefit through a lower sales tax rate.”

	Combined with last year’s PST rate reduction to seven per cent, Fielding estimated this additional reduction and implementation of the Green Levy will grow the provincial nominal GDP by $108 million, which is good for the environment and good for the economy.  It will increase labour income by an estimated $50 million annually and generate an estimated 1,042 person-years of employment growth.

	The PST reduction is expected to create an average annual savings of approximately $345 per household, with approximately 510,000 households in Manitoba.  Combined with an additional $131 in savings estimated to be passed along by Manitoba businesses, it results in total average savings of $476 per year to Manitoba households.

	The province will replenish the rainy day fund and will contribute an additional $300 million to the fund by the end of 2020-21.  This will result in a balance of $872 million, at which point the rainy day fund will be fully funded.

	“Our province will be in a far stronger position to respond to unforeseen emergencies and we have never been as prepared to deal with those situations,” said Fielding.  “While the previous government left Manitoba without the resources to respond to natural disasters, our government is replenishing the rainy day fund.”

	Additionally, the emergency expenditures contingency is increased to $100 million, which is effectively $86 million higher than it was in 2016, and an incremental $45 million available for infrastructure projects aimed at improving environmental resiliency.  The government is determined to complete the Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin Outlet Channels Project as soon as possible and Budget 2020 allocates a total of $101 million for the important flood mitigation initiative.

	The expected provincial deficit for Budget 2020 has been reduced to $220 million, an improvement of $140 million over the previous year.  Fielding also reconfirmed the government is on track to balance the budget within its current term.  Importantly, the province is also forecasting that its debt-to-GDP ratios will be declining over the next four years, which is a significant signal of improving fiscal health, the minister noted.

	“Supported by strong revenue growth and responsible expenditure controls, we are now one step closer to delivering a balanced budget during the current term of government,” said Fielding.  “We have modestly exceeded our plans each year and we are predicting, for the fourth year in a row, an improvement to our earlier forecasts.  We have reduced the deficit each year, while making record investments in health, in education and for families.  We have made life more affordable for Manitobans by cutting the retail sales tax rate, by ending income tax bracket creep and by eliminating many other fees.”

	Budget 2020 provides record investments in health care at $6.8 billion and education with $1.3 billion in operating grants to public school divisions.  The Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living budget includes funding for a range of capital projects, such as the Health Sciences Centre master campus plan and St. Boniface Hospital redevelopment, with a total strategic infrastructure budget of $1.8 billion.  A $160-million investment on capital projects in the kindergarten to Grade 12 education system will result in 4,425 new classroom spaces either open or under construction by the end of the 2020-21 fiscal year as the government builds seven new schools and several major additions and renovation projects.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	Public health officials advise the number of lab-confirmed positive and presumptive positive cases in Manitoba remains at 17 at this time.

	Public health investigations are continuing on the two additional positive cases identified yesterday.  It appears that both cases are related to travel.

	In an effort to protect patients, staff and the community, all Manitoba health-care facilities will soon begin implementing enhanced precautions and protocols which will involve additional visitor restrictions.  Exceptions for compassionate reasons will continue to be made on a case-by-case basis.

	This step follows public health’s recommendation earlier this week to suspend visitor access to long-term-care facilities across the province.  Similar to health-care facilities, exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of individual facility managers.

	Preparations continue to ensure acute care facilities are prepared in the event of COVID-19 patients requiring admissions.  Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg (HSC) has begun a series of moves as part of the provincially co-ordinated response.  A medicine unit will today be relocated to existing clinical space in the former HSC Women’s Pavilion at 735 Notre Dame Ave. to enable the movement of patients within the hospital campus to create a 30-bed isolation unit.

	Twenty-seven additional ventilators, which are crucial to caring for critically ill patients, have arrived and will be put into operation at health-care facilities throughout the province.  This brings Manitoba’s overall supply to 266.  It is anticipated an additional 16 ventilators, also ordered last week, will be delivered in the coming weeks.

	Agencies that offer day programs through Community Living disABILITY Services for adults with intellectual disabilities have been asked to limit this service as part of the effort to support social distancing efforts and reduce the potential spread of the virus.  As soon as possible, day services will only be offered to individuals who:
	•    live with family members who could lose their job if day services are not provided,
	•    are supported by home share providers who can’t provide care during daytime hours and where other arrangements are not possible, and
	•    cannot be safely supported in their residence during daytime hours.

	Clients and their family members or care providers will receive further information as soon as possible.

	Manitoba now has nine dedicated testing sites for COVID-19.  There are four sites in Winnipeg, as well as locations in Brandon, Thompson, Flin Flon, The Pas and Selkirk.  Additional locations are expected to open in the coming days including drive-thru locations in Winnipeg and Steinbach.  The new drive-thru in Winnipeg will open in the coming days at the Manitoba Public Insurance Bison Drive Service Centre at 15 Barnes St. (intersection of Barnes Street and Bison Drive) in south Winnipeg, while the Steinbach location will open tomorrow morning at the Community Health Services Building at 365 Reimer Ave.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 before arriving at a testing site.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	Public health officials advise that two additional presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Manitoba.  This brings the total number of lab-confirmed positive and presumptive positive cases in Manitoba to 17.

	Case information includes:
	•    case 16 is a woman in her 50s who lives in Winnipeg; and
	•    case 17 is a man in his 70s who lives in Winnipeg.

	Public health investigations have begun and at this time, it appears that both cases are travel related.

	Manitoba’s first drive-thru community testing site for COVID-19 opened this afternoon in Selkirk.  The new site will see patients referred to the site drive up to be screened by health-care workers.  If necessary, they will be registered, tested and given advice on what to do while awaiting results without leaving their vehicle.  The Selkirk testing site, at 622 Superior Ave., will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  It is the ninth dedicated testing site to open in Manitoba in the past week.  There are four sites in Winnipeg, as well as locations in Brandon, Thompson, Flin Flon and The Pas.

	These testing sites are by referral only and are not walk-in clinics.  Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 before arriving at a testing site.

	CancerCare Manitoba is taking proactive measures to help reduce the impact of COVID-19.  Starting Thursday, breast cancer screening services at BreastCheck will be suspended for at least two weeks.  Clients will be notified directly to confirm that their appointments will be affected.  Clients can call (toll-free) 1-855-95-CHECK (24325) if they have any questions or concerns.

	All hemodialysis patients need to continue to go for dialysis treatments.  Hospitals and dialysis units are implementing many measures to ensure all hemodialysis patients are provided the safest care.  Dialysis treatments are life sustaining and going to a hospital for regularly scheduled dialysis treatments in a carefully managed environment is the SAFEST option for hemodialysis patients.

	Patients who skip or miss dialysis treatments may have adverse health outcomes and require emergency medical services such as urgent care or emergency department care.  Dialysis patients who have travelled internationally in the past 14 days or who experience flu-like symptoms should still call Health Links-Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 and their dialysis unit before going to the dialysis unit or hospital.

	Starting tomorrow, Employment and Income Assistance (EIA) clients are asked to contact staff through the call centre whenever possible, in order to follow public health recommendations on public distancing.  Phone lines are open Monday to Friday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 204-948-2888 (inside Winnipeg) or 1-855-944-8111 (toll-free, outside Winnipeg).  Clients can also email the department at eia@gov.mb.ca.  All EIA offices are still open during normal business hours (Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.) but it is recommended clients use phone or email options and avoid in-person visits.

	In light of recommendations about social distancing and limiting public gatherings, Manitoba Conservation and Climate has cancelled all planned interpreter-led events in Manitoba parks and has closed interpretive centres until further notice.  Parks remain open for day use at this time.  As long as people are healthy and able to do so, they can explore trails in provincial parks on their own or in small groups, while using good social distancing practices.

	The Parks Reservation Service will launch as scheduled next week.  For health and safety reasons, no in-person reservations will be accepted and reservations must be made online athttps://prspub.gov.mb.ca/ or through the call centre, at 204-948-3333 for people in Winnipeg and 1-888-482-2267 for all other areas of the province.  Users should log in to their account before the launch dates to confirm account information and to review reservation and camping policies.

	Public health officials advise the total number of lab-confirmed positive and presumptive positive cases in Manitoba remains at 15 at this time.

	Public health investigations are continuing on the seven additional positive cases identified yesterday.  It appears that six of the seven cases are related to travel.  Further information about travel is pending for the seventh case.

	More than 2,100 patients have been screened for COVID-19 at dedicated testing sites in Winnipeg, Thompson, Flin Flon and The Pas in the past six days including about 430 yesterday.  The province’s eighth dedicated testing site opened today at the Brandon Regional Health Centre, in the Nurses’ Residence Gym  Hours at that location are daily from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

	Additional locations throughout the province will be announced in the days ahead.  The public is reminded that these sites are not walk-in clinics.  Manitobans are asked to call Health Links-Info Santé, who will be able to assess whether testing for COVID-19 is needed and can provide a referral.  The Health Links-Info Santé number is 204-788-8200 and 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free).

	Twenty students from the University of Manitoba have been added to support occupational health services, which is tasked with screening and responding to inquiries from staff and physicians who have returned from travelling internationally in the last 14 days.

	All staff and physicians with international travel history are required to contact occupational health services (OHS) immediately upon return.  Occupational health services staff are working within clinically determined and evidence-based guidelines to assess all returning staff.  All facilities and departments have been directed to identify staff and physicians who are operationally required.  Those individuals are then assessed by OHS for the type of work they do including consideration of their exposure to high-risk patients and the circumstances of their travel.

	Those operationally required staff and physicians who are cleared to return to work will have no or limited contact with patients, are required to wear personal protective equipment all times during their shift and must self-monitor for symptoms including monitoring their temperature twice per day.

	Public health is recommending that support services to seniors programs focused on providing congregate meals be suspended.  At long-term care facilities and for assisted living, congregate meals follow public health recommendations on social distancing.  Individuals who have returned from international travel in the past 14 days have been instructed to self-isolate or self-monitor.  Those who are suffering from cold- or flu-like symptoms should not participate in congregate meal programs.

	The Manitoba government is taking additional proactive measures to help reduce the impact of COVID-19.  This includes:
	•    suspending services at licensed child-care centres, effective end-of-day Friday, March 20;
	•    recommending parents with children in these centres begin to make alternate arrangements as soon as possible, even though centres will remain open for the remainder of the week;
	•    continuing to allow home-based child-care providers to operate; and
	•    creating dedicated child-care options for front-line and essential services staff who need them.

	Parents who will be providing front-line health care or are a member of a fire, police or paramedic service and will not be able to find alternative child care while services are suspended are asked to contact 204-945-0776 or 1-888-213-4754 (toll-free).

	Parents are asked to keep all children and youth home if they have a fever or other respiratory illness symptoms.  Schools will be notifying parents that students will be sent home if they have any of these symptoms.

	The province is also advising that:
	•    teachers will continue to be on the job, either in schools or at home, to create learning plans and continue teaching using the distance learning options available; and
	•    all casinos will close effective midnight tonight.

	Public health officials are recommending the immediate suspension of visitors in long-term care facilities across Manitoba.  Exceptions for compassionate reasons or end of life will be made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of individual facility managers.

	In addition, public health officials are recommending the cancellation of gatherings of more than 50 people, consistent with the announcement made by the federal government.

	Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential international travel.  In addition, public health officials are recommending all international travellers should self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after returning to Canada.

	Health officials are reminding physicians, health-care providers and support staff returning from international travel that they MUST self-identify to their organization/site’s occupational health services.

	To support social distancing efforts, Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living’s registration and client services office at 300 Carlton St. will be temporarily closed to the public.  Staff will continue to register people for Manitoba health coverage and Manitoba Pharmacare benefits through email, phone, fax and mail.  Forms and contact information can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/forms.html.

	A new self-assessment tool is now online to help Manitobans determine whether they need to call Health Links–Info Santé to possibly get a referral or to self-isolate.  The tool provides interactive advice to users concerned about whether they have contracted COVID-19.  It is expected the tool will help with call volumes.  For more information, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Additionally, people calling Health Links–Info Santé can soon expect to hear a new interactive voice response system (IVR).  The IVR will allow COVID-19 screening questions to be answered prior to users being connected to operators, which should shorten the length of calls.  This technology is anticipated to be up and running as soon as this afternoon.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 before arriving at a testing site.  Nearly 1,700 patients have visited dedicated testing sites in Winnipeg and Thompson in the past five days including 481 yesterday.

	Given the evolving COVID-19 situation, the health system is now implementing elevated precautions to protect patients, as many have underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk of becoming severely ill due to COVID-19.  Certain individuals should NOT visit acute care or long-term care facilities.  This includes those who have:
	•    returned from international travel in the last 14 days;
	•    been instructed to self-isolate for 14 days; or
	•    have cold or flu-like symptoms, such as a cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat, weakness or headache.

	Effective immediately, only one visitor per patient at a time is allowed in acute care facilities, such as hospitals, across Manitoba.  This does not apply to parents of children in hospital.  Also, exceptions will be made at a manager’s discretion for special circumstances, such as visitors who require an escort or those going to see a patient nearing the end of their life.

	Manitoba’s adult and youth correctional facilities continue to allow visitors, with restrictions in place to protect the health and safety of people in custody as well as staff.  Visits from family members will continue to be allowed but with no contact.  Visits with legal counsel will continue with no changes.  All centres have suspended all visits from volunteers and community agencies until further notice.

	There have been reports of multiple phishing scams related to COVID-19.  Many are asking people for credit card information to provide medication following a positive test results.  This is not a call that Manitobans would receive from public health officials.  Manitobans are advised to not provide any financial data, hang up on the call and to report to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at (toll-free) 1-888-495-8501.

	HSC Winnipeg is restricting the number of public entrances to the campus beginning today, so visitors can be properly screened for COVID-19 upon arrival.  These restrictions will protect patients who may have underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk of severe illness due to COVID-19.  Patients are now only allowed one visitor at a time.  Exceptions will be made at a manager’s discretion for special circumstances, such as visitors who require an escort or those going to see a patient nearing the end of their life.

	Similar measures are being considered for other health-care facilities throughout the province and at long-term care homes.

	Visitors arriving at facilities throughout Manitoba’s health system can expect to be screened upon arrival for COVID-19.  If visitors are ill or have travelled internationally in the past 14 days, or if they have been instructed to self-monitor or self-isolate, they are strongly encouraged to stay home for the well-being of staff, volunteers, patients and the general public.

	CancerCare Manitoba is asking patients with upcoming appointments or tests to call ahead.  Cancer patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19 due to weakened immune systems, so appointments and tests may be rescheduled if not considered urgent or patients are not actively being treated for the disease.

	Similarly, patients living with kidney disease are also at higher risk of infection.  Scheduled dialysis treatments are proceeding as usual for patients who are well.  However, dialysis patients experiencing cold- or flu-like symptoms who have returned from international travel in the past 14 days are asked to call Health Links-Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 for an initial assessment.  They are also asked to call their renal unit before leaving home for a dialysis treatment or clinic visit so staff can prepare to treat them in a way that keeps them and others from possibly being exposed to COVID-19.

	In keeping with social distancing strategies outlined to Manitobans and in consultation with key stakeholders, public health officials have advised suspending classes in Manitoba kindergarten to Grade 12 schools effective March 23 to April 10.  This is being done to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Manitoba.

	Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:
	•    ensure ill staff and students stay home from school, and support those who are self-isolating at home to ensure they do not fall behind in their studies;
	•    reduce activities in large groups and crowds;
	•    increase desk distance between students; and
	•    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms to reduce the number of people in classrooms and increase distance between staff and students.

	Public health officials continue to recommend social distancing measures for all Manitobans including:
	•    cancelling or postponing any large-scale events (events with more than 250 attendees);
	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;
	•    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;
	•    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;
	•    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill with the virus; and
	•    avoiding all non-essential travel, as well as crowded places and events.

	Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps to ensure employees can stay home when ill, without facing barriers such as the requirement for sick notes, and work from home if possible.  Employers should also discontinue non-essential, work-related travel outside of Manitoba and encourage virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, close contact between individuals.

	People are encouraged to take common prevention measures including regular handwashing with soap and warm water for at least 15 seconds.  Make sure to dry hands thoroughly.  Alternatively, people can use an alcohol-based hand cleanser if their hands are not visibly dirty.  People should also cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or cough or sneeze into their sleeve.

	Being prepared also means using official sources for the most up-to-date and accurate information.  The Manitoba government is also urging media to exercise caution in reporting information related to the evolving COVID-19 situation and to avoid hearsay or speculation, as this can spread misinformation.

	Three previously announced presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 have been lab confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed positive cases in Manitoba to four.  Public health investigations are continuing, but it appears that all four cases are travel related.

	In keeping with social distancing strategies outlined to Manitobans and in consultation with key stakeholders, public health officials have advised suspending classes in Manitoba kindergarten to Grade 12 schools effective March 23 to April 10.  This is being done to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Manitoba.

	Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:

	•    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms to reduce the number of people in classrooms and increase distance between staff and students.

	Testing for COVID-19 has increased to more than 500 tests per day.  Staff at the Cadham Provincial Laboratory are working hard to ensure results are available within 24 to 48 hours after a test is received at the lab.  Once a positive test result is identified, the patient is notified by public health immediately.

	Technical improvements were made to Health Links–Info Santé on Friday, allowing the service to handle more than 100 callers simultaneously, which is nearly triple its usual capacity.  Further technical enhancements are being worked on and staffing numbers continue to be increased.  The public is asked to continue to contact Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for COVID-19 and other health concerns including international travellers who have developed cold- or flu-like symptoms within the past 14 days of returning to Canada.

	All health-care providers in the province are being strongly advised to cancel or postpone all non-essential travel outside of Manitoba.  All staff have been told they should be prepared to self-isolate for 14 days if they choose to travel internationally including to the United States.

	Public health officials continue to recommend social distancing measures for all Manitobans including:

	Health-care providers are strongly discouraging the public from visiting any health-care facility, including long-term care facilities, if they have:
	•    returned from international travel in the past 14 days;
	•    been directed to self-monitor or self-isolate for 14 days; or
	•    are experiencing cold and flu symptoms, such as a cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat, headache or weakness.

	Visitors arriving at health-care facilities may also be asked direct questions about their symptoms, contacts and travel history upon arrival.  This includes HSC Winnipeg, which will begin restricting access points to the campus on Sunday to ensure proper screening of visitors arriving at the facility can occur.

	Traffic at the four community screening locations in Winnipeg continues.  These locations include Access sites in Fort Garry, Winnipeg West and Transcona, as well as the Mount Carmel Clinic.  All sites are open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. this weekend, and 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  Patients should be referred for testing to attend to the community screening locations.  Walk-in traffic without a referral is discouraged.

	Additionally, HSC Winnipeg has also opened a testing clinic for low-acuity patients in its William Avenue mall, where patients can be tested for both COVID-19 and influenza.

	Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps to ensure employees can stay home when ill, without facing barriers such as the requirement for sick notes, and work from home if possible.  Employers should also discontinue non-essential, work-related travel outside of Manitoba and encourage virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, close contact between individuals.

	To date, three presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Manitoba.  In addition, Manitoba public health officials are recommending that Manitobans should consider taking additional social distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

	Public health is updating a flight number from Vancouver International Airport to Winnipeg where individuals may have been exposed to COVID-19.  Individuals on Air Canada flight AC 8622 on March 7 and March 8 in rows 24 to 29 are asked to self-isolate and monitor themselves for symptoms for 14 days since their last known contact or exposure.  For more information on self-isolation and self-monitoring, visit www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/factsheets/coronavirus_selfisolation.pdf.

	Social distancing measures include cancelling or postponing any large-scale events with more than 250 attendees.  This measure helps reduce prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between other individuals in public.

	In addition, individuals in Winnipeg directed by Health Links–Info Santé to be tested for COVID-19 will be asked to visit a community screening location.  Two new screening sites will both open at noon today.

	One is at Mount Carmel Clinic (886 Main St.) and the other is at Access Transcona (845 Regent Ave. W.).  This is in addition to two other sites that opened on March 12 at Access Winnipeg West (at 280 Booth Dr.) and Access Fort Garry (135 Plaza Dr.)

	These four sites will serve as COVID-19 community screening sites, in addition to continuing with their regular operations.  Patients should be referred for testing to attend to the community screening locations.  Walk-in traffic without a referral is discouraged.

	Testing at these sites will be available Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Those who require screening, assessment and/or testing after hours will still be directed to urgent care sites and emergency departments.

	People living outside Winnipeg who are concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 can visit www.gov.mb.ca/health/coronavirus/ or call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for further information.

	Work is also underway to increase capacity at Health Links–Info Santé.  Staffing levels have been doubled and additional staff are being pulled in from other areas and trained today.  Caller options have been streamlined and there is now a dedicated COVID-19 number to press.  Usual scripts have also been shortened to reduce the length of calls once they are answered.

	Public health officials continue to recommend these social distancing measures for all Manitobans:
	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;
	•    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;
	•    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;
	•    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill with the virus; and

Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) and public health officials are advising Manitobans of the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in the province.

	A woman in her 40s who lives in the area of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority has tested positive for COVID-19.  At this time, it appears the individual was exposed to the virus through recent travel to the Philippines.  The individual is recovering at home in stable condition.

	As of March 11, 403 tests have been completed for COVID-19 in Manitoba.  

	A pandemic has now been declared by the World Health Organization, and social distancing strategies are now being recommended to all Manitobans to limit the spread of COVID-19.

	Those at the greatest risk of severe outcomes include those over 65 years of age, those with underlying medical conditions and those with compromised immune systems.  Public health officials are also reminding all Manitobans to frequently wash their hands, cough and sneeze into their sleeves and to stay home when sick.

	Social distancing strategies for all Manitobans include:
	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between other individuals in public;
	•    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;
	•    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;
	•    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill with the virus; and
	•    considering avoiding travel, crowded places and events, especially if you are at higher risk.
	    
	Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:
	•    ensure ill staff and students stay home from school, and support those who are self-isolating at home to ensure they do not fall behind in their studies;
	•    reduce large-group, crowded activities;
	•    increase desk distance between students; and
	•    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms, which reduces the number of people in classrooms and increases distance between staff and students.

	Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps to ensure their employees can:
	•    stay home when ill, without facing barriers such as the requirement for sick notes; and
	•    work from home if possible.

	Employers should also consider:
	•    discontinuing non-essential work related travel outside of Manitoba; and
	•    encouraging virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, close contact between individuals.

	Manitobans are strongly advised to review travel plans given the evolving risk throughout many parts of the world and Canada.  Frequently review the Government of Canada’s COVID-19 related travel advisories at www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html.

	The following measures are in place:
	•    All respiratory specimens submitted to the provincial lab will be tested for COVID-19 (even if COVID-19 testing was not ordered by the health-care provider).
	•    Travelers returning from Italy, Iran and the province of Hubei are asked to self-isolate for 14 days after departing the area.  
	•    All returning international travellers should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days after returning to Canada.  Travellers who develop cold or flu-like symptoms within 14 days of returning to Canada should contact Health Links-Info Santé to determine if testing for COVID-19 should be considered.  In cases where testing is not recommended, they should self-isolate until they are well.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should first call Health Links–Info Sante at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) to ensure they receive medical advice appropriate to their specific health concerns.

	Starting March 12, individuals in Winnipeg directed by Health Links–Info Sante to be tested for COVID-19 will be asked to visit a community screening location.  The first two community screening locations will open today, at Access Winnipeg West (at 280 Booth Dr.) and Access Fort Garry
	(135 Plaza Dr.).

	Screening will be available at these locations from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. on weekdays and until 4 p.m. on weekends.  Those who require screening after hours will still be directed to urgent care sites and emergency departments. In addition to screening, these centres remain open for regularly scheduled clinic activities.

	People living outside Winnipeg who are concerned about their exposure to or risk of having
	COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for further information.

MANITOBA INTRODUCES LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CLARIFY SCOPE OF TRIBUNALS, IMPROVE TIMELINESS OF REVIEWS OF HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLAINTS


	The Manitoba government has introduced two pieces of legislation that would clarify and streamline the work of important decision-making bodies, with the goal of providing more timely access for Manitobans, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	The administrative tribunal jurisdiction act would allow government to determine which have the authority to hear constitutional and charter issues, recognizing these decisions require specialized expertise.  

	“Administrative tribunals are important decision-making bodies, responsible for a broad range of issues that affect Manitobans’ lives,” said Cullen.  “However, it is inefficient and impractical for all of them to make decisions on complex constitutional matters.  This legislation would allow government to clarify roles, ensuring all administrative tribunals can provide more timely decisions for Manitobans in their areas of expertise.”

	There are dozens of administrative tribunals in Manitoba, responsible for making decisions on a broad range of matters.  This includes the Residential Tenancies Commission, which hears disputes between landlords and tenants; the Automobile Injury Compensation Appeal Commission, which hears complaints about payments for bodily injuries paid by Manitoba Public Insurance; and the Judicial Council, which hears charges of misconduct involving provincial court judges.

	The minister noted it would be inefficient for all tribunals to hear constitutional issues, as the need to access external legal expertise or provide members with the necessary legal background could add significant delays and costs.  

	Following a legal review and analysis, the province would determine which administrative tribunals would have jurisdiction to decide questions of constitutional law and formalize this approach in regulation.  Alberta and British Columbia have similar legislation in place to clarify which tribunals can hear constitutional issues.

	The second piece of legislation introduced today is The Human Rights Code Amendment Act.  It builds on an independent review of the Manitoba Human Rights Commission and the Manitoba Human Rights Adjudication Panel and its recommendations to address complaints in a more timely and efficient manner.

	The amendments would empower the commission to make decisions sooner by allowing the commission’s executive director to dismiss complaints, including those outside its jurisdiction, and to decline to investigate complaints that are being adequately addressed in another forum.  The process for adjudication would be improved by giving adjudicators the authority to mediate complaints and setting time limits to ensure the adjudicators’ hearings and decisions are timely.

	The changes would also set the maximum financial award for injury to dignity, feelings or self-respect stemming from a human rights complaint at $25,000.  There would continue to be no cap on other compensation dealing with lost wages, income or benefits and existing caps on financial penalties related to malicious or reckless actions remain in place.

	“Our government is taking steps to respond to the independent review of the commission and adjudication panel,” said Cullen. “In the past, it has sometimes taken years for a human rights complaint to come to a conclusion.  These amendments will help ensure Manitobans who file a human rights complaint can be confident their matter will be handled in a fair and timely way.”  

	The independent review of the Manitoba Human Rights Commission and the Manitoba Human Rights Adjudication Panel is available at www.manitoba.ca/openmb/infomb/departments.html under Manitoba Justice.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES PAYROLL TAX CUT
					  Changes Will Benefit an Estimated 1,000 Employers Throughout Manitoba:  Fielding


	As part of Budget 2020, the Manitoba government is providing employers with a break on the Health and Post-Secondary Education Tax Levy, commonly called the payroll tax, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“Too many small businesses are paying payroll taxes, which penalizes those who can least afford it,” said Fielding.  “It’s another form of bracket creep and it discourages entrepreneurship and costs jobs.  Budget 2020 increases the payroll tax thresholds, which will result in more jobs and more opportunities for Manitobans.”

	The Health and Post Secondary Education Tax Levy is imposed on wages paid by employers with a permanent establishment in the province.  Approximately 3,000 employers in Manitoba pay around $510 million in payroll taxes per year.

	As of Jan. 1, 2021, Manitoba will increase the following payroll tax thresholds:
	•    employers with an annual payroll of $1.5 million or less will be exempt (up from the current $1.25 million exemption threshold);
	•    employers with an annual payroll between $1.5 million and $3 million will pay 4.3 per cent on the amount within this range (up from the current range of $1.25 million to $2.5 million); and
	•    employers with an annual payroll above $3 million will pay 2.15 per cent of the total payroll (up from the current $2.5 million threshold).

	The increased thresholds are expected to benefit approximately 1,000 employers in Manitoba, and make approximately 220 employers exempt from paying the tax altogether.

	“We have heard from Manitoba business owners and operators that one of the key factors affecting business growth is the tax burden, in particular payroll taxes that affect business growth the most,” said Fielding.  “We are addressing this concern with these changes to make Manitoba an even more attractive place to do business.”

	Manitoba’s payroll tax thresholds have not changed since 2008.

	“Initiatives like this one from the Manitoba government have meaningful impact on businesses like ours,” said Jamie Kozak, Principal Architect at Prairie Architects Inc., a business that will become exempt from paying the tax next year.  “Raising the payroll tax exemption to $1.5 million allows our company to reinvest approximately $5,000 back into our business operations every year.”

	Prairie Architects Inc. is leading the Fort Richmond Collegiate New Life Skills Suite and Band Room Addition and Renovations project, into which the provincial government is investing $1 million.  Fielding visited the work site today to present a new pair of steel-toed work boots to Jaycek Valentine, a junior apprentice on the project.

	This is the fifth year in a row where the Manitoba government carried on its tradition of presenting a new pair of shoes to a deserving Manitoban, rather than the finance minister purchasing himself new shoes to wear on budget day.

	“These work boots symbolize one of our government’s priorities – to create more jobs for Manitobans and drive economic growth,” said Fielding.  “Our Economic Growth Action Plan is growing optimism throughout the province and we are working to create 40,000 new jobs during the current term of government.  We know we are on the right path, as approximately 9,700 more Manitobans were working in the first two months of 2020.”

	Fielding will present Budget 2020 tomorrow afternoon in the Manitoba legislature.

PROVINCE WORKING WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO PURCHASE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR HEALTH WORKERS AND PATIENTS
					  Equipment Will Ensure Patients and Front-Line Workers Have the Protective Equipment They Need To Stay Safe and Minimize Spread of COVID-19: Friesen


	The Manitoba government is working with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), and provinces and territories, to co-ordinate a procurement effort of protective equipment to prepare for the possibility of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Our government, along with provinces and territories, is taking inventory of the personal protective equipment (PPE) currently in our jurisdiction, and planning for what would additionally be required in the event of an outbreak,” said Friesen.  “Ensuring staff throughout the health system have access to the equipment and supplies required for safe patient care and their own personal protection is a priority.”

	Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) is co-managing a provincially co-ordinated Incident Management Structure to ensure appropriate planning, preparation, mitigation and response to the evolving COVID-19 situation, the minister added.  While Manitoba has an adequate supply of PPE at this time, this purchase will ensure the province is well positioned to manage any additional demand on resources that would accompany potential or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Manitoba.

	Current inventory of PPE supplies is being closely monitored, and regions and sites have been asked to take steps to ensure supplies of PPE, including procedure/surgical masks and N95 respirators, are maintained and that providers and staff are aware of their appropriate clinical use.

	The purchase will help to ensure patients, staff, and front-line health workers, have appropriate protective equipment at a competitive price.  The determination of the volume of supplies needed is undertaken collaboratively with the assistance of the Public Health Agency of Canada.  Most personal protective equipment used in clinical environments will not spoil.

	Based on current planning assumptions, including supplies required by Manitoba’s regional health authorities, service delivery organizations, personal care homes and fee-for-service clinics, the projected cost is an estimated $35.2 million.

	PPE supplies are being utilized as health-care facilities and sites across the province in line with clinical recommendations.  This includes use by staff of gloves, gowns, procedure or surgical masks and face/eye protection when dealing with any patients who have flu-like symptoms (cough, fever, difficulty breathing).  Procedure or surgical masks are also provided to patients who show these symptoms, as well as anyone accompanying them.  

	Staff performing certain procedures are required to wear an N95 respirator in addition to eye-protection, gloves and a gown.  Efforts to ensure staff are appropriately trained and fit-tested for the N95 are underway across the province.

	“The government and public health officials are reminding Manitobans the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in Manitoba remains low, but is increasing given events occurring in Canada and around the world.  We must continue to prepare for this virus in Manitoba,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief public health officer.

	The Manitoba government is working with Shared Health, Manitoba’s regional health authorities and service delivery organizations as well as the Public Health Agency of Canada to share information and best practices.

	Common personal prevention and preparedness measures for viruses such as COVID-19 and influenza include regular hand washing with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and staying home when you are sick, regardless of recent travel.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.

	The Manitoba government is seeking input from Manitobans to ensure its project to name geographical features in honour of Manitoba soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War also respects local and historical geographical names, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“We will be commemorating the ultimate sacrifices made by Manitoba soldiers in the First World War by naming nearly 8,000 geographical features in their honour,” said Pedersen.  “As part of that process, we also want to respect places that already have local or historical names.  We are calling on Manitobans to help us with this important work.”

	Only geographical features with no known local names will become part of the First World War commemoration project, which is expected to be complete later this year.  The minister noted public input will help ensure local culture and history are represented and recorded as part of the process. 

	Manitoba has already named more than 4,200 lakes, islands, bays and other geographical features to honour fallen Manitoba soldiers who served from the Second World War to the present day.

	To review the geographical features proposed for naming, visit https://engagemb.ca/world-war-I-commemorative-naming-project. Manitobans may also contact the Manitoba Geographical Names Program at GeographicalNames@gov.mb.ca or the regional conservation district offices in The Pas or Thompson.

LAKE MANITOBA AND LAKE ST. MARTIN OUTLET CHANNELS PROJECT REACHES MILESTONE


	The Lake Manitoba Lake St. Martin Outlet Channels project has advanced to the next phase of the assessment process, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“Completing this crucial climate-change adaptation project – a project that will provide certainty for many communities and families – is one of our government’s top priorities and I am proud of the work we have done to reach this stage,” said Schuler.  “We are pleased to share the Environmental Impact Statement for public comment and we are eager to begin the next phase of the environmental assessment process, which is the technical review.”

	In 2011, Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin reached record high water levels.  The province has committed to building two permanent outlet channels to alleviate flooding in that part of the Interlake region.

	“We have worked hard to achieve progress on this project, spent more than $50 million in consultation and preliminary engineering, design and preparation work,” said Schuler.  “We are very pleased the federal government is committed to working together, and that we’re finally achieving progress on project timelines, while being respectful to all concerned.”

	Before construction begins, the project requires federal and provincial regulatory approvals.  Both governments will continue to engage in Crown-Indigenous consultations with all potentially impacted communities, and the province is in the process of signing consultation agreements with Indigenous communities.

	During the next stage, set to begin immediately, the federal and provincial governments will be seeking feedback from subject matter experts, the public and Indigenous communities through the public registries to address further concerns and clarification.

	“Jointly with our partners in the federal government, we will be investing resources to ensure meaningful consultation and co-ordination with Indigenous communities and other stakeholders,” said Schuler.  “We are confident in the merits of the project and look forward to any feedback the federal government, Indigenous groups and communities, and stakeholders will provide.”

	To date, the province has engaged with 39 Indigenous communities and groups identified by provincial and federal requirements, and is in the process of signing consultation agreements with 10 First Nation communities that will be impacted by the project.

	Increasing frequency of severe weather and flood events creates an even more pressing need to put safeguards in place to protect communities and families, the minister said.  Projects like these and other adaptation infrastructure, will help give communities and families their lives back while setting Manitoba on a course for greater security and economic certainty, he added.

MANITOBA INTRODUCES LEGISLATION THAT WOULD  IMPROVE ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES


	The Manitoba government is introducing legislation that would provide more affordable and accessible options for legal information and representation while still ensuring appropriate public protections are in place, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“The current approach to accessing legal advice is limited, with few options available to Manitobans,” said Cullen.  “For some people, the cost of hiring a lawyer is prohibitive, meaning they go without the advice they need.  Others need some advice and support, but not the full scope of legal services that a lawyer provides.  This change enables the creation and regulation of alternative legal service providers to meet the needs of Manitobans, improving access to justice for all.”

	The practice of law is regulated by the Law Society of Manitoba and currently, for the most part, legal services can only be provided by lawyers and articling students.  The proposed amendments to The Legal Profession Act would allow the Law Society to designate and regulate another category of regulated legal service provider, called a limited practitioner, who can provide specified legal services.  The legislation would also allow the Law Society to determine who could be designated as a limited practitioner, what their scope of work might be, and what training and education would be required.

	“The benchers of the Law Society of Manitoba are committed to being leaders in the advancement of increased access to justice for all Manitobans,” said Anita Southall, president, Law Society of Manitoba.  “This proposed legislation will permit the Law Society to establish the scope of practice for limited practitioners and to ensure that those who provide services will only do so with appropriate training and education, and in prescribed areas that pose no risk to the public.”

	The minister noted these changes could help support plans to modernize and streamline the family law system in Manitoba.  For example, changes might enable a limited practitioner to provide advice on parenting arrangements, child and spousal support, or how to handle shared property.  

	“By extending the authority of the Law Society in this way, the scope of work handled by limited practitioners can evolve to better meet the legal needs of Manitobans,” said Cullen.  “It has the expertise of regulating legal services in the public interest.”

	The Law Society recommended changes to government following its review of alternative legal service providers, which found there were unmet legal needs in the province and there was a need for more affordable alternatives for legal advice, information and representation.  The legislative changes are modelled on similar amendments recently introduced in Saskatchewan.

PROVINCE TO MODERNIZE LICENSING FOR OUTDOOR ENTHUSIASTS, IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY AND ACCESSIBILITY
					  Gradual Rollout Starts with Hunting, Angling Licences and Provincial Park Vehicle Permits


	The Manitoba government has introduced legislation that would pave the way for a new, online service for the sale of outdoor licenses and permits, Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard and Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“There are endless adventures to be had in our great outdoors,” said Guillemard.  “We are excited to improve and modernize the way Manitobans and visitors access and enjoy the many outdoor activities offered throughout our province and in our provincial parks.  Moving to an online system from a paper-based one will enable our government to improve the services we deliver, while decreasing our carbon footprint.”

	The province recognizes this is a significant change in the way people will access licences and park permits so it will be phased in, starting with hunting and angling licenses as well as provincial park vehicle permits this spring, Guillemard said.

	Users would be able to go online, create a customer profile, select the desired product or licence, and check out as they would with any other online purchase.  There will also be an option to purchase licences and permits online at Manitoba Conservation and Climate offices around the province and at participating retailers.  A digital copy of the licence would be available to download from the customer’s account and a copy must be printed out and carried while hunting or fishing so it can be presented upon request.  Park vehicle permits would also have to be printed for display on the vehicle’s dashboard.

	“The Manitoba Wildlife Federation has been advocating to have e-licensing brought to the province for years,” said Chris Heald, executive director, Manitoba Wildlife Federation.  “We appreciate the work that has gone into this project and are glad to see the province has listened to the voice of hunters, anglers and trappers.  We look forward to having access to the added convenience this system allows.”

	Benefits of using an e-licensing approach would include:
	•    access 24 hours a day, seven days a week online or by telephone;   
	•    access through participating retailers (list will be available online);
	•    the ability to immediately purchase and print licenses and permits at home;
	•    receiving email confirmation of licences/permits purchased; and
	•    improved data collection that will support program management.
	 
	“With expanded access such as the ability to make purchases from a smartphone or mobile device, we are using technology to move Manitoba forward,” said Pedersen.  “As Manitobans embrace the new system, we will roll out additional licences and permits for purchase online and continue taking steps to improve our services.”

	This initiative is a priority as identified in the ministers’ mandate letter, and supports the government’s commitment to enhance public services, reduce red tape and advance innovative technology solutions.

	In addition to current base licence fees, an administration fee of $4.50 will be included in all licences and permit purchases to support enhanced service delivery, with the exception of the Manitoba Resident Seniors Conservation Angling Licences that will remain free of charge.

					  Municipalities Provided Fair Say to Strengthen Election Rules:  Squires


	The Manitoba government has introduced legislative changes that would increase transparency, create a level playing field and provide a fair say to municipalities for municipal elections, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires announced today.

	“Voters in municipal elections should have the same assurances as those in provincial elections that their elected officials are not unfairly using their position as incumbents or using taxpayer resources to influence voters,” Squires said.  “These changes also include measures that have been requested by municipalities that will reduce red tape for them during elections.”

	The proposed changes include measures such as:
	•    giving fair say to municipalities to pass a bylaw establishing rules and procedures for the use of municipal resources in a municipal election by candidates;
	•    restricting incumbents from using their position title in election communication;
	•    allowing Brandon, Thompson, Portage la Prairie and Flin Flon to set their council size, aligning practices among all other municipalities outside of Winnipeg;   
	•    streamlining how all municipalities are required to refund excess taxes in a fair manner, effective July 1;
	•    exempting regional public libraries from municipal taxation to ensure public libraries remain exempt from municipal taxation; and
	•    strengthening provisions to protect vulnerable Winnipeg residents facing a tax sale from unscrupulous lenders.

	The province has had ongoing consultations with the Association of Manitoba Municipalities and many of these changes are the result of municipal requests.  Additional consultations will occur as the changes are implemented, as they are expected to be in effect for the 2022 Municipal General Election, the minister noted.

	Manitoba is recognizing International Women’s Day by launching a new awards program to honour women who have made outstanding contributions to the advancement of gender equality, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox, minister responsible for the status of women, announced today.

	“Women make important contributions that enrich all aspects of life in Manitoba including community service, law, education, arts and culture,” said Cox.  “As we celebrate International Women’s Day in 2020, I’m proud to announce the ‘Empower Women 20/20 Awards’, which will honour the outstanding women who have helped to further gender equality in our province.”

	In all, 20 awards will be presented to recognize women who have developed activities, programs or movements to advance gender equality in Manitoba, reflecting the province’s rich diversity and regional representation.  The Manitoba Women’s Advisory Council will play a role in reviewing all the award nominations.

	International Women’s Day (March 8) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women.  The day also marks a call to action for accelerating women’s equality.

	This year marks the 100-year anniversary of the election of Edith Rogers, the first woman elected to the Manitoba legislative assembly.

	“Manitoba women began the movement of women getting the right to vote and be elected to the provincial legislature in 1916 and the 1920 election was the first after the change in legislation,” Cox said.  “Edith ran in 1920, 1922 and 1927 – winning her seat in all three elections.  Beyond her career in politics, she was also active with various organizations in Manitoba and was a strong advocate for soldiers’ dependents after the First World War.”

	The names of this year’s award recipients will be announced during Gender Equality Week, Sept. 20 to 26.  More information and nomination forms can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/msw/empower_women_2020.html.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS CRIME STOPPERS CAMPAIGN TARGETING METHAMPHETAMINE
					  Partnership Will Help Encourage Manitobans to Share Tips on Illicit Drugs: Cullen

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is investing $180,000 to support a co-ordinated provincewide campaign led by Crime Stoppers to help identify and stop methamphetamine dealers and traffickers, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“Criminals dealing illicit drugs, and particularly meth, are a danger to all Manitobans,” said Cullen.  “This partnership with Crime Stoppers will help ensure Manitobans with important information to share can feel safe making an anonymous report to better their community.  We believe this campaign will clearly highlight why it is important to call the tip line and be a part of the solution.”

	The three Crime Stoppers organizations serving Manitoba will jointly develop a multimedia campaign to encourage people to report information about meth-related crimes, such as dealing or trafficking.  The campaign is expected to launch across the province this week.  Funding will also be used to expand cash awards available to people who provide anonymous tips that result in meth-related arrests, building on the organizations’ existing successful approach.

	“Law enforcement can not win this battle on their own,” said Paul Johnson, chair, Winnipeg Crime Stoppers.  “They need everyone’s help to provide the information they need to stop the flow of methamphetamine into our communities.  Every piece of information – no matter how trivial – is important.  The three Crime Stoppers programs are proud to be part of that community to create a ‘made-in-Manitoba solution’ to address this crisis.”

	The provincial investment is provided through the Federal Proceeds of Crime Fund, which is forfeited from federally prosecuted Criminal Code offences.  The province has also distributed nearly
	$2.5 million to law enforcement agencies across Manitoba from this fund and the Criminal Property Forfeiture Fund this year.  It has been used to:
	•    purchase specialized equipment and training for police agencies to improve officer and community safety,
	•    support the victims’ assistance fund, and
	•    invest in community organizations leading public safety and crime prevention initiatives.

	For more information about criminal property forfeiture, visit www.gov.mb.ca/justice/commsafe/cpf/index.html.

	The minister noted this project follows other recently announced initiatives valued at more than
	$25 million to continue improving mental health and addictions services in Manitoba including:
	•    a request for proposals to add 100 supportive recovery-housing beds,
	•    recruiting new community helpers,
	•    investing in a collaboration between StreetReach Winnipeg and the Manitoba Adolescent Treatment Centre, and
	•    expanding the distribution of Thrival Kits.

	Every year, Crime Stoppers organizations in Manitoba receive more than 4,200 anonymous tips from Manitobans. For more information, visit www.winnipegcrimestoppers.org/,  www.brandoncrimestoppers.com/  or http://manitobacrimestoppers.com/.

	Manitoba’s employment levels are off to a strong start in 2020, according to the latest report from Statistics Canada, Finance Minister Scott Fielding and Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“Our government is moving forward on our commitment to grow Manitoba’s economy and create 40,000 new jobs over the next four years by fixing our finances and making the province an attractive place to do business,” said Fielding.  “Manitoba’s labour market remains strong as shown by our solid track record to date.”

	The latest figures show an employment increase of 3,200 in February in Manitoba.  It follows an increase of 6,500 in January, resulting in approximately 9,700 more Manitobans working in the first two months of 2020.

	According to the latest figures, Manitoba increased by more than double the national average.  The increase in employment in February was accompanied by a decline in Manitoba’s unemployment rate to five per cent, down from 5.1 per cent in January and 5.3 per cent in 2019.  Manitoba continues to have the second lowest unemployment rate among Canadian provinces.

	“We are working with industry and employers to ensure Manitoba workers will have the knowledge and skills they need to meet the needs of in-demand careers now and in the future,” said Eichler. “This is proving to be an effective strategy to continue job market growth.”

	The province’s labour force has increased by 2,800 workers, a 0.4 per cent increase, while the country’s rate as a whole increased by 0.2 per cent.  Compared to the previous February, the labour force increased 1.3 per cent in Manitoba.

CANADA AND MANITOBA LAUNCH APPLICATION PROCESS FOR THE EFFICIENT TRUCKING PROGRAM


	A growing number of Canadians are choosing clean transportation. This choice saves energy and money while protecting the environment and building clean transportation networks brings good jobs and economic growth. That’s why the Government of Canada is focusing on finding faster, cheaper, cleaner ways to get Canadians where they are going.

	Today, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, and Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard, launched the application process for Manitoba’s Efficient Trucking Program.

	This program is now accepting proposals that will support retrofits in the transportation sector. Eligible applicants can receive a rebate of up to 50 per cent on fuel-saving devices and technologies like idling technologies, low-rolling resistant tires and trailer skirts. The program will be delivered by Red River College and will reduce energy consumption and emissions in Manitoba. Interested applicants with innovative technologies have until March 31 to apply through www.gov.mb.ca/climateandgreenplan/index.html.

	The Efficient Trucking Program will receive up to $5.9 million through the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund. The government of Manitoba is also contributing $5.9 million toward the program.

	Canada’s climate plan is on track to deliver the largest emissions reduction in the country’s history but these initiatives are just the beginning. The federal government will continue to bring forward new and enhanced climate action measures to exceed its 2030 target and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

MANITOBA SUPPORTS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, ONLINE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN TO ADDRESS CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION
					  Manitoba Proclaims March 9 to 15 as Stop Child Sexual Exploitation Awareness Week:  Ministers


Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is investing more than $100,000 with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P) to help protect children and youth from the dangers of online sexual exploitation, Families Minister Heather Stefanson and Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“Our government is committed to keeping children safe, but as technology changes and evolves, so do the risks,” said Stefanson, who signed a proclamation today to designate March 9 to 15 as Stop Child Sexual Exploitation Awareness Week in Manitoba.  “C3P is a recognized expert in talking to parents, young people and educators about important issues like digital safety and online exploitation.  We are happy to partner with them on campaigns to help keep us all better informed and ready to intervene when it is needed.”

	Every year, the Manitoba government invests millions of dollars to address sexual exploitation through Tracia’s Trust, the province’s strategy to deal with this important issue.  Today, the ministers announced an additional $83,000 to C3P to develop and launch an online campaign through Cybertip.ca this spring to help parents of tweens, aged nine to 12, better understand the risks associated with livestreaming, gaming platforms and live chat features.  Lessons will also be developed for teachers to share with students on how to identify and respond to unsafe situations online.  Supporting information will be shared through C3P’s Kids in the Know newsletter. 

	Another $20,000 has been invested by the province through the Federal Proceeds of Crime Fund to expand educational resources related to preventing sexual exploitation and supporting online safety into two additional school divisions in Winnipeg.

	“Our partnership will help ensure more Manitoba youth, parents and educators have the knowledge and tools to be safe online and in their daily lives,” said Cullen.  “As the potential risks related to exploitation, cyberbullying and other types of victimization evolve, it is essential to have accurate and timely information.  We are proud to partner with C3P, a recognized national leader, to help keep kids safe.”

	Funding will provide free access to the Commit to Kids program at all 57 schools in the Seine River and River East Transcona school divisions.  It provides strategies, policies and a step-by-step plan for reducing the risk of child sexual abuse.  Teachers will also have access to the Kids in the Know program, which is used to help educate students about personal safety strategies that build resilience and reduce their likelihood of victimization. 

	“Through Cybertip.ca, we’re seeing kids as young as eight years old being targeted by adults through livestreaming or gaming apps and websites,” said Signy Arnason, associate executive director, C3P.  “This initiative is about informing parents/teachers on the emerging risks and providing guidance on how to have ongoing, age-appropriate online safety conversations with children.”

	There are more than 20,000 students in both school divisions.  They and their families will receive educational, age-appropriate resources dealing with issues such as cyberbullying, online safety, abuse prevention, exploitation and healthy relationships.  Community organizations will receive posters, cards and other materials to raise public awareness of the issues related to the victimization of children.  All materials are available in English and French.

	Every year, the Manitoba government invests about $15 million in initiatives related to sexual exploitation through Tracia’s Trust, including:
	•    Restoring the Sacred, a culturally based peer mentorship program for Indigenous people aged 14 to 21 who are relocating to Winnipeg to continue their education;
	•    educational opportunities for people with lived experience in sexual exploitation to achieve a post-secondary certificate or diploma in child and youth care;
	•    regional teams located throughout Manitoba to increase public awareness on the issue of sexual exploitation;
	•    specialized placement resources for sexually exploited youth; and
	•    youth shelter resources.

	Through Tracia’s Trust, the province also operates StreetReach, a Winnipeg-based collaborative team that helps identify children and youth at risk of being victimized in the sex trade, and returns them to a place of safety.

	The online campaign led by C3P builds on more than $25 million the government has invested in other recent mental health initiatives that support children and youth, including:
	•    the launch of Granny’s House, a one-year pilot project to provide short-term, culturally safe and community-led care to children and families;
	•    a recruitment of new community helpers;
	•    a collaboration between StreetReach Winnipeg and the Manitoba Adolescent Treatment Centre; and
	•    an expansion of the distribution of Thrival Kits.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT ENHANCES FILM AND VIDEO PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT
					  Incentive to Encourage Private-sector Investment and Attract More Movie Business in Manitoba:  Ministers





	As part of Budget 2020, the Manitoba government plans to enhance the Film and Video Production Tax Credit to encourage private-sector investment in permanent film infrastructure and attract more animation, visual effects (VFX) and post-production companies to relocate or do business in the province, Finance Minister Scott Fielding and Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox announced today.

	“We are pleased to support Manitoba’s successful film production industry and continue to elevate our province’s reputation as a destination for film and video production, and a place where young Manitobans want to build their careers in that industry,” said Fielding.  “This has been a robust year for the film production industry, as demonstrated by the increased demand for the credit to the current in-year forecast amount of $42.5 million from our 2019 budget amount of $31.5 million.”

	In the 2020-21 budget, a new Manitoba Production Company Bonus of eight per cent will be added to the 30 per cent cost-of-production credit, increasing the total cost-of-production credit to 38 per cent.  The ministers noted that improvements are based on advice from the Manitoba Film and Video Production Tax Credit Working Group.

	“With these changes, we hope to see more post-production spending in Manitoba, increased employment opportunities for Manitoba VFX artists, editors and animators, and attract animation post-production and visual effects companies to open new facilities,” said Cox.  “We want to make Manitoba even more competitive with other jurisdictions across the country.” 

	The ministers noted the province continues to build momentum, with the media production industry attracting two companies to open offices in Manitoba.  Urban Prairie Post, a Toronto based post-production and visual effects house, now employs many Manitobans at its new facilities in Winnipeg.  The Cartel opened its Canadian head office in Manitoba and has produced over a dozen ‘movies of the week’ since opening its permanent establishment.  

	“We applaud this announcement as it positions Manitoba at the forefront to capitalize on the global demand for content,” said Rachel Rusen Margolis, CEO and film commissioner, Manitoba Film and Music.  “The enhancement to the all-spend credit incentivizes inward investment to further develop the lucrative VFX, animation and post-production sectors in the province.  The government’s commitment to this industry will result in job creation that will retain local talent and attract new residents to build their careers in media in Manitoba.”

	The ministers said growth in the media production industry may also contribute toward the government’s commitment to create 40,000 private-sector jobs in Manitoba over the next four years.  Manitoba’s thriving film production industry will also benefit from proposed changes to The Highway Traffic Act announced this week that will permit a local traffic authority to authorize certified flag people to control traffic on roads, rather than relying on local law enforcement.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT REMOVES RED TAPE AROUND FILM PRODUCTION TRAFFIC CONTROL
					  Local Traffic Authority Will Permit Use of Certified Flag Persons to Control Traffic:  Ministers


	Manitoba’s thriving film production industry will benefit from proposed changes to The Highway Traffic Act that would give them more flexibility to acquire traffic control services on roads, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler and Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox announced today.

	“These legislative changes will provide more options to organizations that require traffic control services for film productions or special events that use Manitoba roads and ease the demand on law enforcement for traffic control services,” said Schuler.  “Without these legislative changes, organizations may decide to forgo Manitoba as a production location if they face challenges in securing traffic control services.”

	The changes would allow a traffic authority (either the province or municipalities) to permit certified flag people to temporarily control traffic, in situations where it is safe to do so.  Traffic control on Manitoba roads is currently limited to, in case of emergency, police, RCMP and firefighters, and railway companies and contractors performing road maintenance and construction.

	“Our government made a throne speech commitment to boost film and television production in the province, and our growing film and video industry is projected to generate more than $250 million into our economy in 2019-20,” said Cox.  “Demand in rural Manitoba for law enforcement to provide traffic control services for film productions continues to increase, and this proposed amendment will help the film and video industry continue to grow.”

	“Manitoba Film and Music supports the amendment to The Highway Traffic Act which would allow certified flag people to manage traffic flow where appropriate for film shoots,” said Rachel Rusen Margolis, CEO and film commissioner, Manitoba Film and Music.  “This amendment would ultimately result in savings for film productions shooting on provincial highways, providing an additional incentive for off-shore productions who choose Manitoba as a shooting location.”

	“The RCMP in Manitoba has long supported film and television production by providing officers to help direct and control traffic at locations across the province,” said Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy, commanding officer of the Manitoba RCMP.  “This amendment will allow our officers to focus on core policing duties and will help to ensure that we continue to provide the very best in front-line policing services to our communities.”

	Flag people used to control traffic would need a valid flag person certificate from an accredited training provider.  The province provides approval for flag person-training providers in Manitoba.

	The Manitoba government has established a new transition committee to work with staff affected by the upcoming closure of the Dauphin Correctional Centre (DCC) and help connect them with employment, training and other resources, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“We recognize this is a challenging time for employees and their families, which is why we are putting additional supports in place during this transition,” said Cullen.  “The goal of this transition committee is to help answer questions, identify resources and connect our employees and their families with their next opportunity.”

	The work of this committee extends beyond the agreements in place with the union and other requirements set out under the collective agreement, the minister noted.  The transition committee will:
	•    connect employees with other public service jobs throughout Manitoba, based on their qualifications, interests and preferences;
	•    help family members who are also government employees to find other provincial opportunities in new locations;
	•    find opportunities for retraining or other employment for those who wish to remain in Dauphin and the surrounding region; and
	•    identify other resources available to support employees and their family members.

	The transition committee includes representatives from various government departments, including human resources professionals, and the Dauphin Economic Development HUB, who will help to ensure the group is aware of all opportunities in the region.

	DCC employees have received initial information about the role of the committee, and additional information will be available to employees and Manitobans in the weeks ahead, leading up to the closure of DCC.

PROVINCE PROPOSES AMENDMENTS TO THE CREDIT UNIONS AND CAISSES POPULAIRES ACT
					  Amendments Will Enhance Oversight of  Manitoba's Credit Union Central:  Fielding


	The Manitoba government is proposing amendments to The Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act that would strengthen the regulatory framework for Credit Union Central of Manitoba (CUCM), Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“The financial services sector depends on public trust and confidence, which in turn is dependent on strong oversight and accountability framework,” said Fielding.  “We are working to establish an effective, practical system to oversee Credit Union Central of Manitoba to ensure Manitobans can continue to be confident their savings are safe in our prosperous credit unions and caisses populaires.”

	Fielding noted the federal government withdrew its oversight services of provincial credit union centrals, leaving provincial governments with sole responsibility, so this legislation would fill that gap.

	The proposed legislation would create a framework where:
	•    the Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba (DGCM) will become the primary regulator of Credit Union Central of Manitoba, in addition to its current role as primary regulator of Manitoba’s credit unions and caisses populaires;
	•    the Financial Institutions Regulation Branch of the Manitoba Financial Services Agency (Registrar) will oversee the Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba to ensure it fulfils its regulatory role and maintain responsibility for the system itself; and
	•    the Manitoba government continues to be responsible for the Manitoba Financial Services Agency.

	The minister noted the changes would ensure Manitoba’s regulatory framework meets national and international standards for the effective oversight of deposit-taking institutions, which includes monitoring solvency, liquidity, and safety and soundness.

	As of Dec. 31, 2019, there were 25 credit unions and one caisse populaire in Manitoba, with 199 branch locations and a presence in 124 Manitoba communities.  The sector’s assets were approximately $34.5 billion.  The Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba provides protection for deposits held with these institutions.

	The minister noted the Manitoba government developed the proposed legislative changes after reviewing other jurisdictions and best practices, and the new framework would resemble the SaskCentral model.

NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) BULLETIN #7


	Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) and public health officials are reminding Manitobans the risk of acquiring the novel (new) coronavirus (COVID-19) in Manitoba remains low.  

	While China remains the epicenter of the outbreak, more countries continue to report COVID-19 cases with local transmissions.  Manitoba officials continue to work closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor the situation as it evolves.

	Travellers returning from Iran and the province of Hubei, contacts of a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 or laboratory workers exposed during work are advised to self-isolate for 14 days after departing from Hubei or Iran, or since their last known contact/exposure.  For information on self-isolation visit www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/factsheets/coronavirus_selfisolation.pdf.

	All returning international travellers should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days after returning to Canada.  As the situation continues to evolve, MHSAL encourages Manitobans to review the Government of Canada’s COVID-19 related travel advisories as they consider their travel plans, which can be found at www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html.

	Travellers who develop cold or flu-like symptoms within 14 days of returning to Canada should contact Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) to determine if testing for COVID-19 should be considered.  In cases where testing is not recommended, they should self-isolate until they are well.

	As of March 5, 97 tests have been completed for COVID-19 in Manitoba.  At this time, there are no laboratory-confirmed cases here.

	Suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 are required to be reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.  Confirmed Canadian cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia.

	Common personal prevention and preparedness measures for viruses such as COVID-19 and influenza include regular hand washing with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and staying home when you are sick, regardless of recent travel.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.  For additional preparedness details visit www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/being-prepared.html.

	Being prepared also means seeking official sources of information to ensure the most up-to-date and accurate information is being used.  MHSAL is also urging media to exercise caution in reporting information related to the evolving COVID-19 situation and to avoid hearsay or speculation, as this can spread misinformation.

	Information on areas with community transmission, as well as links to information on all countries reporting COVID-19 cases, will be updated regularly.  For the most up-to-date information on COVID-19, visit Manitoba Public Health at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/diseases/coronavirus.html.

MANITOBA TO IMPLEMENT FLAT $25-PER-TONNE GREEN LEVY,  PST WILL BE REDUCED TO SIX PER CENT
					  Standing Up for Manitobans:  Pallister


Backgrounder
Background Information

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government will implement a flat $25-per-tonne Green Levy and reduce the PST to six per cent, saving Manitoba families and businesses more than a billion dollars over the next five years compared to the rising federal carbon tax, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	Both the made-in-Manitoba Green Levy and the PST reduction will come into effect on July 1.

	“Unfortunately, the federal government ignored our request to work together as a true partner in tackling climate change, so we have no choice but to act now to protect Manitobans from the rising federal government carbon tax they are bringing in this year,” said Pallister.  “Ottawa has provided special exceptions and exemptions to many other provinces but refused to consider Manitoba’s significant clean hydro investments.”

	Manitobans will come out ahead with both the flat Green Levy and lower PST.  The average Manitoba household will save $200 in 2022 through Manitoba’s flat Green Levy alone, adding up to more than $700 over the next five years, the premier said.

	The premier noted that 100 per cent of the flat Manitoba Green Levy will be returned to Manitobans.  Dropping the PST to six per cent will save Manitobans $325 million each year, $40 million more than the actual cost of the flat Manitoba carbon levy.  The average Manitoba household will save $359 in 2022 with a six per cent PST.

	“Unlike the federal government’s rising carbon tax, our flat made-in-Manitoba Green Levy will return all of the money and more to Manitobans with the second-lowest PST in Canada,” said Pallister.

	Manitoba large industrial emitters will reduce emissions through a made-in-Manitoba output-based carbon pricing system based on the flat Green Levy of $25 per tonne.

	Greenhouse-gas emissions in Manitoba will be reduced by at least two megatonnes (MT) over the five-year carbon savings account period set in legislation, a doubling of the original one MT goal fixed last June.

	“Manitobans know tackling climate change is important and we are already doing our part by investing billions in clean, green hydro,” said Pallister.  “Together with the our hydro investments, the highest clean fuel standards in the country announced in January, plus additional measures we are taking, Manitoba’s carbon emissions will be reduced by more than any previous government.  Our plan is better for the environment, better for the economy, and better for children and grandchildren.”

	Manitoba is taking strong action on climate change and implementing a flat Green Levy to replace the federal backstop carbon tax, Pallister added.

	“Manitoba has offered to be a bridge between east and west on climate and carbon and that offer still stands,” said Pallister.  “Working with us should not be a bridge too far for the federal government.”

					  Emerging Vehicle Technologies Create Business Opportunities in Manitoba:  Schuler


	The Manitoba government has introduced legislation that would allow testing of automated vehicles on provincial roads, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“Development of vehicle technology, including automated self-driving vehicles, is progressing rapidly worldwide and these changes will help make Manitoba competitive in attracting business and keeping pace with other jurisdictions,” said Schuler.  “Our government is honouring our commitment to bring forward legislative amendments that would create a framework to allow the safe testing of automated vehicles on Manitoba roads.”

	The Vehicle Technology Testing Act (Various Acts Amended) would create a framework to enable testing of vehicle technology and types including automated and connected.  Testing advanced and alternative vehicle technologies would also position the province as an attractive location for companies to test intelligent transportation infrastructure.

	Before the province can authorize testing, it would develop regulations and a permitting system this year, in consultation with stakeholders, the minister noted.

	“By enabling developers to safely test emerging vehicle technologies on provincial roadways, we are supporting Manitoba’s large agricultural, trucking, heavy vehicle manufacturing and technology development sectors,” said Schuler.  “Numerous vehicle technologies are in development and ready for testing, creating opportunities for Manitoba-based business.”

	The bill also amends The Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) Corporation Act and The Insurance Act concerning registration and insurance requirements for vehicle testing organizations.

	The decision to close DCC was not made lightly, and I understand this has been a time of change and uncertainty that has affected many people and the community of Dauphin and the Parkland region.

	I want to commend our staff at DCC and across the correctional system for continuing to serve the province and the people in our custody with dedication, professionalism and compassion.

	I am pleased to report that government has finalized an agreement with the employees’ union to offer employment to all DCC staff who wish to remain working for the Manitoba government and assistance for those who wish to explore other employment opportunities.  We have also agreed on a plan to support staff who may choose to relocate, as well as those who want to stay in Dauphin.  We worked with the union to conclude this agreement within a month from the date we informed the employees and their union of the decision.  We thank our employees for their patience with this process.

	We will continue to keep the lines of communication open with employees, the union and the community.

	The Manitoba government will work as a team to honour its commitment to Manitobans to achieve the five-point guarantee Moving Manitoba Forward that will see further tax relief, better health care sooner, more schools for students, more jobs for Manitobans, and made-in-Manitoba climate-change solutions, the premier noted.  

	The mandate letters further support the government’s ongoing commitment to be transparent and accountable to Manitobans.  Highlights of the mandate letters include:
	•    ensuring Budget 2020 has sufficient resiliency to help protect Manitobans from the effects of possible flooding and other emergencies;
	•    stabilizing the capital funding baskets to allow urban and rural municipalities to plan better;
	•    working with other levels of government to explore the feasibility of utilizing a P3 delivery model and the Canada Infrastructure Bank to finance and deliver the necessary upgrades to the City of Winnipeg’s North End Water Pollution Control Centre;
	•    championing Manitoba as an ideal location for business investment and expansion and capture new opportunities through a renewed trade strategy;
	•    developing partnerships with Indigenous communities to develop natural resources and economic infrastructure;
	•    growing the highways budget by 14 per cent to $400 million from $350 million over the next four years;
	•    advancing the redevelopment of the St. Boniface Emergency Department to strengthen Winnipeg’s emergency health services;
	•    continuing to advocate for a strengthened partnership with the federal government on funding health care;
	•    enhancing public safety and continuing the modernization of the criminal justice system;
	•    creating a $25-million Teachers’ Idea Fund to support front-line educators who propose innovative projects that improve literacy and numeracy outcomes;
	•    transforming the Employment Income Assistance (EIA) Program to a benefit that provides a short-term bridge to meaningful employment from one that encourages dependency on government;
	•    developing a new Portable Child-Care Benefit that will help lower-income families find child care;
	•    developing of a provincial trail network and enhancing recycling, composting and waste management systems;
	•    implementing on-line licensing for outdoor enthusiasts including hunters, trappers, anglers and park visitors; and
	•    enhancing the film tax credit to encourage more permanent investments in film production.

	“Our government has established Ideas Funds across all departments to encourage front-line workers to come forward with innovative ideas to modernize and improve the way we deliver the services Manitobans depend on,” said Pallister.  “We will build a better, more efficient, responsible and open government that provides quality services to all Manitobans.”

	Mandate letters for legislative assistants, the special envoy for military affairs and Crown corporations will be issued at a later date, the premier added.

	The Manitoba legislature resumes today and Budget 2020 will be delivered on March 11.  Over 20 bills are expected to be introduced during the spring session, on top of the 20 bills already introduced last fall.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT INTRODUCES NEW BUDGET ACCOUNTABILITY
					  Province Cleans Up Special Funds and Returns Collected Fees to Their Intended Purpose:  Fielding


	As part of its upcoming Budget 2020, the Manitoba government is creating greater accountability and cleaning up special funds set up by the previous government, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“As part of our plans to make Manitoba’s budgeting process more open and transparent, we discovered the previous government was collecting money from Manitobans into fake funds, yet the fees paid were not fully being used for their intended purpose,” said Fielding.  “Funds were used to understate the size of the previous government’s deficits, making them look even smaller than they actually were.  Our government’s accounting methods must be truthful and accountable to Manitobans and that is why Budget 2020 is cleaning up the mess created by these special funds.”

	As an example, Fielding mentioned the Trucking Productivity Improvement Fund, which collected fees from companies who are using trucks to carry overweight and oversized loads under the guise the fees would be used to fix wear and tear on highways caused by heavy truck traffic.  However, the fees collected were put into general revenue.

	Budget 2020 will allocate $600,000 in Manitoba Infrastructure revenue and expenditure to reflect the collected permit fees from companies and the corresponding expense to maintain provincial highways that are included in the program.  

	To clear the outstanding balance in the Trucking Productivity Improvement Fund, Manitoba Infrastructure will make a one-time, $5-million investment in road preservation and maintenance in 2020-21.

	The following special funds are in the process of being remediated to ensure those expecting benefits from the funds can rely on the money will be spent for its designated purposes:
	•    Abandonment Reserve Account,
	•    Mine Rehabilitation Reserve,
	•    Fisheries and Wildlife Enhancement Fund,
	•    Quarry Rehabilitation Reserve Account,
	•    Veterinary Sciences Scholarship Fund,
	•    Farm Machinery and Equipment Fund,
	•    Manitoba Opportunities Fund,
	•    Community Revitalization Fund,
	•    Victim’s Assistance Fund,
	•    Legal Aid,
	•    Borrowers Financial Literacy Fund,
	•    Land Titles Assurance Fund,
	•    Workplace Safety and Public Education Fund,
	•    Housing Development and Rehabilitation Fund,
	•    Fire Prevention Fund,
	•    Trucking Productivity Improvement Fund, and
	•    Waste Reduction and Recycling Support Fund.

	“There was no one-size-fits-all fix to these special funds, and care was taken on each fund to find a way to protect the stakeholders whose money went into it and ensure money is set aside for them,” said Fielding.  “We will take further legislative measures as required later this year.  In the weeks ahead, Manitobans will learn other steps we are taking to make our provincial budget process more transparent and consistent, and apply the same rules to central government and dozens of other reporting entities.”

	This year, departments will receive sufficient funds to use for their original, intended purposes and to ensure this money is spent.  Going forward, departmental budgets will be increased by an amount equal to the revenues generated by the fees, to be spent on their intended purposes by the end of fiscal year, the minister said, adding these amounts will be part of base budgets in future years.

	The provincial budget will be released March 11.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT RELEASES THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL UPDATE
					  Province Slightly Ahead of Schedule to Balance Budget:  Fielding


	The Manitoba government released its third quarter report for the 2019-20 fiscal year, which indicates the province is on the right track to financial recovery in uncertain economic times, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“Manitoba is showing continued progress toward balancing the budget and steadily reducing the deficit,” said Fielding.  “The third quarter report provides a clear picture of the fiscal year and is indicating revenues are higher than anticipated due to our resilient economy.”

	At this point, the deficit is projected to be $325 million, about $35 million ahead of the government’s target.  The province remains ahead of schedule to eliminate the deficit.

	Revenue is up $248 million compared to budget projections, mainly related to an increase in income taxes.  Expenses are also up $118 million compared to budget projections, as the forecast includes over $150 million for new green initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in debt-servicing costs.

	Fielding noted the report proves the province is delivering on the infrastructure promises made as part of Budget 2019, which committed at least $1 billion in strategic infrastructure spending on priorities such as roads and bridges, flood protection, hospitals, schools, universities and colleges.  The third quarter report forecasts $1,227 million on infrastructure spending.

	The minister noted the province continues to ensure value for money on procurement and has centralized many capital delivery functions to create efficiencies.

MANITOBA ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY SAFETY STRATEGY,  RESTORATIVE JUSTICE INITIATIVE IN THOMPSON


	THOMPSON—The Manitoba government is providing new support for a community-led safety strategy and strengthening partnerships to increase the use of restorative justice in northern Manitoba, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“Building a safer, stronger and more resilient community must be done in partnership with the people who live and work there,” said Cullen.  “We are pleased to invest in the development of a community safety strategy, led by the City of Thompson, with input from community members, Indigenous partners and stakeholders.  By working together, we can make a real difference in the safety and wellness of citizens while advancing reconciliation in Manitoba.”

	The province is providing a $35,000 grant for the City of Thompson to work with a consultant and develop a community safety and well-being strategy.  The goal is to create a tool that identifies risks and social factors that contribute to crime and victimization, identify initiatives to address these factors and set measurable outcomes.  

	“The team we’ve assembled has already been working to improve public safety and well-being in Thompson for many years, and all have a detailed understanding of Thompson’s realities, challenges and opportunities,” said Mayor Colleen Smook, City of Thompson.  “We’re excited to bring these perspectives together under a broader strategy for the benefit of Thompson and the region as a whole.”

	To help improve timely access to justice in the north, the Manitoba government has launched Restorative Justice North in partnership with the Manitoba Metis Federation (MMF) and Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO).  This pilot project brings restorative justice partners together to assess and divert matters into appropriate programs and resolve them in a more timely way.

	The minister noted the goal of Restorative Justice North is to increase the use of diversion options in Thompson. Accordingly, MKO will also develop a complementary restorative justice program for Thompson, based on their existing expertise in restorative justice.

	“MKO is hopeful that this announcement and initial investments are the beginning of utilizing culturally appropriate and Indigenous ways of being to address justice issues in the north,” said Grand Chief Garrison Settee, MKO.  “Criminal offences stem from systemic causes that require more in-depth and holistic approaches that focuses on the victim, offender and the community at large.  Without holistic approaches to address justice, the cycle continues without any benefit to the community.  Restorative justice is a step forward in addressing the impacts of colonialism.  The approach must be Indigenous led with First Nations, Inuit and Métis at the table and inputting into the design, having decision making authority and implementing from a culturally appropriate lens.”

	The Manitoba government is investing more than $2.8 million in restorative justice programs this year, an increase of $400,000 over the previous fiscal year.  This increase includes additional investments of $50,000 with both MMF and MKO.  

	The minister noted he looks forward to ongoing collaboration with the City of Thompson, MKO, MMF and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC) on these important issues.  

	“On behalf of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, I congratulate all parties involved in the restorative justice and safety pilot project for the City of Thompson,” said Grand Chief Arlen Dumas, AMC.  “The AMC supports any Manitoba Justice initiative intended to reduce the incarceration rates of our citizens in the Thompson area and elsewhere.  It is my hope that restorative justice grounded in First Nations principles will also help to reduce recidivism, support offenders, and offer alternatives, particularly for the First Nations youth in the Thompson area.”

	Every year, more than 5,000 matters are diverted out of the criminal justice system to be resolved through restorative justice and diversion programs.  Restorative justice and diversion programs have proved beneficial for addressing systemic roots causes that lead to criminal activity and create an opportunity for the offender to make amends to the victim and the community, and help reduce the likelihood of future contact with the legal system.  Individuals who participate before charges are laid can avoid the stigma of a criminal charge.

	The minister noted funding allocated for the City of Thompson’s strategy builds on $300,000 previously allocated by the province to support community safety initiatives.  This commitment was set out in the May 2019 Policing and Public Safety Strategy.  For more information, visit: www.gov.mb.ca/justice/pubs/police_publicsafety_strategy.pdf.

TRANSMISSION LINE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS AND CREATE MORE RELIABLE POWER SUPPLY


	Investing in green infrastructure is critical to protecting the environment, improving people’s lives and creating sustainable economic growth.

	Today, the Honourable Jim Carr, the prime minister’s special advisor for the Prairies, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, minister of infrastructure and communities, Central Services Minister Reg Helwer and Jay Grewal, president and CEO of Manitoba Hydro, announced funding for the Birtle Transmission Line linking Saskatchewan to Manitoba’s green, renewable energy.

	This project will help Manitoba Hydro build a 230-kilovolt transmission line from Birtle South Station in the Municipality of Prairie View to the Manitoba–Saskatchewan border 46 kilometres northwest. Once completed, the new line will allow up to 215 megawatts of renewable hydroelectricity, which is currently surplus to the needs of Manitobans, to flow from the Manitoba Hydro power grid to the SaskPower power grid.

	Increasing Manitoba’s interconnection to Western Canada’s power distribution grid will establish greater stability for energy supply, while keeping energy rates affordable for the province. Manitoba’s clean hydroelectricity is a vital element of Saskatchewan’s efforts to reduce cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions in that province.

	The Government of Canada is investing more than $18.7 million, and the government of Manitoba is contributing more than $42 million, in this project through the Green Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada Plan.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is investing $60,000 to expand the highly successful Families and Schools Together (F&ST) program, bringing the total to nine schools benefiting from the initiative, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	“The F&ST program brings multiple families together after school, once per week, so parents can learn skills necessary to care for their children and to be lovingly connected to them,” said Goertzen.  “As part of the expansion, we are also introducing the Baby F&ST program, aimed at children three years of age and under, at two sites.  Baby F&ST is a great program for young, isolated mothers in insecure family environments and challenging circumstances.”

	Goertzen noted the F&ST program has many social and educational benefits including building family resiliency and decreasing the likelihood of future drug addiction by children and current drug use by parents.  The program has been delivered in Winnipeg and various rural areas for more than 25 years by Family Dynamics, a Winnipeg-based agency.

	“Family Dynamics has been delivering the Families and Schools Together program for over two decades because we know it helps families with young children come together in a healthy and safe way,” said Steve Williams, president of the board, Family Dynamics Inc.

	F&ST is in use in 20 countries and in more than 2,000 schools around the world.  The United Nations, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada have recognized the program as an exemplary best practice.

	The funding to expand F&ST comes from the Canada-Manitoba Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement.  This is one of many initiatives undertaken by the Manitoba government to improve access to services for families struggling with mental health and addictions.

	The investment builds on recommendations made in the VIRGO report to the Manitoba government to prioritize funding for an expansion of mental health and addictions services for children and youth.

PROVINCE MAKES RECORD SEIZURE OF CONTRABAND CIGARETTES


	On the evening of Feb. 13, Manitoba Finance’s Taxation Special Investigations Unit, along with the Winnipeg Police Service, completed an investigation into the sale of contraband cigarettes at multiple retail locations in Winnipeg.

	Investigators seized 2,050,300 cigarettes not marked for Manitoba Tax purposes.  This was a potential tax loss of $615,090 for the province and is the largest single seizure in the history of the Special Investigation’s Unit.  Along with the cigarettes, the seizure included $93,230 in cash and two motor vehicles.

	Three Winnipeg residents including two adult males and an adult female now face a variety of charges under Manitoba’s Tobacco Tax Act and Tax Administration and Miscellaneous Taxes Act (TAMTA).  For a first-time offence under the provincial tax acts, individuals face fines between $1,000 and $10,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment as well as a potential triple tax penalty.  Two of accused have prior convictions, so they face more stringent penalties under TAMTA including fines between $10,000 and $50,000 and/or up to one-year imprisonment, suspensions of their driver licenses as well as a potential quadruple tax penalty of $2,460,360.  The accused will also face charges under the Criminal Code of Canada.

	The province urges anyone who has information on contraband tobacco to contact their local police department, call the Manitoba Finance Special Investigations Unit at 204-945-1137, email smuggling_manitoba@rcmp-grc.gc.ca or call Manitoba Crime Stoppers (toll-free) at1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES 2020 BUDGET DATE
					  Spending Priorities will Continue Moving Manitoba Forward:  Fielding


	After months of preparation and consultation with Manitobans, the provincial government will reveal Budget 2020 on Wednesday, March 11, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“We have compiled a fiscal plan for the year ahead that focuses on the issues that matter most to Manitobans,” said Fielding.  “Our priorities continue to be making life more affordable in our province, while strengthening the public services they depend on and building a brighter future for all Manitobans.”

	Fielding will present the budget one week after the provincial legislature resumes sitting.  He noted the province remains on the right track to financial recovery as the mid-year fiscal update for 2019-20 projected a lowered deficit of $350 million, slightly ahead of plan even after needing to address unanticipated liabilities ignored in the past.  The government remains committed to eliminating the deficit its second term.

	As part of the Budget 2020 consultation process, the province engaged more than 18,000 people across the province.  The finance minister hosted public meetings in Altona, Brandon, Flin Flon, Gimli, Steinbach, Swan River, The Pas, Thompson and Winnipeg as well as stakeholder sessions and two telephone town hall forums.

	“Budget 2020 involved our most ambitious public community consultation schedule to date, which supplied us with valuable feedback and ideas to incorporate into our spending plans,” said Fielding.  “There were many ways for Manitobans to voice their priorities, which include our shared goals of improved health care, community safety and tax relief.”

	Fielding thanked the Manitobans who emailed and mailed submissions and used the online survey and Build a Budget tool at https://engagemb.ca/Budget-2020.

PROVINCE RELEASES FIRST 2020 SPRING THAW OUTLOOK
					  Spring Weather Conditions will Determine Extent of High Water:  Schuler

Watch news conference





	Future snow and spring rain will determine the 2020 spring run-off and potential high water situations along the Red River, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler said today as he released the province’s first Spring Thaw Outlook.

	“Our focus is currently on the Red River, where we are expecting a significant inflow of water from the northern United States, but with favourable weather conditions in Manitoba, we would expect high water levels similar to last spring,” said Schuler.  “The Assiniboine River basin and other rivers are expected to remain mostly in bank, with possible over-bank high water covering agricultural land.”

	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is modelling the current conditions with possible future weather scenarios.  With favourable conditions, forecasters would expect similar water levels to 2019.  Last year, the Red River Floodway was put into service but Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 from Winnipeg south to Emerson remained open.  

	Average weather conditions in spring 2020 would result in water levels similar to 2011 on the Red River, according to forecasters.  In that year, PTH 75 was closed for 29 days.  Unfavourable weather could lead to a run-off nearing 2009 levels.  In 2009, PTH 75 was closed for 37 days.

	Schuler noted the province has invested approximately $65 million in flood mitigation measures through the Red River Valley over the past four years.  Projects include:
	•    raising northbound lanes of PTH 75 south of Morris and improving drainage (construction underway);
	•    reconstructing the Plum River bridge in the northbound lanes of PTH 75 near St. Jean Baptiste;
	•    reconstructing the Marsh River bridge on PTH 23 east of Morris; and
	•    reconstructing the Little Morris River bridge on PR 422 near Rosenfeld.  

	The Hydrologic Forecast Centre plans to release a second Spring Thaw Outlook in late March.  At that time, forecasters will have a more focused assessment of the Red River and will update the forecast based on the most current conditions at that time.

	The Red River in Manitoba is affected by flows from North Dakota and water from the Manitoba portion of the basin.  The river widens as it moves north, naturally flattens and lowers its peak as it moves downstream.

	The first 2020 Spring Thaw Outlook report is available at:

MANITOBA REAPPOINTS ONE MEMBER TO SURFACE RIGHTS BOARD


	The Manitoba government has reappointed June Greggor to the Surface Rights Board, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“The Surface Rights Board plays an important role in our province for holders of oil and gas rights,” said Pedersen.  “We’re happy to reappoint June as she brings a wide array of experience that will greatly benefit the board.”

	Greggor (Reston) served as chief administrative officer for the Rural Municipality (RM) of Pipestone from January 2000 to January 2016.  She previously served as assistant chief administrative officer for the RM of Pipestone and as a member of the Manitoba Municipal Administrators Association.  Greggor holds a certificate in Manitoba municipal administration from the University of Manitoba.

	The Surface Rights Board is an independent, quasi-judicial board established under The Surface Rights Act.  The board arbitrates disputes relating to right of entry or compensation for surface rights used by holders of oil and gas rights.  It also provides mediation services between surface owners, occupants and oil and gas rights holders on a voluntary basis.

	The minister noted this appointment is part of the Manitoba government’s efforts to continue to refresh the agencies, boards and commissions of the province, ensuring that Manitobans continue to be represented in these important positions by highly qualified and enthusiastic individuals.

MANITOBA CONTRIBUTES $1.5 MILLION TO UPDATE OAK HAMMOCK MARSH INTERPRETIVE CENTRE


	The Manitoba government is providing a matching contribution of up to $1.5 million to support wetland education and conservation through a campaign to renovate the award-winning Oak Hammock Marsh Interpretive Centre, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen has announced.

	“Oak Hammock Marsh is recognized as a wetland of international importance and its interpretive centre helps visitors to better understand why, while bringing wildlife and people together,” said Pedersen.  “We’re pleased to support the capital campaign to renovate the centre, to ensure Manitobans and visitors from around the world can continue to connect with nature, enjoy and respect Manitoba’s wild areas and learn why we all depend on wetlands.”

	The minister announced Manitoba’s contribution at Ducks Unlimited Canada’s 24th annual Minister’s Dinner yesterday.  The fundraising event brings together more than 230 people in support of the Oak Hammock Marsh Interpretive Centre and its wetland education programs.  The province has committed to $1.5 million in matching funds if $3 million is raised in support of the interpretive centre project.  This funding is in addition to the $225,000 in annual operating funding the interpretive centre receives from the Manitoba government.

	Upgrades to the interpretive centre will be guided by a comprehensive plan that re-imagines the space.  Renovations and enhancements will focus on creatively and strategically highlighting the natural surroundings while leveraging innovative and interactive educational tools. 

	“The opportunity to enhance our space and visitor experience is exciting,” says Karla Guyn, CEO for Ducks Unlimited Canada.  “Since the interpretive centre was built more than 25 years ago, it has provided students and visitors with unique ways to learn about the natural world.  We look forward to finding new ways of connecting people with wetlands within an updated facility.”

	Open year-round, the interpretive centre is used by school groups and tourists and offers a variety of guided programs.  It also features a theatre, a scenic cafe, a gift shop, meeting rooms, rooftop observation deck and interactive exhibits.

	Spearheaded by Harry Enns, former minister of natural resources, and Claude Wilson, former president of Ducks Unlimited Canada, the interpretive centre first opened its doors in 1993.  Since then, Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Manitoba government have worked together to manage the interpretive centre.

	Located east of Stonewall, Oak Hammock Marsh is a 36-square-kilometre marsh that features a restored prairie marsh, aspen-oak bluff, artesian springs and some of Manitoba’s last remaining patches of tall-grass prairie.  Its interpretive centre welcomes close to 100,000 students, tourists and environmental professionals annually who can explore 30 kilometres of trails and lush natural habitat that is home to 25 species of mammals, 300 species of birds, numerous amphibians, reptiles, fish and invertebrates.

MANITOBA SHERIFFS TO EXPAND ROLE IN TRANSPORTING INMATES, PROVIDING COURT SECURITY IN EASTERN MANITOBA
					  Added Sheriff Services Will Help Increase Police Presence in Eastern Manitoba:  Cullen

Watch news conference





	More police officers will be patrolling communities in eastern Manitoba as provincial sheriff’s officers take on full responsibility for transporting inmates to court and providing court security in the region, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“Our government is finding ways to help free up police resources and ensure police officers are able to actively patrol our communities and focus their efforts on crime prevention, intervention and investigation,” said Cullen.  “Sheriff’s officers are already responsible for inmate transportation and court security in other regions and handle their duties with dedication and professionalism.  It is a wise investment to expand their responsibility into eastern Manitoba as part of our broader commitment to public safety.”

	The Manitoba government will invest nearly $2.5 million annually to hire 11 sheriff’s officers in the eastern district and assume responsibility for transportation-related costs, which will include several fleet vehicles as well as flights to communities only accessible by air.  Sheriff’s officers will assume responsibility for transporting inmates to and from circuit court locations in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) eastern district and will also provide security at these locations.  In the past, RCMP officers have been responsible for providing these services.  The transition is expected to be complete in the next six months.

	“Our focus is to keep front-line RCMP officers actively patrolling our rural communities and responding quickly to calls for service,” said Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy, commanding officer of the Manitoba RCMP.  “The addition of 11 sheriff’s officers to transport prisoners and provide court security will ensure that RCMP officers are doing their core policing work and are there for when Manitobans need them most.”

	The eastern district is bounded by Garden Hill in the north, east to the Manitoba-Ontario border, south to the American border and to the east side of Lake Manitoba.  It includes communities such as Altona, Arborg, Berens River, Emerson, Garden Hill, Gimli, Little Grand Rapids, Peguis, Powerview-Pine Falls, Selkirk, St-Pierre-Jolys, Steinbach and Stonewall. 

	Sheriff’s officers are currently responsible for inmate transports and courtroom security in western Manitoba and Winnipeg, and for inmate transportation in the north.  RCMP continue to provide court security in northern Manitoba.

	The minister noted this investment supports the goals of the province’s Policing and Public Safety Strategy and the Safer Streets, Safer Lives Strategy, as it reduces extraneous demands on police resources and ensures RCMP officers are able to focus on front-line policing services in their communities.

	The province continues to support other initiatives that reduce extraneous demands on police resources, which helps ensure more officers are actively serving their communities, the minister noted.  For example, amendments to The Provincial Offences Act came into effect in 2017 to allow written evidence to be submitted to the court by police officers, instead of having to attend hearings and present their evidence in person.  As a result, court attendance by police officers, including Winnipeg Police Service, the RCMP and other police services, has significantly decreased.

	The Manitoba government also recently announced plans to invest $1.9 million to support the expansion of RCMP crime reduction and enforcement teams including a five-member unit for the eastern district.  Crime reduction teams focus on serious, prolific offenders and drug dealers.  The province’s investment will establish a new five-member team in the eastern district, a new five-member team in the western district and support the expansion of an existing northern team.  Additional officers will also join the D Division Enforcement Team, a centralized unit targeting criminal organizations and street gangs that traffic drugs and guns throughout the province.

	The decision to shift transportation and court security responsibilities to sheriff’s officers also builds on the strategic direction set out under Manitoba’s Criminal Justice System Modernization Strategy, which focuses on crime prevention and improving service delivery.

THOMPSON TO HOST NEW FAMILY MEDICINE TRAINING PROGRAM IN NORTHERN MANITOBA
					  Program Will Aid Physician Recruitment Efforts in the North:  Friesen


	A new family medicine residency program in Thompson will allow medical residents to experience northern and remote health-care service delivery and encourage physician recruitment and retention to underserved areas across the large and diverse region, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Providing a program that lets physicians experience life in the north and how people in the region access health care is an excellent way to prepare them for a career in northern medicine,” said Friesen.  “Following the success of similar programs in the other health regions, this new partnership between the University of Manitoba and the Northern Regional Health Authority will support stronger recruitment and retention efforts across northern Manitoba.”

	Upon graduation from medical school, graduates take residency training as family physicians or in a specialty.  The two-year family medicine residency program in the Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Science at the University of Manitoba, includes training in a number of practice areas, such as primary care, psychiatry, obstetrics, general surgery, internal medicine, emergency department care, pediatrics and seniors care.  This training allows family physicians to meet the varied health-care needs of Manitobans in communities across the province.

	The minister noted similar residency programs have proven successful in recruitment and retention of physicians in other regions such as Prairie Mountain Health and Southern Health-Santé Sud.  Most recently, Selkirk became a site for family medicine residency training in the Interlake-Eastern health region in 2019.

	“We’re excited to be expanding into the northern health region with residents living and working in Thompson,” said Dr. José François, medical director of Shared Health’s family medicine program, and head of the Department of Family Medicine at the Max Rady College of Medicine.  “This new site offers residents an opportunity to absorb the rewards of a northern practice and setting while meeting the diverse needs of the communities in and around Thompson.”

	While the program is based out of Thompson, trainees will complete core training rotations across the region, preparing residents to provide care across diverse environments including community hospitals, health centres, nursing stations and care homes in First Nation, rural and remote communities.

	Addressing the unique health needs and inequities of Indigenous populations in the region is a core skill for family physicians working in the north.  The 2016 census data shows that 71 per cent of the people living in the northern health region self-identify as Indigenous.

	The university has redistributed two of its seats from the family medicine northern and remote stream residency program basing it in Thompson.  Medical residents will be selected for these training opportunities through the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) for positions beginning in July 2020.

	The residency program provides an excellent opportunity for trainees to gain effective cultural safety proficiency, become involved in advocacy and self-reflection by learning alongside preceptors, education partners, knowledge keepers, local leaders and the patients of the Northern Regional Health Authority.

	“We believe this program will help physicians better understand the opportunities they can find while practising in northern Manitoba,” said Helga Bryant, chief executive officer Northern Regional Health Authority.  “Our medical teams are very excited to provide training opportunities for new physicians, while enhancing access to care for northern residents.”

MANITOBA INFRASTRUCTURE URGES MANITOBANS TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS ON WATERWAYS
					  Provincial Operations Underway on Assiniboine and Red Rivers


	Manitoba Infrastructure is urging people to be careful while venturing onto all rivers and streams in the province at this time of year, as temperature fluctuations could result in ice that is thinner than expected.

	Manitoba’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is reporting the outflow from Shellmouth Reservoir is gradually decreasing as part of normal operations to maintain the desired spring and summer level on the reservoir.

	The current outflow is being reduced to 100 cubic feet per second (cfs) from 500 cfs, which will result in a two-to-three foot water level decrease on the Assiniboine River from Shellmouth to the town of Russell, and one to two ft. from Russell to Brandon.  The decrease will amount to between zero and one ft. as the lower river flow reaches Winnipeg in about two weeks.

	The province will continue to monitor conditions on the upper Assiniboine River, as well as downstream river levels, and may revise the outflow if conditions change.   

	Meanwhile, the ice-jam mitigation program has started on the Red River north of Winnipeg.  Ice cutting is underway, with the Amphibex fleet and support equipment being transported north of Selkirk to begin the first section of icebreaking near Netley Lake today.

	The construction of the Lake Manitoba / Lake St. Martin Outlet Channels is one of our government’s top priorities.

	We are committed to continuing a meaningful and respectful consultation process with Indigenous communities who will be affected by this important climate-change mitigation project.

	Building positive, respectful and inclusive partnerships with Indigenous people and communities is fundamental to enhancing and increasing Indigenous participation in Manitoba’s economy, and it is also critically important for advancing reconciliation through a principled approach.

	Manitoba has engaged with all 39 Indigenous communities and groups that are potentially impacted; we have 1,083 individual records of communication and have held 139 meetings with Indigenous communities and groups in regards to this project.  The Manitoba government has already spent more than $650,000 on engagement and consultation.

	Currently, we are working with the federal government through a conformity review process regarding the Environmental Impact Statement.  Once the federal government approves the statement, the project will be advanced to the technical review stage and the next phase of consultation will begin.

	Manitoba is in the process of signing consultation agreements with communities for this next phase, and to date, has signed consultation agreements with Lake St. Martin First Nation and the following Interlake Reserves Tribal Council (IRTC) communities:  Dauphin River First Nation, Lake Manitoba First Nation and Kinonjeoshetoegon First Nation.  Six more agreements are currently being finalized.

	This next phase will build upon our ongoing dialogue with communities and will follow the requirements laid out in both provincial and federal consultation processes.

	We are committed to getting this project built, and we are committed to doing so in a way that respects and meaningfully engages Indigenous communities in consultation.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	One of the largest and most significant initiatives in Manitoba’s health system, a master capital plan, will be developed for Health Sciences Centre (HSC) Winnipeg’s campus.  The plan will ensure clinical services and partner organizations are well aligned throughout the site’s future development, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“HSC is Manitoba’s hospital and is the province’s tertiary centre for trauma, transplants, burns, neurosciences, complex cancer care, and delivers the most specialized care for adults and children,” said Friesen.

	The master plan will include an inventory of campus facilities and clinical services, and will consider what shifts in the location of specific clinical services will support the site’s ability to meet both current and future population needs.

	“Our government is making significant capital investments at HSC including the new Ambulatory Care Clinic, the opening of Women’s Hospital, the Acute Stroke Unit and the Mental Health Crisis Response Centre.  Therefore, it is essential to have the comprehensive view of the development of the campus,” said Friesen.

	Partner organizations across the HSC campus along with the Health Sciences Centre Foundation, CancerCare Manitoba Foundation and Children’s Hospital Foundation will be consulted as part of the process to ensure the long-term capital needs of all stakeholders including Cadham Provincial Laboratory, CancerCare Manitoba and the University of Manitoba are considered in the development of the overall plan, Friesen added.

	The HSC campus encompasses 39 acres of land with more than four million square feet of occupied space.  Its boundaries are Notre Dame Avenue to the south, Sherbrook Street to the east, William Avenue to the north and Tecumseh Street to the west.

	“Any campus redevelopment must take into account the priorities and population health needs of Manitobans,” said Dr. Brock Wright, president and CEO, Shared Health.  “A longer-term approach to the clinical services we provide and the physical infrastructure we share with our partners will ensure that we are able to meet the needs of Manitoba patients, both today and into the future.”

	The minister noted this will be the first in a series of master planning efforts for the health-care system and aligns with the work of the provincial clinical plan.

	“Unlike the former government, we recognize the importance of thoughtful, long-term planning, particularly in health care,” said Friesen.  “These reviews will look at changes in health-care delivery models to ensure we are working together as a province to provide better health care sooner for all Manitobans.”

MANITOBA LAUNCHES FIRST STEP IN FORAGE INSURANCE REVIEW


	Consultations with forage and livestock producers and organizations to review and shape Manitoba’s forage insurance programming are now available online, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“Manitoba forage producers have had back-to-back challenging production years and only a small proportion of forage acres are insured when compared to annual crops,” Pedersen said.  “To bridge that gap, we need to better understand the risks, challenges and effectiveness of the current program to help ensure it meets their needs over the longer term.”

	Producers have the opportunity to provide their thoughts on the current program and suggest changes that will support growth of Manitoba’s livestock sector through an online survey on https://engagemb.ca/.  Contributions will help inform government on how the current forage insurance platform is being used, its limitations and what changes need to be considered.

	The review will include a number of in-person engagement sessions in March to build on the dialogue.  The consultant for the review will work with producers and associations to identify priorities to be considered when developing or redesigning the forage insurance platform.  

	To take part in the online survey, visit the Forage Insurance Review at https://engagemb.ca/forage-insurance-review or visit one of the public kiosks available at the following Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development locations and contact the office to schedule an appointment:  
	•    Vita – 108 Main St. N, 204-425-5050;

Watch news conference





	Premier Brian Pallister and Grand Chief Arlen Dumas, Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC), today signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to formalize discussions toward an agreement on the transfer of the province’s northern airports and marine operations to First Nations ownership and operation.

	“The Manitoba government continues to support the creation of First Nations-led partnerships and ventures and this is the first formal step in developing a viable ownership model and sustainable business plan for a First Nations-led northern airports authority,” said Pallister. “Such an agreement would give First Nations independence in controlling the transportation infrastructure they depend on daily and benefit northern economies. This is a critical step toward furthering true reconciliation in Manitoba.”

	The province’s Northern Airports and Marine Operations (NAMO) has a network of 23 airports and five marine facilities. The network covers an area of Manitoba from Selkirk north to Sayisi Dene First Nation and from Brochet east to Shamattawa First Nation. The northern airports and ferry infrastructure provides a lifeline for remote communities, as it enables the transportation of medical patients, essential supplies such as food and medication, and provincial service staff from several departments.

	Throughout the negotiation process, the premier committed to maintaining this vital service at current or improved levels, and finding a solution that ensures uninterrupted, reliable and cost-effective services for all Manitobans who rely on them.

	“The AMC leadership has been resolute for many years on the need for improved transport infrastructure, including air services, for our First Nations across our traditional territories,” said Dumas. “Discussions with government officials and representatives from the private sector on the creation of a Manitoba First Nations Airport Authority represent a critical first step towards First Nations control of air transport and marine infrastructure. On behalf of the AMC, I commend the premier and Province of Manitoba for their efforts at strengthening our relationship through economic reconciliation.”

	Building on the sale of Grace Lake Airport near The Pas to Missinippi Airways in 2019, the province expanded its discussions with Indigenous partners through the AMC to consider transferring assets, ownership and operations of NAMO to the jurisdiction of Manitoba’s First Nations.

	“The Barren Lands First Nation welcomes this important announcement as a sign of good faith by the Province of Manitoba,” said Chief John Clarke. “I applaud my colleagues within the AMC leadership for their vision and determination for First Nations-led transport independence, and recognize the political will of the government of Manitoba for joining us at the discussion table for joint planning on the way forward for Manitoba First Nations air transport infrastructure.”    

	The province and AMC will work diligently in the coming months in hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with a smooth transition of assets beginning this summer.

	Information on AMC is available at https://manitobachiefs.com/.

PROVINCE INVESTS IN CLEAN WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE


	PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE—The Manitoba government will provide more than $61 million to support the upgrade of the City of Portage la Prairie’s Water Pollution Control Facility, Premier Brian Pallister announced here today.

	“The area around Portage la Prairie has seen new and established agri-business investments in the community, leading to direct job creation and ongoing population growth that is expected to continue,” said Pallister.  “This investment will bring waste-water treatment for the city and surrounding areas into compliance with provincial and federal regulations, and will benefit Manitoba’s lakes and waterways.  Our government anticipates the positive long-term contributions this investment will bring to the region.”

	The City of Portage la Prairie owns and operates the Water Pollution Control Facility, a waste-water treatment plant that provides treatment for municipal and industrial waste water before it is discharged into the Assiniboine River.  The facility also serves the region’s agri-business industry, which includes pea processing plants Nutri-Pea Ltd. and Roquette and a potato-processing plant operated by McCain Foods.

	“Upgrades to Portage la Prairie’s Water Pollution Control Facility will modernize waste-water infrastructure for the local community, safeguarding the well-being of Manitoba’s families and will support the area’s growing agri-business functions,” said Mayor Irvine Ferris, City of Portage la Prairie.  “Investing in the expansion of Portage la Prairie’s waste-water infrastructure provides an exciting opportunity to improve our environmental footprint and support the unprecedented economic growth in the area.”

	The premier noted that historic partnerships with these major industry leaders in food processing have resulted in unparalleled investment to the province’s agricultural industry, creating jobs, establishing stronger markets for Canadian farmers and providing a significant boost to Manitoba’s economy.

	The Manitoba government continues to deliver strategic investments in community infrastructure to help facilitate growth and improve quality of life in the province. By improving waste-water management, the City of Portage la Prairie and service areas will be better able to meet federal and provincial waste-water regulations and provide a cleaner environment to the area’s existing and future population.

	Funding for the expansion of the facility is being provided through the Investing in Canada Plan. Other partners in the project include the Government of Canada and the City of Portage la Prairie, which are providing more than $60 million and $59 million respectively.

	Construction is expected to begin in summer 2022, the premier added.

MANITOBA SEES LARGEST MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT INCREASE IN MORE THAN A DECADE
					  6,500 More Manitobans Working in January Shows Government is Moving Manitoba Forward: Pallister

Watch news conference





	There were approximately 6,500 more Manitobans working in January than the month prior, new monthly employment statistics show, resulting in the province’s largest month-over-month increase in more than a decade, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“The latest employment numbers indicate the highest employment growth in the province since April 2008, evidence that our government is moving Manitoba forward,” said Pallister. “We continue to create a business-friendly environment and our plan to grow the private sector for the benefit of all Manitobans is working.”

	According to the latest figures from Statistics Canada, the increase in employment in January was accompanied by a decline in Manitoba’s unemployment rate to 5.1 per cent, down from 5.3 per cent in 2019. Manitoba now has the second-lowest unemployment rate in Canada.

	The province’s labour force has increased by 1.1 per cent, while the country’s rate as a whole increased by 0.1 per cent.

	Manitoba is a leader with amongst the highest per-capita private-sector investment growth across the country, according to Statistics Canada. The premier noted the growth and business confidence in Manitoba shows the success of the government’s Economic Growth Action Plan, a plan to create 40,000 jobs in the province over the next four years.

	The new provincial Economic Development Office is emphasizing teamwork, improved co-ordination, reduced duplication and the elimination of red tape to help create clear pathways for investors and entrepreneurs.

	“The premier has led the way in the fight to break down siloes, reduce trade barriers and lower taxes, and our government continues to create a business-friendly environment that has led to the largest month-over-month employment increase in Manitoba in more than 10 years,” said Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler. “We continue to remove obstacles to economic growth and investment to move Manitoba forward.”

	Manitoba’s employment level increased by 6,500, which amounts to a one per cent increase, above the 0.2 per cent increase for the rest of the country as a whole. Full-time employment in Manitoba grew by about 1,500 in January.

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY SERVICES EXPANDING TO SELKIRK
					  Addition of Cardiac Scans Reflects Government's Commitment to Offer Specialized Services Outside of Winnipeg: Friesen

Watch news conference





	SELKIRK—Echocardiography services will be offered at the Selkirk Regional Health Centre starting next week, allowing residents living in the region to access care closer to home while continuing to reduce province-wide wait times for the diagnostic scan, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“We are committed to providing better health care sooner for all Manitobans,” said Friesen. “Adding echocardiography services in Selkirk will build on our work to improve wait times, and allow more patients in the Interlake region to obtain this specialized service where they live.”

	Almost 3,000 patients per year from the Interlake region travel to Winnipeg to receive echocardiograms. Nearly 24 per cent of residents in the region live with hypertension, higher than the provincial average of 20.7 per cent, making the new site an ideal location for the service to be expanded.

	Echocardiograms provide an ultrasound for the heart and can offer a timely diagnosis for various forms of heart disease. Once fully operational, up to 1,620 scans per year will be performed at the new site, which will begin accepting patients this Wednesday.

	All scans performed in Selkirk will be non-urgent and elective, with the results interpreted by cardiologists at Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg (HSC). Urgent or complex scans will continue to be referred to HSC or St. Boniface Hospital.

	“This community-led initiative builds upon our health system’s capacity to offer specialized services outside of Winnipeg and addresses a regional need for this service,” said Ron van Denakker, chief executive officer, Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority (IERHA). “We are pleased that the Rotary Club of Selkirk worked with us as they undertook their Project Echo fundraising campaign to help more patients receive this service closer to home.”

	Adding echocardiography services in Selkirk is only the latest in a sustained effort by the Manitoba government to improve provincial wait times for non-urgent and elective scans, the minister noted. Last spring, seven cardiac sonographer positions were added at HSC and St. Boniface Hospital, which has reduced non-urgent and elective wait times by more than 33 per cent since May 2019.

	“Echocardiograms are important tests that assist in the diagnosis of various heart conditions,” said Dr. Brock Wright, chief executive officer, Shared Health. “Expanding the service to Selkirk will align with recommendations made in Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan to build up local capacity for specialized services and enable rural and northern patients the ability to receive the care they need without having to travel to Winnipeg.”

	Shared Health and the IERHA have hired a full-time cardiac sonographer and clerk to support the new unit, which will be located in previously-unused space at the newly-constructed health centre.

	The Rotary Club of Selkirk raised approximately $200,000 to purchase the medical equipment required to bring echocardiography services to the region. Eleven different municipalities throughout the health region contributed to the project, as did 31 community groups, local businesses, Hutterite colonies and dozens of individuals.

	“The continued improvement of health services is important to all Manitobans, including those of us who live in the Interlake-Eastern RHA,” said Jean Oliver, vice-president of the Rotary Club of Selkirk and co-chair of Project Echo. “We are thrilled to partner on this meaningful initiative that will have a positive impact on the heart health of Interlake-Eastern communities and all Manitobans.”

	Manitoba has seen recent success in other specialized services. Wait times for hip and knee replacements and cardiac surgeries have reduced significantly since the fall of 2018, when the government invested an additional $5.3 million to perform additional procedures.  Since that time, wait times for hip and knee surgeries have improved by more than 21 per cent year-over-year. Similarly, waits for cataract surgeries have improved province-wide.

MANITOBA INVESTS IN RESEARCH PROJECT TO SUPPORT HEALTH SYSTEM DECISION-MAKING DATA NEEDS
					  Project to Ensure Health System Has Access to Quality Data to Support Patients, Ensure Quality Care: Friesen


	The Manitoba government is investing more than $2.4 million over four years for three applied research projects to enhance real-time access to the data health-care providers need to make informed decisions when caring for patients, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Health-care providers need timely access to information so we can maximize the benefits and deliver better health care sooner for Manitobans,” said Friesen.  “Investing in this research will help us find ways to ensure clinical providers have access to the data they need to make more informed decisions about patient care, which supports the implementation of Manitoba’s provincial clinical and preventive services plan.”

	This project also receives funding support through Canada’s Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) Rewarding Success initiative. The Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) and the province of Manitoba will each invest $600,000 annually over four years to support work on the project.

	“This project demonstrates the power of research in improving the health of Canadians and enhancing the health care experience for patients while making health care systems more effective and efficient,” said Dr. Tammy Clifford, vice president, research programs, CIHR. “This is an excellent example of a collaborative effort supported through our SPOR program.”
	 
	Three physicians at the University of Manitoba are leading the project, each focusing on a different area of health care and how timely access to data can be used to:
	• create efficiencies to reduce the need for blood transfusions and ensure appropriate care is provided during surgeries;
	• enhance the use of home dialysis to ensure care is delivered closer to home for rural patients; and
	• enhance navigation to health care for cancer patients to ensure timely access to care, particularly in rural and northern Manitoba.

	“Mindset, the Manitoba integrated data platform, will transform how patients and providers access, and are informed by, health data,” said team lead Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, associate professor of medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine and senior scientist, Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology. “Developed with diverse stakeholders, including patients and the Government of Manitoba and the federal government, the province-wide platform will be the first of its kind in Canada and transformational for our province. It will help promote the efficient functioning and sustainability of our health system and will improve the lives of all Manitobans.”

	The minister noted these projects will inform how data is collected and used in real time as the province’s health-system transformation moves forward.

	“As we develop one system for data collection, information management and analysis, it’s important to find out what kind of data is needed and how it can be provided in more timely ways so that we can support patients and ensure quality care,” said Friesen. “This project will guide our investments in this area in the months and years ahead and allow us to maximize the benefits as we continue to transform the health care system, and provide Manitobans what they have long deserved, better health care sooner.”

	The SPOR Rewarding Success initiative was established in 2017 to address complex health problems. The initiative provides funding in a way similar to social impact bonds, where a portion of any economic benefits from research projects are reinvested to conduct further research studies.

	Anglers will not need an angling licence to try their luck during this year’s Winter Family Fishing Weekend from Feb. 15 to 17, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“There are endless fishing opportunities to be found throughout Manitoba, and ice fishing is a great way to spend time with friends and family outdoors,” said Pedersen.  “We encourage all Manitobans and visiting anglers to take advantage of our amazing fisheries free of charge.”

	Anglers will be able to fish without a licence provincewide except in national parks where a federal licence will still be required.  Conservation limits apply to those fishing without a licence.  Anglers should be sure conditions are safe before venturing onto the ice.  It is important to let someone know where you are fishing and to wear appropriate clothing so the ice-fishing experience will be enjoyable.

	Manitobans are reminded that when fishing in an Aquatic Invasive Species Control Zone, all live bait must be discarded before leaving the shoreline.  Commercially supplied dead bait that has not come into contact with water from a waterbody in an Aquatic Invasive Species Control Zone can be retained by anglers for future use.  More information on aquatic invasive species ca be found at:
www.manitoba.ca/StopAIS.

	Pedersen noted the province is also offering free park entry for the entire month of February.  Vehicle permits are not required in any provincial park.

PROVINCE LAUNCHES $3-MILLION FLOOD PROTECTION PROGRAM FOR MUNICIPALITIES


	The Manitoba government is offering support to municipalities to enhance spring flooding preparations and protections, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires announced today.

	“We want to help municipalities take steps to prevent the kind of significant damage flooding can cause to their communities,” Squires said.  “Municipalities know best what will work for them and this program is designed to help them ensure protection put in place this year will benefit their communities for many years to come.”

	Under the program, municipalities can be reimbursed for up to 100 per cent of approved flood preparedness or resiliency projects and equipment costs.  The maximum funding available for each municipality will be based on the total value of all approved proposals, but up to $150,000 may be available for each municipal proposal.  Consideration will be given for funding of up to $500,000 for the City of Winnipeg should flood risk warrant additional investment.

	“The Association of Manitoba Municipalities (AMM) welcomes the provincial government’s investment to enhance municipal capacity when responding to flood threats,” said Ralph Groening, president, AMM.  “This funding support saves money in avoided flood damages, helps municipalities better prepare, and also builds resiliency for future floods.”

	“It’s great to see programs like this offer incentives for preparedness,” said Colleen Sklar, executive director, Winnipeg Metropolitan Region (WMR).  “This kind of co-ordinated effort, with the inclusion of groups such as AMM and WMR, is critical to flood prevention and protection for years to come.”

	Proposals will be reviewed by a panel made up of representatives from the Association of Manitoba Municipalities, Winnipeg Metropolitan Region and the province.  Evaluation of proposals will consider factors including flood risk, ability of the proposal to enhance emergency preparedness or resiliency for future flood events, as well as potential regional benefits.  Proposals must be submitted by Feb. 28.

MANITOBA ACCEPTS HIGHEST NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS IN PROVINCE'S HISTORY


	The number of immigrant landings in Manitoba in 2019 reached 18,905, the highest for any year in the province’s 150-year history, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“As a significant driver of economic and population growth, immigration is shaping the future of this province.  It is a critical tool in Manitoba’s Economic Growth Action Plan to ensure we reach our goal of creating 40,000 jobs over the next four years, moving Manitoba forward,” said Eichler.  “The historic number of immigrant landings in our province last year includes 12,545 arrivals through the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program, which our government has improved and streamlined to greatly reduce a backlog of applications with dedicated resources and increased admission spaces.”

	New year-end federal immigration data shows the record-breaking number in 2019 represents 5.5 per cent of Canada’s admissions of immigrants that year.  The Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program is the primary pathway for 65 per cent of immigrants to the province.

	Close to 75 per cent of newcomers who land in Manitoba are of working age and contribute significantly to Manitoba’s labour force growth.  Within the past five years, 88 per cent of the labour force growth in the province has resulted directly from immigration in response to Manitoba’s increasing demand for workers.

	Many Manitoba employers and growing industries such as information technology are increasingly reliant on expertise and talent from outside Canada, as the worker-to-retiree ratio narrows and birth rates stabilize or fall.

	“By working in collaboration with the business community, post-secondary institutions, other levels of government and invested stakeholders, Manitoba will continue to spur innovation while developing a competitive edge, growing and attracting top talent domestically and abroad,” said Eichler.  “Immigration will continue to bring newcomers to the province and build a thriving economy for all Manitobans.”

STANDING HEARING FOR INQUEST INTO DEATH OF CHAD WILLIAMS


	A standing hearing will take place to determine who can participate in the upcoming inquest into the death of Chad Williams, 26, of Winnipeg.

	On the evening on Jan. 11, 2019, Williams was approached by Winnipeg Police Service officers and was chased on foot.  At the end of the pursuit, the officers confronted Williams, who produced a weapon and was shot by police.  Winnipeg Fire and Paramedic Service was called and police began resuscitation efforts until they arrived.  Williams received treatment at Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg but died in the early morning of Jan. 12, 2019.

	Under The Fatality Inquiries Act, an inquest has been called by the chief medical examiner.  Inquests explore the circumstances and events leading to deaths for the purpose of finding out what, if anything, might be done to prevent similar deaths in the future.

	Before the inquest begins, the judge will decide who can participate in the process and question witnesses.  Individuals and groups may make an application to be granted standing and participate in the inquest.  Those interested in applying for standing should contact Jeannelle Allard, inquest counsel, at 204-726-6013 or jeannelle.allard@gov.mb.ca by March 23.

	The standing hearing will be held on April 6 at 10 a.m. in courtroom 408 at the Manitoba Law Courts Complex, 408 York Ave., Winnipeg.

PROVINCE LAUNCHING RESEARCH PROJECT TO REDUCE WILDLIFE PREDATION OF LIVESTOCK
					  More than 2,000 Livestock Lost Annually Due to Predation:  Pedersen


	The Manitoba government is launching a three-year applied research project to identify and test ways to reduce economic loss from wildlife predation of cattle and sheep herds, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“Wildlife predation of commercial livestock is a significant problem for Manitoba producers, with more than 2,000 commercial animals lost each year,” said Pedersen.  “This results in significant economic losses to producers, as well as higher costs to Manitobans through their share of compensation under the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program funded by the federal and provincial governments.”

	The Manitoba government will provide a grant up to $300,000 over three years for the Livestock Predation Prevention Project, which will be developed and led by the Livestock Predation Protection Working Group.  Members of the group include Manitoba Beef Producers, Manitoba Sheep Association, Manitoba Goat Association, Manitoba Trappers Association, Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development, Manitoba Agricultural Services Corporation, and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

	“Manitoba Beef Producers has long advocated for strategies to reduce the risk of negative wildlife-livestock interaction and conflict, and we are pleased to see this important project moving forward,” said Dianne Riding, president, Manitoba Beef Producers.  “Predation-related challenges pose a significant concern for Manitoba’s livestock producers, who pride themselves on providing quality animal care and husbandry.  This project will help improve the understanding of the risks, and work toward developing effective prevention and mitigation methods to reduce future losses.”

	The project’s key activities will be:
	•    conducting on-farm predation risk assessments and planning in consultation with producers,
	•    testing on-farm predation prevention and removal practices, and
	•    sharing information with producers about management practices and research project results.

	Pedersen noted the research project will target the highest-known predation areas and emerging problem areas.  Currently, the highest incidence of predation is in the northern Interlake and Parkland regions.

	The governments of Canada and Manitoba currently provide compensation to affected producers through the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program, up to a maximum of $3,000 per animal.  This program has paid producers an average of more than $1.8 million annually in compensation in recent years.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON PORTAGE OVERPASS REPLACEMENT


	The provincial government is hosting a public open house to review options for a new overpass west of Portage la Prairie at the Trans-Canada Highway and Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 1A, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“This traffic exchange is a key part of the Trans-Canada Highway network, an important route for Manitoba’s economy and tourism,” said Schuler.  “The deteriorating bridge has exceeded its design life at 50 years old and needs to be replaced to ensure vehicles will pass through the area in a safe and timely manner.”

	The open house is scheduled for 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 26 at Stride Place, 245 Royal Rd. South in Portage la Prairie.

	The session will give motorists and residents the opportunity to discuss safety enhancements, potential access modifications and temporary detours, as well as land-use plans and development in the municipality and surrounding area.

	In March 2018, the province announced plans to replace the bridge, built in 1968 as part of the Trans-Canada Highway bypass around Portage la Prairie.  The low structure is below modern height standards and several vehicles have collided with the bridge in recent years.  Damage has reduced traffic to one lane over the bridge and diverted vehicles through the city route.

	The province is developing a new overpass design that will improve traffic operations, enhance safety at ramp entrances and exists, and resolve operational and safety issues.

	Manitoba Infrastructure is planning a second open house in early April to present its preferred design alternative and is conducting a public engagement process with local governments, impacted landowners and stakeholders.

	The province plans complete its interchange study later this spring, the minister said, adding construction is planned for June 2021 to November 2022.

NOVEL CORONAVIRUS BULLETIN #2

Watch news conference





	Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living and public health officials are reminding Manitobans that the risk of getting the novel coronavirus in Manitoba remains low.  Manitoba officials continue to work closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor the situation as it evolves.

	As of Feb. 5, 10 tests have been completed for the novel coronavirus in Manitoba.  At this time, there are no laboratory-confirmed cases here.

	Suspected and confirmed cases of novel coronavirus are required to be reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.  To date, five cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in Canada.  All confirmed cases are in Ontario and British Columbia.

	In light of the evolving knowledge of the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus, PHAC is recommending that travellers who have been in the province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, self-isolate for 14 days following arrival in Canada.  PHAC is also recommending that travellers returning from the rest of mainland China self-monitor for 14 days following arrival in Canada.

	Early evidence indicates the novel coronavirus can cause a range of mild to severe symptoms.  It is possible that individuals will not recognize when they first develop symptoms because they can be similar to a cold or flu.

	The steps to limit contact with others if you are self-isolating include:
	•    avoiding individuals with chronic conditions, compromised immune systems and senior citizens;  
	•    avoiding having visitors to your home;
	•    avoiding situations such as social gatherings, work, school, daycare, health-care facilities and seniors residences;
	•    avoiding taking public transit, taxis and ride sharing;  
	•    washing your hands often with soap and warm water frequently for at least 15 to 20 seconds; and
	•    covering your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing.

	If recent travellers develop a fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in the 14 days following their departure from province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, or from the rest of mainland China or if they have been in contact with a case who has, and they are seeking health care, it is important to call ahead.  Individuals can call to their local urgent care centre or emergency department or Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free).

	At this time, public health officials are not recommending use of masks in public places, as there is no evidence that wearing masks significantly reduces the risk of getting the virus.

	Common prevention measures for viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, influenza and others.  include regular hand washing with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  It is important to clean your hands:
	•    after coughing or sneezing;
	•    when caring for a sick person;
	•    before, during and after food preparation;
	•    before eating;
	•    after toilet use; and
	•    when hands are visibly dirty.

	Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.

	PHAC has issued travel health notices about coronavirus.  For more information, visit https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/210?_ga=2.260947853.1094428749.1578423601-32662530.1555003301.

	For links to more information, visit the Manitoba public health website at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/diseases/coronavirus.html.  

	For health questions or more information on respiratory illness, Manitobans can phone Health Links–Info Santé at 788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free).

February  7, 2020
PROVINCE REMOVES SPRING ROAD RESTRICTIONS ON SEVERAL ROADWAYS


	The Manitoba government has removed spring weight restrictions on some roads and reduced others following a comprehensive review, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“Last fall, we completed a review of weight-restricted roads on the provincial highway network to better focus on local industry and economic needs,” said Schuler.  “Removing or reducing weight restrictions from several sections of road will reduce the administrative burden on transportation carriers applying for permits and remove regulatory red tape.  These changes are designed to help make Manitoba highways safer and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions since fewer trips will be needed to haul products.”

	Spring weight restrictions protect Manitoba’s surfaced roads from excessive damage by reducing the axle weights of heavy commercial vehicles, as the spring thaw can significantly reduce road foundation strength.  The province determines spring road restrictions through data collection and analysis from the previous year.  Manitoba Infrastructure (MI) can impose new road restrictions based on current conditions, as well as remove or reduce existing restrictions based on road improvements.

	In consultation with industry, MI periodically revises its policies and procedures to reflect current transportation trends, industry needs and weather patterns.  This year, it considered new criteria for changes on restricted roads, including pavement condition and traffic level, which resulted in more removals and reductions than the past few years.

	The province has removed restrictions on:
	•    Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 21 from the north junction of Provincial Road (PR) 355 to First Avenue in Shoal Lake;
	•    PR 206 from the south junction of PR 210 to the north junction of PR 210 in Landmark;
	•    PR 210 from PR 207 to PTH 12;
	•    PR 247 from PR 334 to PTH 3;
	•    PR 272 from PTH 20 to Duck Bay;
	•    PR 285 from PTH 10 to Sinclair Road;
	•    PR 326 from PR 329 to the east junction River Road in Arborg; and
	•    Sperring Avenue for 2.9 km south and west of PR 202 in Birds Hill.

	The province has reduced spring restriction levels from 65 per cent to 90 per cent of normal loading weight on:
	•    PTH 34 from PTH 1 to PTH 16;
	•    PR 244 from PTH 3 to PTH 23;
	•    PR 248 from PTH 1 to PTH 26;
	•    PR 305 from 11.3 km north of PTH 2 to the Assiniboine River;
	•    PR 422 from PTH 23 to PR 205;
	•    PR 428 from PTH 23 to PTH 14; and
	•    PR 643 (St. Laurent access) from the south junction of PTH 6 to 2.6 km west.

	The province has not added any new restrictions for spring 2020.

	Based on thawing in designated climate zones, spring road restrictions are generally in place from early March until early June.  Motor carriers, farmers, businesses and other interested parties can learn more about spring road restrictions at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/srr/index.html.

PROVINCE BUILDS ON COMMITMENT TO INCREASE HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE RECYCLING


	In support of the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan, the Manitoba government is working to develop an appliance stewardship program to increase recycling of household appliances, including ‘whitegoods’, Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard announced today.

	“We all know that recycling is critical to the protection of our environment and will help sustain the long-term viability of landfills across the province,” Guillemard said.  “Encouraging Manitobans to make small changes in their homes can have a lasting impact on our environment.  As identified in our Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan, whitegoods management is an important step in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.”

	This program would include whitegoods products containing refrigerants such as Freon or other ozone-depleting substances including appliances such as refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners and dehumidifiers.   This initiative will further reduce the province’s greenhouse-gas emissions, which will help Manitoba meet its emission reduction targets, the minister noted.

	“Every household in the province has whitegoods, whether it be a fridge, a freezer, a dehumidifier, a water cooler or an air-conditioning unit, and the improper disposal of these items leads to the release of more unwanted greenhouse gases and a negative impact on the environment,” said Dany Robidoux, executive director, Eco-West Canada.  “We are proud to be working with the province to put in place a Whitegoods Stewardship and Recycling Program that will help grow the zero-waste economy, reduce the amount of stockpiled whitegoods at landfills, create jobs for the benefit of all Manitobans.”

	Manitoba plans to modernize the regulatory framework for waste diversion and recycling to manage end-of-life whitegoods, by the end of 2021, Guillemard noted.

	The province will build on the existing network of provincial recycling programs and working with industry, municipalities and other stewardship organizations, propose to develop a plan to introduce industry-funded stewardship programs for all corded appliances by 2022, the minister added.

Background Information


	The Manitoba government has selected five leading-edge businesses to receive more than $350,000 through the new Innovation Growth Program, an investment which will help them develop and commercialize new, innovative products and services, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“This investment will help small and medium-sized Manitoba businesses develop their products, expand their workforce and help grow Manitoba’s economy over the long term,” said Eichler.  “The Innovation Growth Program provides support to businesses that are pursuing innovation and new opportunities, building on Manitoba’s many economic strengths.  Together, we are making a stronger and more prosperous province for us all now and into the future.”
	 
	The first recipients of funding through the Innovation Growth Program are:
	•    Evolution Wheel;
	•    Aquatic Life;
	•    TRAINFO Corporation;
	•    Creative Applications for Sustainable Technologies Inc.; and
	•    SolarSkyrise.

	“With assistance from the Manitoba government through the Innovation Growth Program, Evolution Wheel is able to shift our innovation and project developments into high gear,” said Derek Hird, CEO of Evolution Wheel.  “Innovation is the key to success for Manitoba-based manufacturing companies to be competitive on an international scale.  Through programs like this, we are able to shorten our development timelines so we can get to market faster and scale our internal hiring.”

	Eichler noted these businesses are the first to receive grants under the Innovation Growth Program. The five companies receiving grants are forecasting a total addition of 272 new full-time jobs and 45 part-time jobs over the next five years.  The Innovation Growth Program is cost-shared with recipients, while the Province of Manitoba provides up to 50 per cent of total project costs.

	These projects will also lend support to the Manitoba Works Plan to create 40,000 new jobs across the province over the next four years, while also supporting the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan by assisting companies that are developing technologies in clean tech areas.

	The Innovation Growth Program was launched in June 2019 as a key element of Manitoba’s Economic Growth Action Plan.

	Applications for the next program intake will be accepted until March 16.

PROVINCE UNDERTAKING FORAGE INSURANCE REVIEW
					  Manitoba Seeks Improved Participation in Forage Insurance Program:  Pedersen


	Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development is launching a review to better understand the purchasing decisions of Manitoba producers when it comes to forage insurance products available through Manitoba Agricultural Services Corporation (MASC), Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“Manitoba forage producers have had back-to-back challenging production years,” said Pedersen.  “We also know that a relatively small proportion of forage acres are insured, compared to annual crops.  To bridge that gap, we need to better understand their risks, challenges and how the current program does or does not meet their needs.”

	MASC offers various insurance and lending products to agricultural producers in Manitoba including forage insurance.  More than 1,200 producers currently have forage insurance, representing more than 272,000 acres.  This represents about 18 per cent of the more than 1.5 million eligible acres in Manitoba.  For comparison, about 90 per cent of annual crop acreage is insured through MASC.

	Mike Lesiuk, a former provincial director of agricultural policy, will lead the review.  It will ask forage producers for their perceptions about insurance products, how they currently manage risks and how the program can evolve to support growth in Manitoba’s livestock sector.

	The review will also include an environmental scan of other programs available in Canada and related research.  Recommendations will be provided to MASC and the minister later this spring.

	The forage insurance review will engage producers, producer groups and other stakeholders.

PROVINCE RELEASES BASINS CONDITION REPORT


	The Manitoba government is releasing a Basins Condition Report to provide a snapshot of soil moisture and river levels across the province at this time, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“The report will present Red River and Assiniboine River basin conditions as of late January,” said Schuler.  “The actual extent of spring run-off is still largely dependent on weather conditions between now and April.”

	As noted in the Fall Conditions Report, soil moisture levels range from well-above average in southeast Manitoba including the Red River Valley, southwest and southeast Manitoba to near normal in northern Manitoba.  In the United States portion of the Red River watershed, soil moisture levels were at record high levels.

	Since November 2019, precipitation is tracking below to well-below normal in most parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  However, precipitation in the United States portions of the Red and Souris rivers are tracking as much as 150 to 300 per cent of normal accumulation.  

	Frost depth is below normal in most areas.  As moist and frozen soils reduce infiltration of meltwater and increase spring run-off, below-normal frost depth is considered a favourable condition in reducing the extent of spring run-off.

	Base flows and levels in Manitoba rivers have been declining since the fall of 2019, but are still above normal for southern and northern Manitoba, and normal to above normal in central Manitoba basins.

	Manitoba’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is starting to build its first full Flood Outlook, which will be released in late February.  Forecasters will compile data from several sources including points south and west of Manitoba.  Weather developments from now through April will largely determine the occurrence, extent and severity of spring run-off in 2020.

	Spring run-off in Manitoba rivers is dependent on soil moisture, snow cover, soil frost depth, base flow and levels of rivers, along with the snow melt rate and the amount and timing of the spring rain.  Peak flows on Manitoba rivers are also dependent on the timing of peak flows from the United States and Saskatchewan portions of the basins.

	The Basins Condition Report is available at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/floodinfo/index.html.

RETAIL COMPLIANCE EFFORTS RESULT IN CHARGES AND SEIZURES OF ILLEGAL TOBACCO AND CANNABIS


	Manitoba Finance’s Taxation Special Investigations Unit and members of the Winnipeg Police Service recently seized 28,728 contraband cigarettes and a quantity of illegal cannabis in small individual packets from three Winnipeg retail locations, all owned and operated by the same people.
	 
	Four individuals were found selling, or in possession of, illegal tobacco products that were not marked for Manitoba tax purposes.  These individuals now face charges under The Manitoba Tobacco Tax Act and The Tax Administration and Miscellaneous Taxes Act.  The businesses face a suspension and possible revocation of their tobacco retail dealers licences.  Separate charges for possessing the illegal cannabis are pending by the Winnipeg Police Service.

	Manitoba stood to lose more than $8,600 in tax revenue if the contraband products had been sold.  For a first-time offence, individuals face fines between $1,000 and $10,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment.  If convicted, they are subject to a triple tax penalty.  Due to a previous conviction under the aforementioned acts, one of the individuals may face a quadruple tax penalty of $33,949.

	The province urges anyone who has information on contraband tobacco to contact their local police department, call the Manitoba Finance Special Investigations Unit at 204-945-1137, email smuggling_manitoba@rcmp-grc.gc.ca or call Manitoba Crime Stoppers (toll-free) at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).
