STATEMENT FROM JUSTICE MINISTER CLIFF CULLEN ON RCMP DAY IN MANITOBA


	It is an honour to recognize February 1 as RCMP Day in Manitoba, an opportunity to celebrate and reflect upon the dedication, compassion and expertise of those who serve our province.  

	Tomorrow marks the fourth annual RCMP Day in Manitoba.

	The RCMP is Manitoba’s provincial police force, with about 1,000 sworn officers and 500 civilian employees.  They tirelessly serve people living in hundreds of communities in every corner of our province, answering urgent calls for assistance when someone is in danger and attending community events in their recognizable red serge – sometimes on the same day.

	The RCMP is part of the fabric of our communities.  Perhaps that is why we all felt so moved when the RCMP lost one of its own in December.

	RCMP Day in Manitoba is an opportunity to commemorate and celebrate all of the members past and present who have selflessly served our province.  Our government is proud to support the RCMP today, and every day, as they help to keep Manitobans safe.

NOVEL CORONAVIRUS BULLETIN #1


	The World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus a global emergency.  However, Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living public health officials reminds Manitobans the risk of getting the novel coronavirus in Manitoba remains low.  Manitoba officials continue to work closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor the situation as it evolves.

	As of Jan. 30, three tests have been completed for the novel coronavirus in Manitoba.  At this time, there are no laboratory-confirmed cases in Manitoba.

	All patients seeking care at health-care facilities for fever or respiratory symptoms and have travelled in the past 14 days to the province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, in China, or who have had close contact with an ill person who travelled to that region, are being assessed for the novel coronavirus. 

	Those who meet the criteria will be placed in a designated separate waiting room.  Appropriate infection prevention and control measures will be put in place while the patient receives care including the use of surgical masks in hospital.  If a case is confirmed by laboratory testing, public health will promptly followup with close contacts to take appropriate precautions and monitor for symptoms.

	At this time, public health officials are not recommending use of masks in public places, as there is no evidence that wearing masks significantly reduces the risk of getting the virus.

	Suspected and confirmed cases of novel coronavirus are required to be reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.  To date, three cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in Canada.

	Individuals with recent travel to the province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, in China or contact with a recent traveller who currently have symptoms such as a cough, fever, sore throat, runny nose, headache, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, should contact their health-care provider or Health Links-Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free).

	Common prevention measures for viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, influenza and others include regular hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  It is important to wash your hands:
	•    after coughing or sneezing;
	•    when caring for a sick person;
	•    before, during and after food preparation;
	•    before eating;
	•    after toilet use; and
	•    when hands are visibly dirty.

	Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.

	PHAC has issued travel health notices about coronavirus. For more information, visit https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/210?_ga=2.260947853.1094428749.1578423601-32662530.1555003301.

INTERIM PHOSPHOROUS REDUCTION AND NUTRIENT REMOVAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN RELEASED


	Today, the Province of Manitoba and City of Winnipeg released the Interim Phosphorous Reduction and Nutrient Removal Implementation Plan.  The Project Technical Committee has reached consensus on the scope of work for 2020, which also includes testing for interim phosphorous removal to determine how much additional phosphorous can be removed from the city’s wastewater.

	The report was a collaborative work between the Province of Manitoba and City of Winnipeg, along with advisory input from stakeholder groups Lake Winnipeg Foundation, International Institute of Sustainable Development, Lake Winnipeg Indigenous Collective and South Basin Mayors and Reeves, and is based on work undertaken by the City of Winnipeg as reported in the December 31, 2019, progress report submitted to the province.

	The report includes an overview of all three phases of the City of Winnipeg’s plan for the North End Winnipeg Pollution Control Centre (NEWPCC) project including cost estimates and preliminary timeframe for completion of the NEWPCC upgrade. Both the Province of Manitoba and the City of Winnipeg are committed to expediting the schedule whenever possible and will continue to identify opportunities to implement nutrient removal as soon as possible. The City of Winnipeg’s existing nutrient removal plan has been in progress since the NEWPCC Master Plan was approved in 2014. Phase 1 – Power Supply and Headworks Facility – will see the power supply upgrade completed in 2020 and a request for proposals on a design-build contract for the Headworks Facility will be issued in 2020. Phase 2 – Biosolids Facility – will see design work initiated in 2020 following City Council’s approval of the 2020-23 sewer rates.

	The Project Advisory Committee (PAC) will continue to receive monthly reports on the progress, allowing for accountability, urgency and transparency in finding timeline efficiencies and identifying barriers early. The province and city appreciate the expertise, advice and valuable contributions from the committee. An update on timelines is due July 31. The PAC will continue to look for opportunities to accelerate the plan without compromising the safety and function of Winnipeg’s North End Sewage Treatment Plant.

	“The province is pleased to move forward on this vital project to ensure the health and sustainability of Lake Winnipeg and our waterways,” Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard said. “We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively and efficiently with the Project Advisory Committee and the City of Winnipeg in expediting upgrades to the North End Sewage Treatment Plant for the benefit of all Manitobans.”

	“I’m pleased to see the work of the Project Advisory Committee has confirmed the existing City of Winnipeg interim plan to reduce phosphorous from the North End Sewage Treatment Plant,” said Mayor Brian Bowman. “I look forward to continuing our work with the support of the Province of Manitoba to move as quickly as science will allow.”

	Earlier this month, the City of Winnipeg awarded the contract for interim phosphorous removal testing to AECOM following the conclusion of a competitive RFP process. Testing of interim phosphorous removal options will occur through the remainder of 2020, with a final report expected from AECOM by December 31. A recommendation report on interim phosphorous removal is expected to be presented to Manitoba Conservation and Climate and to City Council for review and approval as soon as possible with the intention of expediting timelines safely throughout the year.

	The PAC and Project Steering Committee will continue to meeting regularly, with progress reports being submitted to Manitoba Conservation and Climate monthly. These reports will also be made available to the public.

MANITOBA TO END USE OF BIRTH ALERTS
					  Focus will be on Building Trust, Safety Plans with High-Risk Mothers:  Stefanson


Backgrounder
Background Information


	As of April 1, child welfare and public health systems in Manitoba will be ready to more effectively and proactively connect mothers with supports, and will no longer issue birth alerts for high-risk expectant mothers, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“To build a relationship with an at-risk mother and connect her with the programs and supports she needs, first we need to build trust,” said Stefanson.  “Birth alerts are having the opposite effect, discouraging moms and families from reaching out at a time when we most want to work with them.  This decades-old practice will end in Manitoba, as part of our commitment to transform the child welfare system and connect families with community-based supports and services.”

	Birth alerts notify hospitals and other Child and Family Services (CFS) agencies of the need for further assessment before a newborn is discharged to the care of a parent who has been assessed as ‘high risk’.  The CFS Standards Manual provides direction on the practice of birth alerts.  Birth alerts are issued by a CFS agency and distributed by the department.  

	Provincial child welfare standards will be updated to remove references to birth alerts and clearly state expectations for a stronger focus on building voluntary partnerships with parents to address their strengths and needs, which may include the creation of a safety plan, followed by referrals  to existing community, cultural and health-care services as needed.

	The province has already been working with child welfare authorities, the health-care sector and other partners to lay the groundwork for moving away from birth alerts by April 1.  This will help ensure systems are better integrated to provide comprehensive, wrap-around supports for mothers, children and families.

	“Our priority is to help keep families together and reduce the number of children in care,” said Stefanson.  “We are shifting our focus toward better supports for expectant mothers including early interventions, reunification and better planning.”

	The minister noted the end of birth alerts will not affect the child welfare system’s ability to protect children who are at risk of neglect or abuse. All Manitobans, including health-care providers, continue to have a legislated duty to report if they think a child is at risk.

	Manitoba’s decision to end birth alerts builds on the recommendations of the Child Welfare Legislative Review Committee.  Indigenous leadership, including the Southern Chiefs Organization, Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, have also called for an end to this practice.

	The Manitoba government continues to develop programs to help connect families with the supports they need.  This includes Wednesday’s launch of Granny’s House, which will provide temporary, culturally-safe respite care, as well as the Indigenous doula social impact bond led by the Southern First Nations Network of Care.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT INCREASES EDUCATION FUNDING
					  Province Improves Transparency, Releasing School Division Out-of-Province Travel Expenses


	The Manitoba government will increase funding for public schools by more than $6.6 million for the 2020-21 school year to a record total of $1.33 billion, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	Manitoba has the third-highest spending per student in Canada at $14,733, after Saskatchewan and New Brunswick.

	“This investment in our public schools demonstrates our government’s commitment to students’ success,” said Goertzen.  “This funding is the most ever committed to public schools in Manitoba’s history.  Since 2016, funding to elementary and secondary education has grown by nearly $33 million.”

	The funding comes in addition to the province’s guarantee to build 20 new schools during the next decade.  Two new schools in Winkler and Niverville have been completed and are in use by students.  Three new elementary schools in Brandon and Winnipeg are under construction and will open later this year.  An additional two new schools in Waverley West are being designed and are scheduled to begin construction before the end of this year, the minister said.  In addition, school expansions are happening across the province with openings this week in Neepawa and La Salle.

	The cost of these 20 new schools is approximately $500 million, Goertzen said.

	The province will also continue to ensure all school divisions receive no less than 98 per cent of the operating funding they received a year earlier.

	“Like all levels of government, school divisions need to make choices and carefully prioritize spending decisions,” said Goertzen. 

	School division administration expenses topped $65 million in 2018-19.  To increase transparency, the Department of Education has released an out-of-province travel summary for school divisions.  This disclosure of travel expenses is similar to what is in use for Manitoba members of the legislative assembly and cabinet ministers. A list of school divisions' out-of-province travel expenses can be found at www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/finance/sd-opt/index.html.

	The minister noted that school divisions currently have an accumulated operating surplus in excess of $98,000,000.

	School divisions, as well, raise revenue through local education property taxes.  The minister is again requesting that school divisions limit increases to education property taxes to a maximum of two per cent for the 2020-21 school year.

	The government looks forward to receiving the final report of the Commission on Kindergarten to Grade 12 Education, which has an expected public release at the end of March.  The commission is leading a comprehensive and independent review of Manitoba’s entire public elementary and secondary education system.

MANITOBANS HAVE THEIR SAY ON NEW DISABILITY INCOME PROGRAM


	More than 500 Manitobans have participated in online and in-person consultations to share their views on the possible design of a new income support program for people with disabilities, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“Our government is committed to creating a new income support program for people with severe and prolonged disabilities, so they can lead lives of dignity,” said Stefanson.  “This is a significant undertaking for the province and consultations are helping to determine our shared priorities.  Some common themes have emerged and this will help us determine next steps in partnership with Manitobans with disabilities, their families and the community.”

	The consultations included people with disabilities, advocates, support providers and other interested Manitobans.  A preliminary review of the feedback shows strong support for a new income support program for people with severe and prolonged disabilities, which is separate from Employment and Income Assistance, as well as support for:
	•    ongoing conversations about the meaning of dignified income for people with disabilities;
	•    consistent, fair and clear processes to determine program eligibility;
	•    the ability for recipients to work and volunteer whenever possible while still retaining benefits;
	•    improved co-ordination and navigation between support programs offered by the government and other agencies;
	•    increased knowledge among program staff about the needs of people with disabilities;
	•    accessible service delivery;
	•    health supports that meet individual needs;
	•    social inclusion and a greater awareness of the unique challenges faced by people with disabilities to participate in community activities; and
	•    improved supports for transportation.

	The minister noted the feedback will be reviewed in greater detail to help develop a preliminary program design and the next stage of consultations.

	The creation of the new income support program for Manitobans with severe and prolonged disabilities remains a priority for the province, the minister said, noting it is part of the department’s 12-month strategic action plan.  Shared Priorities, Sustainable Progress was released earlier this month and is available online at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/pubs/shared-priorities-sustainable-progress.pdf.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES ADDITIONAL CONTROLS FOR MORE EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIVE PUBLIC-SECTOR MANAGEMENT
					  Provincial Commitment Will Bolster Front Lines and Protect Services:  Fielding


	The Manitoba government is taking fresh steps to bolster the front lines and protect public-sector services through additional controls on executive management compensation levels, renewed focus on flattening top-heavy management structures and reviewing management spans and layers, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“On behalf of all Manitobans, we have an ongoing responsibility to fix the province’s finances and protect public services,” said Fielding.  “Part of our government’s all-hands-on-deck approach will continue to include focus on executive compensation and overall management levels.  We expect public-sector entities to follow our example and be aligned with established priorities.  This means setting the tone from the top to protect and deliver better services, and provide more responsive front-line support.”

	These efforts will continue to be led and applied across summary government operations.  The government’s latest steps are:
	•    providing direction to Crown corporations, post-secondary institutions and school divisions to clearly set and control executive compensation limits,
	•    conducting a review of spans of control and layers of supervision to optimize manager-to-employer ratios, and
	•    reducing overall management levels by 15 per cent. 

	In addition to producing operational improvements, the resulting savings would be redirected to bolster and sustain front-line services, noted the minister.

	These steps build upon earlier government initiatives, such as reducing the size of cabinet, leading by example on internal compensation levels, reducing the number of managers in core government by 15 per cent, reviewing the spans and layers in the civil service, guiding collective bargaining by sustainability considerations throughout the public sector and introducing the recent The Public Sector Executive Compensation Act.

	Specific directives to Crowns, post-secondary institutions and school divisions on executive compensation levels mirror those previously adopted by the provincial government including a 1.75 per cent cap over four years.  The directive includes:
	•    no increases for the first 24-month period and where current terms and conditions of employment provide for one or more salary increases, this directive shall take effect one year after the last increase takes effect; 
	•    no more than 0.75 per cent increase for the next 12-month period; and
	•    no more than one per cent increase for the final 12-month period.

	“We’re committed to ensuring that appropriate management structures and practices are in place to deliver the best services and value for money.  This includes ensuring that front-line voices can be most effectively heard,” said Fielding.  “Taxpayers’ dollars should be prioritized on front-line services – next to the student, the ratepayer and the customer – for better outcomes.”

	The province has also initiated a tender process to engage consulting services to review and assess executive compensation, classification approaches and optimum spans and layers of management.  The help of outside experts will ensure this centrally co-ordinated review reflects best practices and is fairly applied across the broader public service, said Fielding.

MANITOBA EDUCATION TAKING STEPS TO IMPROVE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE


	The Manitoba government is striving to improve student attendance at school by examining best practices in other provinces, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	“School attendance is a critical factor in student achievement,” said Goertzen. “Students who attend school regularly are more engaged in learning, have a greater sense of belonging to the community and are more likely to obtain a high school diploma. Manitoba Education is working in partnership with parents, schools and communities to support and improve regular daily attendance for all students.”

	The Manitoba government has issued a request for proposals (RFP) to look at best practices in other jurisdictions for improving and maintaining student attendance. The RFP will close on Feb. 3, 2020. The RFP comes after Manitoba Education established an attendance task force, which includes community members and school division representatives and is co-chaired by the deputy ministers of Education and Justice.

	The minister noted regular daily attendance at school is critical not only for education, but for the protection of children and youth, especially the most vulnerable, in improving their outcomes. Conversely, school absenteeism is connected with poor outcomes such as justice involvement or mental illness and addictions. These efforts will help address concerns raised by the Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth, who recommended that the province examine attendance, suspension and expulsion policies to ensure that vulnerable children get the supports they need.

	Manitoba Education has a leadership role across government departments and with community agencies to promote student attendance.

	“Our government is proud to invest in upgrading existing schools in our communities,” said Goertzen.  “The newly enlarged and renovated facility will provide quality, sustainably designed and inspirational classrooms and other facilities for students in Neepawa and its surrounding area for many years to come.”

	The construction of the middle-years wing for students in grades 5 to 8, as well as a new gymnasium and the 74-seat stand-alone child-care centre on the grounds of Neepawa Area Collegiate, represent a provincial investment of approximately $16.4 million.  The new addition also includes a multi-purpose room, library and resource areas.

	The eight new, state-of-the-art classrooms have communications connectivity needed today and for the future, and accommodate up to 200 students to allow them to move out of modular classroom facilities.  The new facilities and learning spaces support the educational mission of the Province of Manitoba and the Beautiful Plains School Division.

	“A large, multi-disciplinary group of people came together to deliver this facility that will be a wonderful addition to the community of Neepawa for generations,” said Goertzen.  “I am excited that the students and families of Neepawa will have a better place to learn and play.”

GOVERNMENT INVESTS IN GRANNY'S HOUSE TO HELP KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER


	The Manitoba government is investing $400,000 to launch Granny’s House, a one-year pilot project to provide short-term, culturally safe and community-led care to children and families who could otherwise be at risk of becoming involved in the child welfare system, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“Our government is committed to keeping families together,” said Stefanson.  “Granny’s House will provide temporary respite care for children, so their parents can deal with whatever challenges and stresses they’re facing in their daily lives.  By providing trusted temporary support, Granny’s House will help reduce the number of children who become involved with the child welfare system.”

	Granny’s House will be operated by Gwekaanimad, a partnership of five community organizations in the north end of Winnipeg.  Blue Thunderbird Family Care Inc. will operate Granny’s House, which will provide 24/7 access to temporary, out-of-home respite care.  Staff for the home will be hired from the community and will include a full-time granny (housemother) and several aunties (support workers) to help the housemother in providing care for the children, as well as a case manager who will work with community partners and help connect families to other needed resources.  

	“We are thrilled to offer this program for children and families,” said Josie Hill, executive director, Blue Thunderbird.  “It recognizes the practical need for parents to have a break to do normal everyday activities while their children are cared for in the community, by the community.”

	Wahbung Abinoonjiiag Inc., Andrews Street Family Centre and Mount Carmel Clinic will refer families to Granny’s House as part of the overall service plan for the family.  The Winnipeg Boldness Project will support co-ordination and evaluation of the pilot project.  Partners estimate that Granny’s House will respond to referrals of more than 100 families every month.

	“Gwekaanimad, the collective made up of the five organizations supporting this initiative, is grateful to the province for the opportunity to provide a culturally safe space for children in our community to thrive,” said Dana Riccio-Arabe, executive director, Wahbung Abinoonjiiag.  “We acknowledge the dedication and hard work of our grannies and our aunties, and together we are determined to reclaim the village that it takes to support happy, healthy children while walking with families to build a stronger and healthier community, uninvolved in the child welfare system.”

	The minister noted the launch of Granny’s House supports a number of government priorities, including transforming the child welfare system by focusing on prevention at the community level and community-led solutions, with the goal of reducing the number of children in care.

	“Our government is proud to support community leaders who have developed an innovative solution to a challenge faced by many families,” said Indigenous and Northern Relations Minister Eileen Clarke.  “Granny’s House builds on the traditional concept of community care.  Parents can feel secure knowing their children are in a culturally safe and supportive environment.”

	Granny’s House expects to start receiving referrals for care this week.

	Granny’s House is also supported by the Grandmothers Council, an advisory group responsible for providing advice to the minister on Indigenous issues.  

	“This is our time to take back the true spirit of Indigenous ways of taking care of and healing our children,” said Mae Louise Campbell, elder and member of the Grandmothers Council.  

	Funding for Granny’s House is part of the government’s broader commitment to address mental health and addictions issues.  Other recently announced initiatives valued at more than $25 million include a request for proposals to add 100 supportive recovery-housing beds, recruiting new community helpers, investing in a collaboration between StreetReach Winnipeg and the Manitoba Adolescent Treatment Centre, and expanding the distribution of Thrival Kits.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT RELEASES INDEPENDENT RISK ANALYSIS REPORT ON LEAD IN SOIL
					  Report Reinforces Health Risk for Manitobans is Low

Watch news conference





	An independent review on lead in soil in Winnipeg neighborhoods reconfirms that there is a low heath risk for Manitobans when it comes to lead in soil.  Manitoba Health Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) and Manitoba Conservation and Climate (MCC) commissioned a third-party review to determine if there are any potential risks to human health, and how best to identify and manage areas with elevated lead concentrations in soil.

	The report was presented to government in December 2019, and the province has moved quickly to review its findings and prioritize the recommendations.

	As recommended, the province will work towards making blood lead levels in excess of established guidelines reportable under The Public Health Act.  This move will assist the province to track and better understand where lead exposure may continue to pose a problem.  This new information will help focus future public health and environmental efforts where they are needed and will have the greatest impact.

	MHSAL and MCC will also move forward with the recommendation to develop a communications and outreach plan that delivers a single, clear and effective message to the public and key stakeholders about how to mitigate potential risks.  This could include a public webpage or social media platform with regular updates for information sharing, and training for parents and caregivers of young children, as well as child care centres, community centres and preschools.

	MHSAL and MCC will continue to work with Manitoba Education and school divisions to develop a plan to address recommendations for Weston School.

	Given the primary source of lead emissions in Winnipeg are no longer present, the health risk of lead for Manitobans is low.  The report stressed that soil remediation was not recommended as a course of action.
	 
	To view the independent report’s findings and recommendations, visit: https://manitoba.ca/openmb/infomb/departments.html.

	The public is reminded to take precautions to prevent contact with lead impacted soil.  These actions can include avoiding ingestion of soil including preventing children from eating soil and washing hands after working with soil.  If homes have a lead service line or lead solder or fixtures containing lead in the plumbing system, take steps to reduce exposure.  Talk to local water suppliers for more information.

	In communities that have a corrosion control program, such as the City of Winnipeg, run the tap until the water is cold before drinking the water or using it to prepare food or infant formula.  In other communities, additional steps, such as a point-of-use filter to reduce lead to acceptable levels may be needed.

	Individuals who have concerns about their exposure to lead are encouraged to speak to their health-care provider.  Additional information is available in the lead in water fact sheet at www.gov.mb.ca/sd/pubs/water/drinking_water/rld_homechildcare.pdf.


	More information can be found in the provincial lead fact sheet at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/lead.html, and the gardening and soil contaminants fact sheet at www.manitoba.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/home_gardens.html.

MANITOBA LAUNCHES NEW IDEA FUND FOR HEALTH TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN CARE CLOSER TO HOME
					  $40 Million Available Over Four Years to Support Innovation and Quality Improvement Projects Across Manitoba's Health System: Friesen


Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government will invest up to $40 million to support innovative ideas brought forward by health-care workers that support improved delivery of services and better patient care, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Nearly 300 clinical and health system leaders from across Manitoba have identified key areas where investment is needed to build up the services available to patients closer to home,” said Friesen.  “Over the next four years, the new Idea Fund for Health will support the implementation of Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan with investments in the innovative ideas proposed by health system leaders, clinical providers and front-line staff.”

	The Idea Fund for Health will invest up to $40 million in three phases over the next four years.  The first phase, which launched today, will support projects that align with one or more of the key priorities of Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan including:
	•    reducing variation in clinical practice;
	•    building local capacity to manage chronic conditions and post-acute needs of patients, such as access to rehabilitation and remote monitoring programs; and
	•    focusing on preventive measures to improve health outcomes and reduce the need for acute services.

	Capital improvements, staff training, new or replacement equipment, and clinical practice changes are all eligible for consideration in the first wave, which will be managed by Shared Health.

	“As we construct a more reliable provincial health system, investments in tools, equipment and providers will be necessary to build capacity for care closer to home across the province,” said Lanette Siragusa, provincial lead, health system integration and quality, Shared Health.  “Upgrading skills and knowledge, standardizing clinical practices and improving access to care at home and in the community, will improve outcomes across the health system.”

	Projects will be evaluated based on expected outcomes, with successful initiatives to be launched over the coming months, the minister noted.

	“This fund is an investment in the exceptional care provided by staff across our health system each and every day,” said Friesen.  “I have every confidence the quality improvement and innovation proposals made by health system leaders, clinical experts and front-line staff will have significant positive impacts on health access and outcomes for Manitobans.”

	The new Idea Fund for Health builds on the 2018 launch of the government-wide Idea Fund, which supports a whole-of-government approach to modernizing the civil service and finding better ways to do things including shopping smarter and spending taxpayer dollars more effectively and efficiently.

	LA SALLE—Students and families in La Salle and the surrounding communities are now benefiting from an $11-million addition and renovation at La Salle School that includes a new stand-alone child-care centre, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced here today.

	“This investment will help the Seine River School Division accommodate growing enrolment in La Salle and surrounding communities,” said Goertzen.  “The health and safety of students and educators is a priority for the Manitoba government, and this modern, well-designed facility will improve outcomes for students in the region.”

	The minister noted the project included a 15,800-sq.-ft. addition to the school including six regular classrooms and a new 5,300-sq.-ft. gymnasium.  

	The former gym has been renovated to become a library and kindergarten room, while the former undersized library has been renovated to turn it into a life-skills suite.  A new 40-seat, 3,600-sq.-ft. child-care centre is located at the school site, adjacent to the school building.

	“We are very appreciative of the support of the province in assisting us in enhancing the learning environment of the school,” said Michael Borgfjord, superintendent of the Seine River School Division.  “Students and staff will benefit for many years to come, and the new space is conducive to critical thinking and innovative thinking.”

	Enrolment at La Salle School has been on the rise due to new housing and subdivision developments.  The kindergarten to Grade 8 English school had a September 2019 enrolment of 349 students, exceeding its former capacity of 325.  

	The minister noted the addition has increased the school’s capacity to 450 students.

PROVINCE CONTINUES TO PREPARE FOR NOVEL CORONAVIRUS
					  Risk of Virus Remains Low in Manitoba, But Officials Taking All Precautions:  Friesen

Watch news conference





	Manitoba continues to prepare for the potential arrival of novel coronavirus, ensuring health-care providers are aware of symptoms and implementing heightened precautions to detect, isolate and test for the virus, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen said today.

	“There have been no reported cases of novel coronavirus to date in Manitoba and the risk remains low at this time, but we must remain vigilant,” said Friesen.  “Across the health system, 911 call operators, first responders and front-line health-care staff have the information they need to identify symptoms and ensure all precautionary infectious disease protocols are in place.”

	All patients seeking care at health-care facilities for fever or respiratory symptoms who have travelled in the past 14 days to Wuhan, China – where the outbreak first occurred – or who have had close contact with an ill person who travelled to that region, will be assessed for coronavirus.  Paramedics and 911 operators have been directed to ask about a patient’s travel history if they are identifying respiratory, fever, cough or flu-like symptoms.  First responders and health-care workers are following existing infectious disease protocols to detect and prevent the spread of the virus.

	Suspected and confirmed cases of novel coronavirus are required to be reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.  

	Those who meet the criteria will be placed in a designated separate waiting room.  Appropriate infection prevention and control measures will be put in place while the client receives care including the use of surgical masks.  If a case is confirmed by laboratory testing, public health will promptly followup with close contacts to take appropriate precautions and monitor for symptoms.

	To date, two Canadian cases of the virus have been confirmed, a couple from Toronto that recently returned from Wuhan.  Out of an abundance of caution, two Manitoba patients with uncertain travel histories have been tested for novel coronavirus in recent days.  Both tested negative for the virus and positive for the common cold, said Friesen.

	“The risk remains low and we remain hopeful that we will not see confirmed cases of the virus in our province, but we are prepared in the event it does,” the minister said.  “We have excellent infection and prevention control procedures in place to help reduce the risk of illness.  Our proximity to the National Microbiology Laboratory, where confirmatory testing for the virus is occurring, is also a clear benefit to Manitobans in ensuring results are delivered promptly.”

	Public health officials in Manitoba are working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the World Health Organization to monitor the situation as it evolves.

	Global Affairs Canada announced Monday that Canadians should avoid all travel to the Hubei province of China, where Wuhan is located.

	Individuals with recent travel to Wuhan or contact with a recent traveller who currently have symptoms such as a cough, fever, sore throat, runny nose, headache, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties should contact their health-care provider or Health Links at 204-788-8200 or
	1-888-315-9257 (toll-free).

	Common prevention measures include regular hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  It is important to wash your hands:
	•    after coughing or sneezing;
	•    when caring for a sick person;
	•    before, during and after food preparation;
	•    before eating;
	•    after toilet use; and
	•    when hands are visibly dirty.

	Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.

	PHAC has issued travel health notices about coronavirus. For more information, visit https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories/pneumonia-china?_ga=2.260947853.1094428749.1578423601-32662530.1555003301.

	The Manitoba government is releasing the review of Legal Aid Manitoba that deals with the structure, operations and decision-making of Legal Aid Manitoba (LAM), Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“Our government is committed to modernizing Manitoba’s justice system and we recognize legal aid is integral to ensuring access to justice for all,” said Cullen.  “This review reinforced the excellent work already being done, while also identifying some important opportunities to make improvements while continuing to deliver quality service to Manitobans who need it.”

	The report’s 15 conclusions and recommendations identify opportunities to change how caseloads, staffing and finances are handled, with the goal of improving legal services to Manitobans and supporting the sustainability of the organization.  The minister has asked the Legal Aid Management Council, which provides strategic direction and oversight to LAM, to review the report’s findings and determine how to best implement improvements.

	The minister noted a priority area for the management council is to provide advice respecting the amounts paid to private lawyers for work conducted on behalf of legal aid clients.

	The report was written by Allan Fineblit, a well-respected legal expert who has most recently reviewed Manitoba’s family law system and has previously worked in numerous roles connected to legal aid throughout his career.  In December 2019, Fineblit was appointed as the chairperson of the Legal Aid Management Council, along with several other new members.

	The Manitoba government has released the 2018-2019 Annual Report on French Language Services, providing an overview of the activities undertaken by public bodies in support of Manitoba’s francophone population, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires, minister responsible for francophone affairs, announced today.

	“This report marks the use of a new format, in which all public bodies are reporting against their multi-year strategic French-language service plans,” said Squires.  “By learning from one another’s accomplishments and challenges, public bodies will be better equipped to meet the needs of francophones and ensure the success of their French-language services plans.”

	Squires noted this year’s annual report provides a baseline of existing French-language services from which to measure future progress.  Priorities include:
	•    building bilingual capacity,
	•    improving consultation and collaboration with the community,
	•    increasing awareness of the concept of active offer, and
	•    building concrete strategies to better support Manitobans who choose to live in French.

	The Francophone Affairs Secretariat received reports from 34 public bodies setting out the measures taken to enhance the vitality of Manitoba’s francophone community and support its development.  The annual report includes information about the activities of the secretariat and the Bilingual Service Centres, and a number of recommendations aimed at helping public bodies to better meet their overall objectives to improve their delivery of services in French.

	“The secretariat is very encouraged by the efforts public bodies have been making to improve their delivery of services in French,” said Teresa Collins, executive director, Francophone Affairs Secretariat.  “The annual report includes examples of positive practices which can be adopted by other public bodies to enhance their own results.”

	Statistics relating to bilingual capacity across public bodies show an increase in the number of bilingual employees, with over 1,400 staff able and willing to offer services in French.

	The development and implementation of multi-year, strategic French-language service plans is a key element of The Francophone Community Enhancement and Support Act, which was adopted in 2016.  This is the first year the Francophone Affairs Secretariat can report on the targets established by the public bodies in their plans.

MANITOBA TO PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT WOMEN, CHILDREN AFFECTED BY FAMILY VIOLENCE
					  Manitoba Selects Wahbung Abinoonjiiag Inc. to Lead Next Phase of Work:  Ministers

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government has chosen Wahbung Abinoonjiiag Inc. to lead a network of community agencies to help improve housing options for women and children who have experienced family violence, Families Minister Heather Stefanson, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox, minister responsible for the status of women, and Indigenous and Northern Relations Minister Eileen Clarke announced today.
	 
	“Women and children who are leaving an abusive or violent situation need a safe place to call home,” said Stefanson.  “We are proud to partner with Wahbung Abinoonjiiag to provide vulnerable Manitobans with long-term, secure and affordable housing.”
	 
	Manitoba Housing issued a request for expressions of interest in June 2019, seeking a community partner to help identify and designate up to 50 long-term social housing units for women and children affected by family violence.

	Wahbung Abinoonjiiag will work closely with family violence shelters, other organizations that provide longer-term protective and supportive housing, and women’s resource centres to ensure women and children affected by family violence are connected to appropriate social housing.  To date, several properties have been selected and work is underway to support the transition.  To protect the safety and privacy of families, locations will not be disclosed.
	 
	“Organizations like Wahbung Abinoonjiiag and their partners understand how important a stable, safe home can be for women and children as they start a new life,” said Cox.  “These families can feel supported, knowing their housing provider also has expertise and understanding related to their situation.  We believe this partnership will help more women and children to heal and thrive.”
	 
	”Wahbung Abinoonjiiag is honoured to be selected to lead this important initiative,” said Dana Riccio-Arabe, executive director.  “Our partnership model works in collaboration with sister organizations to provide wrap-around supports and services for children and their families affected by violence to have safe, affordable housing to call home.  We would like to thank the province for selecting our organization, our partnership model for their collective wisdom, and our community for trusting us to lead this important work.  Together, we can not only envision but actively work toward a place and time where children and their families can live free of violence and unrestrained by the impacts of violence.”

	Wahbung Abinoonjiiag expects to begin taking referrals for housing needs this spring.

	“Our government is proud to form important partnerships with community-based Indigenous organizations like Wahbung Abinoonjiiag,” said Clarke.  “These are significant steps to advancing reconciliation.”

	Stefanson noted the province’s support for Wahbung Abinoonjiiag builds on housing priorities recently set out in a 12-month department action plan.  It notes priority will be given to populations that face barriers in securing housing, including women and children experiencing domestic violence.  The action plan is available online at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/pubs/shared-priorities-sustainable-progress.pdf.

AGREEMENT ON DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS FOR PHYSICIAN BILLING REACHED
					  Legislative Amendment to Address Doctors' Concerns Will be Introduced in Spring Session:  Friesen


	The Manitoba government will bring changes to The Regional Health Authorities Act in the upcoming spring session that would strengthen the resolution process for disputes over physician billing, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	 

	“Ensuring proper billing oversight, accountability and fairness is essential in a well-functioning health system,” said Friesen.  “We are pleased to have brokered an agreement with Doctors Manitoba to address concerns they raised about disputes that could arise from billing audits.”

	 

	Under the former government, oversight for physician billing was significantly scaled back, which impacted both accountability and recovery of funds paid out either inappropriately or by error, said Friesen.  For instance, in 2015, physician billing totalled $741 million, yet only $7,000 was determined to be an overpayment.  That represents a recovery rate of less than one-thousandth of one per cent.

	 

	“Doctors across Manitoba provide excellent and compassionate care,” said Friesen.  “However, with nearly a billion dollars in taxpayer dollars now at stake, we know there must be better checks and balances in place to ensure every payment made is appropriate.” 

	 

	Modification of the bill will come in the form of an amendment to be introduced when the legislature resumes sitting in March.

	 

	Amendments to The Regional Health Authorities Act and other legislation were re-introduced in the fall to support Manitoba’s health-care transformation plan in order to simplify an overly complex and expensive system that achieves better results for patients.  In addition to articulating the role of the department in a clearer way, the bill would better align and integrate the responsibilities of Shared Health and various service delivery organizations including regional health authorities.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DAUPHIN AND PARKLAND REGION
					  Region a Prime Example of Province's Commitment to Rural Job Creation and Investment:  Eichler


	The Manitoba government will continue to lay a foundation for private-sector investment and job creation in Dauphin and the wider Parkland region with several exciting initiatives this year, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“Our government’s Manitoba Works plan has established a target for creation of 40,000 new jobs in the province over the next four years and a key part of the plan is attracting new investment to communities throughout rural Manitoba including Dauphin and Parkland,” said Eichler.  “We are taking a whole-of-government approach to economic development and job creation, and are thrilled to see the board of Manitoba’s new Rural Economic Development Agency at the table to help achieve our target.”

	Through red tape reduction, the decrease to the provincial sales tax and overall investment of more than $40 million in the region since 2018, the Manitoba government continues to foster the economic conditions that will ensure an even stronger future for Dauphin and the Parkland region, the minister added.

	The Rural Economic Development Agency will be operational in 2020, and in collaboration with Manitoba’s Economic Development Office, will provide concierge service to potential investors.  This will include assistance in government navigation, connections to local businesses and the facilitation of meetings with specific companies to look for opportunities for accelerating priority projects in the Parkland region.

	The province’s efforts in 2020 to position the region for economic growth will include:


		the Economic Development Office and the Rural Economic Development Agency will hold a regional meeting with Team Manitoba strategic partners North Forge, World Trade Centre Winnipeg and Travel Manitoba in Dauphin in February;

		the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce, in partnership with the Dauphin and District Chamber of Commerce, will host an economic development tour and mission to the area this spring to connect potential investors with opportunities;

		Travel Manitoba and Dauphin Economic Development and Tourism are discussing opportunities for a place-branding project to support the tourism industry and to position Dauphin to attract increased private-sector investment, and Travel Manitoba will also hold a regional tourism workshop and will work closely with the Dauphin region to market tourism products and opportunities;

		the province will undertake a labour market study for the Dauphin area to provide a tool to support business expansion and to attract investment, and will engage Dauphin Economic Development and Tourism in this process; and

		ongoing supports for business and industry in the region will be available through Manitoba Economic Development and Training for training opportunities, as well as for tax increment financing and tax credit programs, as these programs support business expansion and the attraction of investment to the region.


	“This year will be an exciting one for the residents of Dauphin and the Parkland region,” said Eichler.  “With our Rural Economic Development Agency ready to hit the ground running, now is the time to build upon the province’s investments and commitment to Parkland.  I am confident our efforts, in collaboration with our Team Manitoba partners, will see the region continue to prosper as we position it for economic growth and investment.”

MANITOBA TO REVITALIZE HISTORIC DAUPHIN COURTHOUSE WITH MAJOR INVESTMENT INTO RENOVATIONS, EXPANSION


	DAUPHIN—The century-old Dauphin courthouse will undergo major renovations as part of ongoing efforts to revitalize and modernize Manitoba’s courts, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced here today.

	“Our government is committed to enhancing Manitoba’s justice system and to help keep Manitobans safe in their homes and communities,” said Cullen.  “Providing accessible, efficient justice services to those living in Dauphin and surrounding communities is a priority, and these investments will support further modernization of Manitoba’s courts.”

	The courthouse will be expanded and fully renovated at an estimated cost of more than $11 million to provide improved facilities for Manitobans accessing justice services in the Parkland region including:
	•    enhanced courthouse security, including more holdings cells, to keep the public and court staff safe while improving the efficiency of court proceedings;
	•    improved interior and exterior accessibility, including accessible washrooms, and more accessible public, court and administrative spaces;
	•    improved video-conferencing and meeting spaces for lawyers and their clients; and
	•    new administrative and office spaces for court staff, sheriff services and the judiciary.

	The design of the courthouse will be finalized in the coming months, with plans to minimize disruptions during renovations, Cullen noted.

	Built in 1917, the adjacent Dauphin Correctional Centre (DCC) is the oldest correctional facility in Manitoba and no longer meets modern correctional needs, and it has reached the end of its serviceability.  Operations will begin winding down at DCC and are expected to cease by the end of May, the minister noted. 

	The goal is to provide employment for all employees if possible and the Manitoba government will be working with the Civil Service Commission and the union to find creative ways to do so while respecting the rights and obligations contained in the collective agreement, the minister said.

	“We will be respecting the collective agreement,” Cullen said. “We want to ensure a smooth transition and will be working with the union in the coming days.”

	Those in custody in Dauphin will continue to be held at the six other adult correctional facilities located throughout the province.  There is currently sufficient capacity at the other facilities following an overall decline in the provincial inmate population.
	   
	The minister noted these decisions align with the goals set out under the Criminal Justice Modernization Strategy, which was released in March 2018.  It focuses on reducing crime, improving public safety, reducing the number of people coming into conflict with the law and improving access to justice.  The strategy is available online at www.gov.mb.ca/justice.

REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS ISSUED TO IMPROVE DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES AT GRACE HOSPITAL
					  New Imaging Machines Will Ensure More Manitobans Have Easier Access to Care They Need:  Friesen


	The Manitoba government and Grace Hospital Foundation will invest in enhanced and modernized diagnostic services at Grace Hospital as part of a capital project that will improve patient flow and access to care at the hospital, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Our government is committed to ensuring patients get the right care, sooner, including efforts to ensure Manitobans have easier access to the care they need,” said Friesen.  “This capital project will allow for more timely care of patients by expanding diagnostic imaging services, ensuring the Grace Hospital is equipped to fulfil its role as one of Winnipeg’s three acute hospitals.”

	The project will include renovation of space to improve patient flow and staff efficiency as well as the addition of several new pieces of equipment that will both modernize and enhance the diagnostic services available at the site.  These improvements include:
	•    relocation of cardiac testing and some ultrasound services to create a centralized location for all diagnostic imaging services, to improve patient care and staff workflow;
	•    a new state-of-the-art gamma camera used to in nuclear medicine for the diagnosis of a range of illnesses;
	•    a second CT scanner to eliminate unplanned downtime which can require emergent patients to be transferred to other sites for CT imaging, as well as upgrades to the site’s existing CT scanner; and
	•    a new fully digital X-ray machine to speed up access to high-resolution imaging.

	In addition to the Manitoba government’s commitment to the project, the Grace Hospital Foundation will support the renovation with a capital campaign.

	“Improving the services available to patients who receive care at Grace Hospital is our driving motivation at the foundation,” said Jon Einarson, executive director, Grace Hospital Foundation.  “We are pleased to be able to support this exciting project which will see improved patient care, increased access to vital diagnostic services and a better work environment for hospital staff.”

	The project will bring together a number of services that are currently located in different areas of the hospital, with construction to be completed in phases to ensure minimal impact to patient care and continued availability of diagnostic services.

	“This investment will position the site to meet the diagnostic needs of the patients it sees as one of Winnipeg’s three acute hospitals and emergency departments,” said Petr Kresta, chief operating officer, diagnostic services, Shared Health.

	The project, which follows the opening of the Grace Hospital’s new, $43.8-million emergency department in 2018, is anticipated to be complete by the end of 2021, the minister added.

DISASTER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED FOR 2019 OCTOBER SEVERE WEATHER EVENT
					  Relief Available for Eligible Municipalities, Homeowners, Farms and Small Business:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government will make disaster financial assistance (DFA) available for eligible municipalities, homeowners, farms and small businesses impacted by severe weather in October 2019, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“When a widespread natural disaster strikes and creates an unreasonable financial burden, DFA may be made available to help individuals and local authorities recover,” said Pallister.  “The fall storm resulted in widespread damage, and the DFA program will help cover the costs of response and recovery from the overall weather event.”

	When a natural disaster occurs, the province may declare the event eligible for DFA.  The Manitoba Emergency Measures Act allows the provincial government to provide financial assistance if the event meets the criteria outlined in the act.

	Disaster financial assistance is generally available as a last resort for evacuations, municipal response costs, repairs to damaged infrastructure and non-insurable damage to principal residences and buildings essential to the operation of eligible farms and small businesses.  Home and business owners affected by the fall severe weather are encouraged to seek assistance first through private insurance claims, and to carefully check insurance coverage to ensure they are protected against potential risks in their area.

	The federal government may provide financial assistance to provincial and territorial governments through Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements following large-scale natural disasters.  The premier noted the province is confident the impacts of the fall 2019 storm will be eligible for federal funding.

	Applications and further details are available online at www.manitobaemo.ca or by calling the Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization at 204-945-3050 or (toll-free) 1-888-267-8298.  Applications are also available at most municipal offices.

	The storm also created the need to use the Red River Floodway for the first time ever in the fall.  The province previously announced a compensation program related specifically to the floodway.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES DIALYSIS SERVICES EXPANDING IN DAUPHIN
					  Enhanced Access Builds on Other Recent Investments Across the Province:  Friesen


	An additional 12 spaces will be added for dialysis patients at Dauphin Regional Health Centre, enhancing access to life-saving treatment for residents in the community and Parkland region, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Our government is committed to ensuring services that bring care closer to home,” said Friesen.  “By increasing the number of spaces for dialysis patients in Dauphin, we will ensure more people living with kidney disease or failure have better access to the care they need, when they need it.”

	Two trained renal staff have been hired to support the addition of an evening shift at the Dauphin Regional Health Centre, expanding weekly patient capacity to 36 from 24.  The additional spaces will become available on March 1.  The expansion represents an annual investment of approximately $300,000, the minister noted.

	Approximately 14 per cent of Manitobans live with kidney disease and about one-third of them may develop kidney failure in their lifetime.

	“We know the number of area residents living with end stage kidney disease is increasing,” said Penny Gilson, chief executive officer, Prairie Mountain Health.  “We are responding to this increased demand by continuing to plan prevention initiatives, deliver co-ordinated services and allocate appropriate resources to enhance access to service within the health region.”

	Hemodialysis uses a machine to remove blood from the body, clean it and then return it to the body.  Peritoneal dialysis cycles a solution into and out of the stomach through a tube to collect and get rid of waste and fluid.

	“As Manitoba’s rates of kidney failure continue to rise, expanding these services means more Manitobans will receive this vital treatment as close to home as possible,” said Dr. Mauro Verrelli, medical director of the Manitoba Renal Program.  “At the same time, we continue to work alongside partners and care providers on efforts to prevent or delay kidney failure when possible.”

	The new initiative aligns with Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan, which provides a roadmap for changes that will decrease travel and wait times for patients, bringing improved health-care capacity closer to home.

	It also builds on a $5.2-million investment to provide critical life-saving services for up to 72 patients and support staff in a number of communities including Winnipeg, Thompson, Swan River, Hodgson, Pine Falls, Portage la Prairie and at the Boundary Trails Health Centre (Morden/Winkler).  That investment will create up to 57 additional positions, including nearly 30 nurses, a majority of which have already been filled, Friesen said.  He added, in total, this investment will add an additional 9,672 hemodialysis treatments each year.

	The province has also invested $500,000 to expand the home dialysis programs in Brandon and Winnipeg.  A 22-station hemodialysis unit at Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg is also being constructed that will support up to 132 patients when at full capacity.  Construction is expected to be complete by early 2021, the minister noted.

	For many people, early detection and treatment of kidney disease can help prevent or delay kidney failure or the need for dialysis.  Learn about kidney health and the Manitoba Renal Program at www.kidneyhealth.ca/.

January 21, 2020
MANITOBA PRODUCERS TO BENEFIT FROM YIELD TRENDING


	Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development advises that ongoing technological, agronomic and genetic advances have resulted in an upward trend in yields for many crops grown in the province.  To help reflect these changes, yield trending will be introduced in Manitoba’s AgriInsurance program for the 2020 growing season.

	A positive trend has been identified in eight crops including red spring wheat, canola, soybeans, grain corn, oats, white pea beans, irrigated processing potatoes and hemp grain.  Probable yields, used to determine insurance coverage, will increase for these crops as a result of implementing yield trending.

	With regular updating, as well as the implementation of yield trending, total insurance coverage will increase to almost $3 billion in 2020 with producers paying premiums similar to 2019.

	Additional program changes for the 2020 growing season include:
	•    MASC will offer the contract price option (CPO) on canola, including specialty oil canola, and field peas.  Manitoba producers have been requesting greater coverage for higher value crops for several years.  This option will allow producers to blend the price from their contracted production with the base AgriInsurance dollar value (weighted by production) to better reflect expected market prices.
	•    Fall rye will be introduced as an eligible crop for organic insurance.
	•    Producers will now be eligible for a reseed benefit on annual novel crops based on 25 per cent of the per acre dollar coverage selected for their novel crops.  If the annual novel crop fails to establish by June 20, a reseed benefit will be available on those acres.  Producers may select from three different coverage levels:  $150, $200 or $250 per acre.
	•    Forages used for extended-season grazing are now eligible for wildlife damage compensation.  This includes crops used for in-field bale and swath grazing, as well as standing annual crops intended for grazing (e.g. corn).  Producers will receive 45 per cent of the value of the loss caused by big game and waterfowl during the extended grazing period.
	•    Strawberries are now an eligible crop under the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program.  Compensation will be available for plant loss, as well as production loss.

	Manitoba has the highest level of AgriInsurance participation in Canada with over 90 per cent of annual crop acres enrolled and more than 8,000 farms are registered in the program.  The total governments’ share of AgriInsurance premium for 2020-21 is expected to be $125.01 million.  AgriInsurance is provided for over 70 different annual crops and forages during establishment and production, as well as for the inability to seed land in the spring due to wet conditions.

	Under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, AgriInsurance premiums for most programs are shared 40 per cent by participating producers, 36 per cent by the Government of Canada and 24 per cent by the Manitoba government.  Administrative expenses are paid 60 per cent by Canada and 40 per cent by Manitoba.

	AgriInsurance is a risk management program administered by MASC.  For more information about it and other programs, visit a MASC office or www.masc.mb.ca.

MANITOBA WILL HAVE CLEANEST FUEL STANDARDS IN CANADA
					  Cap the Carbon Tax, Respect Manitoba's Record Investments in Clean Energy and Keep More Money in the Pockets of Manitobans:  Premier


	BRANDON—Manitoba will have the cleanest fuel standards in Canada by increasing the ethanol and biodiesel content of its transportation fuels as it implements its Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan, Premier Brian Pallister announced here today during his dignitary address at the annual Manitoba Ag Days exhibition.

	“We have the cleanest electricity in Canada already and soon we will have the cleanest fuels in Canada too,” said Pallister.  “Manitoba is leading the country once again.”

	These new clean fuel standards will reduce Manitoba’s emissions by almost 400,000 tonnes cumulatively over the next five years.  This is the equivalent of taking 100,000 vehicles of the road.

	“Agriculture always has been and always will be the key to Manitoba’s economic success,” said Pallister.  “As an important economic driver, our agriculture industry cannot take its foot off the gas, so we will make that gas greener.”

	Manitoba will increase the ethanol content requirement of gasoline to 10 per cent from 8.5 per cent, and the biodiesel content of diesel to five per cent from two per cent, the premier noted.  Consultations with industry, stakeholders and all Manitobans will take place in the coming months and any necessary regulation changes will be made this spring, he added.

	Following a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yesterday, the premier is calling on the federal government for a fresh evaluation of the province’s Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan to cap the carbon tax on Manitobans.

	“Manitobans deserve respect for our green agenda, our historic and significant investments in clean, green renewable energy,” said Pallister.  “Our plan puts a price on carbon that is low and level, like the Prairies, and keeps more money in the pockets of Manitobans while getting the same amount of emissions reductions as the rising federal carbon tax.  Our Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan is better for the economy, better for the environment and better for Manitoban families.”

	Today’s announcement builds on the government’s climate change and green initiatives to make Manitoba the cleanest, greenest, and most climate resilient province in Canada, through its Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan.  This includes:
	•    investing billions of dollars invested in clean, renewable hydroelectric energy;
	•    eliminating, once and for all, the use of coal for electricity generation;
	•    providing over $200 million for the GROW and Conservation Trust programs to sustain investments in cleaner air, water and soil management;
	•    creating watershed management strategies;
	•    establishing Efficiency Manitoba demand-side management;
	•    introducing fuel-efficiency measures for the trucking industry; and
	•    working with the private sector to eliminate the use of plastic bags.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES NEW LEGACY FARM AWARD


	BRANDON—A new category has been added to the Manitoba Farm Family Recognition program, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced here today.

	“Agriculture has changed greatly over the past 150 years and it’s important that we recognize those families that have been involved in the industry for generations,” said Pedersen.  “With technology advancing at such a rapid rate, it’s exciting to think of where we may be 150 years from now, but it’s important that we don’t forget our past.”

	As part of Manitoba’s 150th birthday, the Legacy Farm Award has been created to celebrate farm families that have 150 consecutive years as a Manitoba Farm Family.  The Century (100 years) and Heritage (125 years) Family Farm Awards will still be available.

	“Going back 150 years ago about 90 per cent of the population were farmers.  These farms produced enough to feed their families, with limited surplus to trade or export,” said Pedersen.  “Now about four per cent of our population are actively farming and agriculture production is a key economic driver in our province.”

	Since the first Century Farm was recognized in 1981, there have been more than 1,810 farms that have received the award.  There have been an additional 97 farms that have received the Heritage Farm award since the first was recognized in 2010.

	To be eligible for the award, the land must have been held in continuous ownership by direct descendants of the original owner, with a minimum land area of at least 20.23 hectares (50 acres) over the life of the farm.

	The Manitoba government has renewed a three-year funding agreement in support of 233-ALLÔ, a French-language information service offered by the Société de la francophonie manitobaine, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires, minister responsible for francophone affairs, announced today.

	“The renewal of this agreement ensures the continued delivery of this important service, which helps to keep Manitobans informed about the francophone community and French-language services available in our province,” said Squires.  “It also supports the objectives of The Francophone Community Enhancement and Support Act and The Bilingual Service Centres Act.”

	233-ALLÔ was created in 1989, with a mandate to offer information about the francophone community and services available in French in Manitoba.  Its services include a telephone information line, a community calendar and a directory of services in French.  233-ALLÔ also collaborates with Manitoba’s six Bilingual Service Centres, offering seamless information services between the francophone community and government bodies.

	“The Francophone Affairs Secretariat is delighted this key partnership between the province and the community is being extended for another three years,” said Teresa Collins, executive director.  “The Bilingual Service Centres are committed to their role in ensuring the ongoing support of our francophone community through this collaboration.”   

	“We are thrilled to continue collaborating with the province on the promotion of French language services in Manitoba,” said Christian Monnin, president of the Société de la francophonie manitobaine.  “233-ALLÔ is truly the gateway to Manitoba’s francophone community and we are pleased the government recognizes its significance.”

	Squires noted the funding includes an annual grant of $72,500 to support the operations of 233-ALLÔ.  The renewed agreement extends the service until March 31, 2022.  The annual grant from the province is matched by federal funds leveraged under the Canada–Manitoba Agreement on French-Language Services, for total funding of $145,000 per year.

PROVINCE SHARES 12-MONTH STRATEGY FOR TRANSFORMING, IMPROVING FAMILY SERVICES


	To help ensure its programs and services will meet the needs of Manitobans now and into the future, the Manitoba government is implementing a transformation strategy focused on improving outcomes for vulnerable Manitobans, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“We need to transform the way we provide services to Manitobans so that we are offering them a hand up, not a hand out,” said Stefanson.  “The Department of Families has set out a 12-month plan that clearly outlines how we will work together to protect our children, reduce dependence on government programs, and strengthen Manitoba families and communities.”

	A strategy document outlines the transformation agenda that affects every area within the department, and which will continue to influence its work in the years to come.  Some priority areas include:


		exploring how to better meet the needs of people who access Community Living disABILITY Services through the ongoing implementation of an updated funding model, innovative supports and service improvements made in partnership with clients and stakeholders, and options to better meet the needs of First Nations people with disabilities;

		implementing targeted and customized supports for people who have the greatest opportunity to regain financial independence through employment, reducing their reliance on Employment and Income Assistance;

		building capacity in the community and among private-sector partners to deliver social housing, while continuing to invest in modernizing provincially owned and managed properties;

		transforming the child welfare system, with the goal of reducing the number of children in care and building stronger connections with culture and community, through a results-focused single-envelope funding model and new legislation based on the recommendations of the Legislative Review Committee; and

		improving early learning and child-care options for Manitoba families, by supporting the creation of new child-care spaces and more child-care options for families, while also reviewing the current funding model to ensure sustainability.


	The strategy was first released to all department staff in December.  Since then, senior staff have met with hundreds of employees at town-hall meetings to talk about the goals of the strategy and how their work will help achieve it.  This work will continue over the coming months to help ensure staff remain engaged and informed.

	The minister noted this work supports the objectives set out under the government’s broader transformation strategy.  The department’s strategy document, Shared Priorities – Sustainable Progress: A 12-Month Action Plan for Manitoba Families, is available at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/pubs/shared-priorities-sustainable-progress.pdf and Transforming the Manitoba Public Service is available at https://mbmeasuringprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/transformation_2018-1.pdf.

	Manitoba Finance is reminding employers to ensure workers are adequately trained to perform their duties and to have adequate safeguards in place for machines, after two employers were prosecuted for violations of The Workplace Safety and Health Act and its associated regulations.
	 
	On Aug. 22, 2016, a Minitonas-based Louisiana-Pacific Canada Ltd. worker was assisting in the coupling and uncoupling of rail cars.  This was not a part of the worker’s regular duties.  When the rail cars came to a stop, the worker stood on the coupler assembly.  The coupler assembly continued to retract, pinching the worker’s feet and resulting in serious injuries.  Louisiana-Pacific Canada Ltd. pleaded guilty to failing to provide information, instruction and training to the worker before the worker was moved to another area of the workplace that had different facilities, procedures or hazards.  Louisiana-Pacific Canada Ltd. was ordered to pay $42,500 in fines and penalties and an additional $3,500 payable to the Workplace Safety and Health Public Education Fund.  By law, money placed into this fund must be used for educating the public on matters relating to occupational safety and health.

	On Feb. 9, 2017, a worker from Power and Mine Supply Company Limited was manufacturing a wooden crate and was using a mitre saw.  The guard was not installed on the saw and the worker’s hand came into contact with the rotating blade, resulting in serious injuries.  Power and Mine Supply Company Limited pleaded guilty to failing to ensure that a machine had safeguards sufficient to prevent a worker from coming into contact with points on the machine where material is cut.  Power and Mine Supply Company Limited was ordered to pay $20,000 in fines and penalties and an additional $5,000 payable to the Workplace Safety and Health Public Education Fund.

					  Renewed Funding Agreement Focuses on Outreach:  Stefanson


	The Manitoba government is investing $120,800 with the Manitoba League of Persons with Disabilities (MLPD) to provide educational and outreach work that will help ensure organizations understand and comply with the accessible employment standard, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“Accessibility is important to all Manitobans and a priority for our government,” said Stefanson.  “We are pleased to support this work with the MLPD.  This funding will help them deliver workshops, share tools and resources, and provide advice and expertise to organizations to promote the development and implementation of accessible employment practices.”

	With this provincial investment, MLPD will collaborate with organizations to identify, remove and prevent barriers related to accessibility in employment.  This work will also help businesses and organizations better understand the regulatory requirements related to Manitoba’s accessible employment standard.

	“MLPD is pleased the province recognizes the need for accessibility,” said Fred Dugdale, treasurer, MLPD.  “This funding will support our accessibility services to employers regarding the new employment standards.  It enables us to increase awareness and education regarding accessibility, which in turn impacts our members.”

	Manitoba’s accessible employment standard was passed in April 2019 and is being phased in to fully apply to all employers in the province by May 2022.  Manitobans with disabilities are more likely to be unemployed or under-employed than their counterparts who do not have disabilities.  The minister noted employers are able to benefit from a much larger pool of prospective employees by making recruitment and employment practices more accessible.

	The minister also noted the important role of MLPD, as the organization represents Manitobans with a broad range of disabilities on common issues and concerns.  The province’s funding agreement with  MLPD will be in place until March 31, 2022.

SMALL CHANGES, SMART DECISIONS YIELD SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS FOR MANITOBANS
					  Listening to Civil Servants, Fulfilling 100-Day Action Plan Commitment:  Pallister


	The Manitoba government is pleased to act on the advice of civil servants on various projects across government departments that will streamline operations, increase productivity, improve service delivery and ultimately save millions of taxpayer dollars, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“It pays to ask for advice.  As part of our 100-Day Action Plan and our commitment to listening to Manitobans, our government set up the Idea Fund to support innovative solutions brought forward by the civil service,” said Pallister.  “By making small changes and smart decisions millions of taxpayer dollars will be saved, while simultaneously improving the services we provide to Manitobans.”

	As part of the province’s 100-Day Action Plan each department within government was asked to develop and submit at least five applications to access the Idea Fund.  Examples of the projects that have been accepted and will be implemented are:


		An initial investment of $625,000 will be made to develop a new treasury management solution (TMS), with the view to automating the process.  The TMS includes the development of a corporate banking strategy that will enhance cash flow visibility and improve investment management decisions, which will reduce borrowing costs and increase investment yield.

		A new automated toner delivery system will automatically send an electronic alert to suppliers when toner is low on 2,300 government network printers.  The province could save upwards of $1.1 million over four years on a $155,000 investment and a return on investment of over 720 per cent.

		The Life’s Journey agency is building a custom home in Elie for individuals transitioning from the Manitoba Developmental Centre to community placement.  The Idea Fund will be used to cover part of the construction costs, savings taxpayers an estimated $485,943 in net savings over four years.

		Video conferencing equipment will help Manitoba Justice officials save over $9,000 to better manage staff time, creating working efficiencies by eliminating time spent on travel between meetings.

		Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living has a proposal that will result in net savings of $74,000 over four years based on a $24,000 investment by cutting paperwork for specialist physicians prescribing selected drugs in the Exception Drug Status group. 


	The launch of the Idea Fund supports a whole-of-government approach to modernize the civil service, and find better way of doing things, shopping smarter and spending taxpayer dollars more effectively and efficiently, the premier noted.

MANITOBA AGRICULTURAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S HAY DISASTER BENEFIT ACTIVATED FOR 2019


	Manitoba Agricultural Services Corporation (MASC) is notifying producers the Hay Disaster Benefit (HDB) has been activated and associated payments will begin shortly. The estimated payout for 2019 is in excess of $5 million on approximately 1,500 claims, announced Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen. 

	“We recognize it has been a difficult harvest for many farmers in Manitoba,” said Bibeau. “The Hay Disaster Benefit is one of the ways our government is supporting farmers to protect their businesses against weather-related risks, such as this forage shortfall.""

	“The Hay Disaster Benefit (HDB) is a complimentary feature of the AgriInsurance program that compensates insured forage producers for the increased cost of hay and transportation when there is a severe provincial forage shortfall,” said Pedersen. “All producers who are enrolled in the Select Hay Insurance and Basic Hay Insurance programs are automatically enrolled in the HDB.”

	The HDB was first introduced in 2014 as part of a revamped forage insurance offering. Payments were made to producers for the first time in 2018.

	All insured hay types (alfalfa, alfalfa grass mixtures, grasses, sweet clover and coarse hay) are eligible.

	To trigger an HDB payment, at least 20 per cent of producers with Select Hay or Basic Hay Insurance must harvest less than 50 per cent of their long-term average hay yield. For 2019, producers will receive an additional $40 for each tonne below their Select Hay or Basic Hay Insurance coverage.

	There is no cost to producers for this benefit. Premiums are cost shared 60 per cent by the Government of Canada and 40 per cent by the Province of Manitoba under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership.

	For more information on forage insurance in Manitoba, contact a MASC office or visit www.masc.mb.ca/masc.nsf/program_forages.html. The deadline to sign-up for 2020 forage insurance is March 31.

PROVINCE LAUNCHES NEW SOCIAL IMPACT BOND TO HELP MANITOBANS QUIT SMOKING
					  First-of-its-Kind Partnership Will Improve People's Health, Reduce Smoking's Impact on Health System:  Friesen


	The Manitoba government is launching what is believed to be the world’s first social impact bond dedicated to helping people quit smoking, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“We know that approximately 160,000 Manitobans currently smoke, causing adverse health effects for themselves and those around them,” said Friesen.  “This new social impact bond will help more Manitobans quit smoking and live healthier lives, creating savings for the health system that can be re-invested towards further improvements to care.”

	A social impact bond is an innovative social policy tool that brings together government, the private sector, not-for-profits and other stakeholders to deliver effective and prevention-focused solutions.  Private investment is used to fund the programs initially, and then is repaid if social outcomes and cost savings are realized.  These types of programs allow the government to explore more innovative solutions without financial risk, with the ultimate goal of delivering better outcomes for Manitobans.

	In this case, the Manitoba government will partner with Shoppers Drug Mart and Pharmacists Manitoba on a smoking cessation social impact bond, beginning in April.  Under this model, Shoppers Drug Mart will invest $2 million over the next five years to fund activities around smoking cessation including counselling and nicotine replacement therapies.  Research shows these forms of treatment can increase the chances of long-term smoking cessation by up to 40 per cent, which in turn reduces hospital, medication and physician costs.

	The goal of the bond is to enrol up to 4,500 smokers over a three-year period based on their readiness to quit and to ensure a minimum of 12 per cent quit smoking with the support of one of more than 500 Manitoba pharmacists trained in smoking cessation.  Increasing the number of Manitobans who successfully quit smoking could save the province more than $1 million annually in lower health-care costs, Friesen said.

	Success metrics will focus on the number of people who participate in an initial assessment with a trained pharmacist, the number of people who have quit smoking for at least 12 months and the number of people who continue to abstain from nicotine after 24 months.  If outcomes are met or exceeded, the company will receive up to $2.12 million.

	“The health risks associated with smoking are among the costliest and the most preventable.  Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacists are trained to support patients through their journey, providing counsel and different approaches based on individual needs,” said Jeff Leger, president, Shoppers Drug Mart.  “We are confident in this new collaborative program and our ability to work with patients, the Manitoba government and Pharmacists Manitoba to help make our province healthier.”

	Anyone over the age of 18 is eligible for assistance and can approach participating pharmacies for an initial assessment.  The program will initially focus on health regions where smoking rates are highest – Northern (33 per cent), Interlake-Eastern (23 per cent) and Prairie Mountain (22 per cent).

	The provincewide smoking rate is 14.5 per cent, slightly below the Canadian average of 15.1 per cent.

	“Pharmacists work tirelessly every single day to make a difference in patients’ lives and this is another opportunity to demonstrate the positive contribution our members make to improved health care for Manitoba families,” said Pawandeep Sidhu, board president, Pharmacists Manitoba.  “A social impact bond dedicated to helping people quit smoking will positively impact countless Manitobans and we look forward to partnering with the government to implement the new program.”

	A 2015 report commissioned by Manitoba Health determined direct smoking-related illnesses cost the province’s health-care system approximately $244 million per year.

	This marks Manitoba’s second social impact bond.  Last year, the Manitoba government partnered with Southern First Nations Network of Care and Wiijii’idiwag Ikwewag, an Indigenous doula service provider, on a two-year pilot project designed to connect at-risk Indigenous mothers with doulas.

					  Harnessing the Energy, Passion and Perspective of Young Manitobans:  Guillemard


	The Manitoba government is proud to follow through on its commitment to engage the next generation in the collective fight against climate change and has selected nine young Manitobans as members of the new Youth Advisory Council on climate, Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard announced today.

	“Young people want to be heard, and have valuable ideas and solutions to add to the discussion on mitigating climate change, locally and globally,” Guillemard said.  “Our government is committed to harnessing the energy, passion and perspective of our youth as we implement our Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan with the goal of making Manitoba our country’s cleanest, greenest, most climate-resilient province.  We were pleased to have so many applicants and welcome the involvement and excitement of the young men and women on the new Youth Advisory Council.”

	The province is pleased with the quick response and call for action, and welcomes the involvement and the excitement from young Manitobans interested in the council, the minister noted.  The Manitoba government received over 85 applications and selected nine members who represent the diversity of the province with a commitment for making a difference.  The Youth Advisory Council members are aged 18 to 25, include students and young professionals, come from Winnipeg, Minto, Oakbank, Steinbach, Swan River and Thompson, and speak a total of six languages.

	Members of the youth council will report to the already-established independent Expert Advisory Council, which makes recommendations to the minister of conservation and climate on all aspects of the climate and green plan including the pillars of climate, jobs, water and nature.

	“The Expert Advisory Council looks forward to working with the newly established Youth Advisory Council.  Addressing climate change requires broad action across all economic sectors and collaboration among all Manitobans, businesses, academia and governments,” said Colleen Sklar, chair of the Expert Advisory Council.  “Hearing the voices of youth is essential as we collectively work to provide advice on delivering the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan.”

	The minister said the council will meet in early 2020 to begin its important work.  For more information on the Youth Advisory Council and the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan, visit www.gov.mb.ca/climateandgreenplan/index.html.

FAMILY LAW IMPROVEMENTS HELPING MANITOBANS REDUCE CONFLICT, SAVE MONEY

Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is continuing to make improvements to family law, with the goal of reducing conflict, cost and the effect of separation and divorce on children, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today, noting changes to how child and spousal support are handled will save families an estimated $15 million annually.

	“Modernizing and streamlining the family law system is a massive undertaking,” said Cullen.  “Together, we are working toward an improved system for all Manitoba families, while ensuring that the needs of children affected by divorce and separation remain our top priority.  We can do this by helping families access less adversarial and less costly supports sooner, and by giving them comprehensive resources to make informed decisions.”

	Every year, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 families in Manitoba are affected by separation or divorce.

	Changes to the Maintenance Enforcement Program (MEP) came into effect in July 2019, allowing its staff to make more decisions and gather additional information related to child and spousal support without requiring a court order.  As a result, MEP will be able to review and adjust about 3,000 matters every year outside of the court system.  This is expected to save families an estimated $15 million annually in court and legal fees, the minister said.   

	The Manitoba government has also made changes to allow decisions made by independent family arbitrators to be enforced in the same way as court orders, as of July 2019.  The arbitrator is chosen by family members involved to make decisions in a simpler, less formal process than if they were to go to court.  Arbitration decisions related to child support, spousal or common-law partner support can now be enforced by MEP and custody arrangements can be enforced under The Child Custody Enforcement Act.  Property-related decisions can also be enforced more quickly.

	A new web site launched today at www.manitoba.ca/familylaw/ will connect Manitobans with all of the public, private and community services and organizations that are currently available, alongside clear and accurate information about family law issues.  This online hub will help families complete the prerequisites to apply to court including:


		templates and guidelines to help parents develop their parenting arrangements including sharing parenting time and decision-making responsibilities;

		appropriate resources like arbitration, mediation and dispute resolution services to assist when they cannot resolve their disputes; and

		a tool to help families gather all of the financial disclosure information needed for child and spousal support as well as property division.


	Manitobans who do not have internet access or require additional assistance can call 204-945-2313 or 1-844-808-2313 (toll-free) or emailgetguidance@gov.mb.ca for a personalized response.

	The online hub also includes a public engagement report, which highlights how the province connected with service providers, stakeholders and Manitobans who have in the past, or are currently experiencing separation or divorce, gathering 250 ideas on how to improve the family law system.

	The minister noted the online hub and other resources will continue to be implemented to better support Manitoba families and their children, beginning in early 2020.

	Provincial officials will continue to speak with families who are sharing their experiences to help develop and improve family law services and supports.  This work will also continue to be guided by a collaboration table, a group created earlier this year to help guide the design and development of family law initiatives.  It includes family law service providers and experts from the legal, social service, financial, academic and non-governmental sectors.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is investing $60,000 to expand the highly successful Families and Schools Together (F&ST) program, bringing the total to nine schools benefiting from the initiative, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	“The F&ST program brings multiple families together after school, once per week, so parents can learn skills necessary to care for their children and to be lovingly connected to them,” said Goertzen.  “As part of the expansion, we are also introducing the Baby F&ST program, aimed at children three years of age and under, at two sites.  Baby F&ST is a great program for young, isolated mothers in insecure family environments and challenging circumstances.”

	Goertzen noted the F&ST program has many social and educational benefits including building family resiliency and decreasing the likelihood of future drug addiction by children and current drug use by parents.  The program has been delivered in Winnipeg and various rural areas for more than 25 years by Family Dynamics, a Winnipeg-based agency.

	“Family Dynamics has been delivering the Families and Schools Together program for over two decades because we know it helps families with young children come together in a healthy and safe way,” said Steve Williams, president of the board, Family Dynamics Inc.

	F&ST is in use in 20 countries and in more than 2,000 schools around the world.  The United Nations, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada have recognized the program as an exemplary best practice.

	The funding to expand F&ST comes from the Canada-Manitoba Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement.  This is one of many initiatives undertaken by the Manitoba government to improve access to services for families struggling with mental health and addictions.

	The investment builds on recommendations made in the VIRGO report to the Manitoba government to prioritize funding for an expansion of mental health and addictions services for children and youth.

	On the evening of Feb. 13, Manitoba Finance’s Taxation Special Investigations Unit, along with the Winnipeg Police Service, completed an investigation into the sale of contraband cigarettes at multiple retail locations in Winnipeg.

	Investigators seized 2,050,300 cigarettes not marked for Manitoba Tax purposes.  This was a potential tax loss of $615,090 for the province and is the largest single seizure in the history of the Special Investigation’s Unit.  Along with the cigarettes, the seizure included $93,230 in cash and two motor vehicles.

	Three Winnipeg residents including two adult males and an adult female now face a variety of charges under Manitoba’s Tobacco Tax Act and Tax Administration and Miscellaneous Taxes Act (TAMTA).  For a first-time offence under the provincial tax acts, individuals face fines between $1,000 and $10,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment as well as a potential triple tax penalty.  Two of accused have prior convictions, so they face more stringent penalties under TAMTA including fines between $10,000 and $50,000 and/or up to one-year imprisonment, suspensions of their driver licenses as well as a potential quadruple tax penalty of $2,460,360.  The accused will also face charges under the Criminal Code of Canada.

	After months of preparation and consultation with Manitobans, the provincial government will reveal Budget 2020 on Wednesday, March 11, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“We have compiled a fiscal plan for the year ahead that focuses on the issues that matter most to Manitobans,” said Fielding.  “Our priorities continue to be making life more affordable in our province, while strengthening the public services they depend on and building a brighter future for all Manitobans.”

	Fielding will present the budget one week after the provincial legislature resumes sitting.  He noted the province remains on the right track to financial recovery as the mid-year fiscal update for 2019-20 projected a lowered deficit of $350 million, slightly ahead of plan even after needing to address unanticipated liabilities ignored in the past.  The government remains committed to eliminating the deficit its second term.

	As part of the Budget 2020 consultation process, the province engaged more than 18,000 people across the province.  The finance minister hosted public meetings in Altona, Brandon, Flin Flon, Gimli, Steinbach, Swan River, The Pas, Thompson and Winnipeg as well as stakeholder sessions and two telephone town hall forums.

	“Budget 2020 involved our most ambitious public community consultation schedule to date, which supplied us with valuable feedback and ideas to incorporate into our spending plans,” said Fielding.  “There were many ways for Manitobans to voice their priorities, which include our shared goals of improved health care, community safety and tax relief.”

	Fielding thanked the Manitobans who emailed and mailed submissions and used the online survey and Build a Budget tool at https://engagemb.ca/Budget-2020.

PROVINCE RELEASES FIRST 2020 SPRING THAW OUTLOOK
					  Spring Weather Conditions will Determine Extent of High Water:  Schuler

Watch news conference





	Future snow and spring rain will determine the 2020 spring run-off and potential high water situations along the Red River, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler said today as he released the province’s first Spring Thaw Outlook.

	“Our focus is currently on the Red River, where we are expecting a significant inflow of water from the northern United States, but with favourable weather conditions in Manitoba, we would expect high water levels similar to last spring,” said Schuler.  “The Assiniboine River basin and other rivers are expected to remain mostly in bank, with possible over-bank high water covering agricultural land.”

	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is modelling the current conditions with possible future weather scenarios.  With favourable conditions, forecasters would expect similar water levels to 2019.  Last year, the Red River Floodway was put into service but Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 from Winnipeg south to Emerson remained open.  

	Average weather conditions in spring 2020 would result in water levels similar to 2011 on the Red River, according to forecasters.  In that year, PTH 75 was closed for 29 days.  Unfavourable weather could lead to a run-off nearing 2009 levels.  In 2009, PTH 75 was closed for 37 days.

	Schuler noted the province has invested approximately $65 million in flood mitigation measures through the Red River Valley over the past four years.  Projects include:
	•    raising northbound lanes of PTH 75 south of Morris and improving drainage (construction underway);
	•    reconstructing the Plum River bridge in the northbound lanes of PTH 75 near St. Jean Baptiste;
	•    reconstructing the Marsh River bridge on PTH 23 east of Morris; and
	•    reconstructing the Little Morris River bridge on PR 422 near Rosenfeld.  

	The Hydrologic Forecast Centre plans to release a second Spring Thaw Outlook in late March.  At that time, forecasters will have a more focused assessment of the Red River and will update the forecast based on the most current conditions at that time.

	The Red River in Manitoba is affected by flows from North Dakota and water from the Manitoba portion of the basin.  The river widens as it moves north, naturally flattens and lowers its peak as it moves downstream.

	The first 2020 Spring Thaw Outlook report is available at:

MANITOBA CONTRIBUTES $1.5 MILLION TO UPDATE OAK HAMMOCK MARSH INTERPRETIVE CENTRE


	The Manitoba government is providing a matching contribution of up to $1.5 million to support wetland education and conservation through a campaign to renovate the award-winning Oak Hammock Marsh Interpretive Centre, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen has announced.

	“Oak Hammock Marsh is recognized as a wetland of international importance and its interpretive centre helps visitors to better understand why, while bringing wildlife and people together,” said Pedersen.  “We’re pleased to support the capital campaign to renovate the centre, to ensure Manitobans and visitors from around the world can continue to connect with nature, enjoy and respect Manitoba’s wild areas and learn why we all depend on wetlands.”

	The minister announced Manitoba’s contribution at Ducks Unlimited Canada’s 24th annual Minister’s Dinner yesterday.  The fundraising event brings together more than 230 people in support of the Oak Hammock Marsh Interpretive Centre and its wetland education programs.  The province has committed to $1.5 million in matching funds if $3 million is raised in support of the interpretive centre project.  This funding is in addition to the $225,000 in annual operating funding the interpretive centre receives from the Manitoba government.

	Upgrades to the interpretive centre will be guided by a comprehensive plan that re-imagines the space.  Renovations and enhancements will focus on creatively and strategically highlighting the natural surroundings while leveraging innovative and interactive educational tools. 

	“The opportunity to enhance our space and visitor experience is exciting,” says Karla Guyn, CEO for Ducks Unlimited Canada.  “Since the interpretive centre was built more than 25 years ago, it has provided students and visitors with unique ways to learn about the natural world.  We look forward to finding new ways of connecting people with wetlands within an updated facility.”

	Open year-round, the interpretive centre is used by school groups and tourists and offers a variety of guided programs.  It also features a theatre, a scenic cafe, a gift shop, meeting rooms, rooftop observation deck and interactive exhibits.

	Spearheaded by Harry Enns, former minister of natural resources, and Claude Wilson, former president of Ducks Unlimited Canada, the interpretive centre first opened its doors in 1993.  Since then, Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Manitoba government have worked together to manage the interpretive centre.

	Located east of Stonewall, Oak Hammock Marsh is a 36-square-kilometre marsh that features a restored prairie marsh, aspen-oak bluff, artesian springs and some of Manitoba’s last remaining patches of tall-grass prairie.  Its interpretive centre welcomes close to 100,000 students, tourists and environmental professionals annually who can explore 30 kilometres of trails and lush natural habitat that is home to 25 species of mammals, 300 species of birds, numerous amphibians, reptiles, fish and invertebrates.

MANITOBA SHERIFFS TO EXPAND ROLE IN TRANSPORTING INMATES, PROVIDING COURT SECURITY IN EASTERN MANITOBA
					  Added Sheriff Services Will Help Increase Police Presence in Eastern Manitoba:  Cullen

Watch news conference





	More police officers will be patrolling communities in eastern Manitoba as provincial sheriff’s officers take on full responsibility for transporting inmates to court and providing court security in the region, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“Our government is finding ways to help free up police resources and ensure police officers are able to actively patrol our communities and focus their efforts on crime prevention, intervention and investigation,” said Cullen.  “Sheriff’s officers are already responsible for inmate transportation and court security in other regions and handle their duties with dedication and professionalism.  It is a wise investment to expand their responsibility into eastern Manitoba as part of our broader commitment to public safety.”

	The Manitoba government will invest nearly $2.5 million annually to hire 11 sheriff’s officers in the eastern district and assume responsibility for transportation-related costs, which will include several fleet vehicles as well as flights to communities only accessible by air.  Sheriff’s officers will assume responsibility for transporting inmates to and from circuit court locations in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) eastern district and will also provide security at these locations.  In the past, RCMP officers have been responsible for providing these services.  The transition is expected to be complete in the next six months.

	“Our focus is to keep front-line RCMP officers actively patrolling our rural communities and responding quickly to calls for service,” said Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy, commanding officer of the Manitoba RCMP.  “The addition of 11 sheriff’s officers to transport prisoners and provide court security will ensure that RCMP officers are doing their core policing work and are there for when Manitobans need them most.”

	The eastern district is bounded by Garden Hill in the north, east to the Manitoba-Ontario border, south to the American border and to the east side of Lake Manitoba.  It includes communities such as Altona, Arborg, Berens River, Emerson, Garden Hill, Gimli, Little Grand Rapids, Peguis, Powerview-Pine Falls, Selkirk, St-Pierre-Jolys, Steinbach and Stonewall. 

	Sheriff’s officers are currently responsible for inmate transports and courtroom security in western Manitoba and Winnipeg, and for inmate transportation in the north.  RCMP continue to provide court security in northern Manitoba.

	The minister noted this investment supports the goals of the province’s Policing and Public Safety Strategy and the Safer Streets, Safer Lives Strategy, as it reduces extraneous demands on police resources and ensures RCMP officers are able to focus on front-line policing services in their communities.

	The province continues to support other initiatives that reduce extraneous demands on police resources, which helps ensure more officers are actively serving their communities, the minister noted.  For example, amendments to The Provincial Offences Act came into effect in 2017 to allow written evidence to be submitted to the court by police officers, instead of having to attend hearings and present their evidence in person.  As a result, court attendance by police officers, including Winnipeg Police Service, the RCMP and other police services, has significantly decreased.

	The Manitoba government also recently announced plans to invest $1.9 million to support the expansion of RCMP crime reduction and enforcement teams including a five-member unit for the eastern district.  Crime reduction teams focus on serious, prolific offenders and drug dealers.  The province’s investment will establish a new five-member team in the eastern district, a new five-member team in the western district and support the expansion of an existing northern team.  Additional officers will also join the D Division Enforcement Team, a centralized unit targeting criminal organizations and street gangs that traffic drugs and guns throughout the province.

	The decision to shift transportation and court security responsibilities to sheriff’s officers also builds on the strategic direction set out under Manitoba’s Criminal Justice System Modernization Strategy, which focuses on crime prevention and improving service delivery.

THOMPSON TO HOST NEW FAMILY MEDICINE TRAINING PROGRAM IN NORTHERN MANITOBA
					  Program Will Aid Physician Recruitment Efforts in the North:  Friesen


	A new family medicine residency program in Thompson will allow medical residents to experience northern and remote health-care service delivery and encourage physician recruitment and retention to underserved areas across the large and diverse region, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Providing a program that lets physicians experience life in the north and how people in the region access health care is an excellent way to prepare them for a career in northern medicine,” said Friesen.  “Following the success of similar programs in the other health regions, this new partnership between the University of Manitoba and the Northern Regional Health Authority will support stronger recruitment and retention efforts across northern Manitoba.”

	Upon graduation from medical school, graduates take residency training as family physicians or in a specialty.  The two-year family medicine residency program in the Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Science at the University of Manitoba, includes training in a number of practice areas, such as primary care, psychiatry, obstetrics, general surgery, internal medicine, emergency department care, pediatrics and seniors care.  This training allows family physicians to meet the varied health-care needs of Manitobans in communities across the province.

	The minister noted similar residency programs have proven successful in recruitment and retention of physicians in other regions such as Prairie Mountain Health and Southern Health-Santé Sud.  Most recently, Selkirk became a site for family medicine residency training in the Interlake-Eastern health region in 2019.

	“We’re excited to be expanding into the northern health region with residents living and working in Thompson,” said Dr. José François, medical director of Shared Health’s family medicine program, and head of the Department of Family Medicine at the Max Rady College of Medicine.  “This new site offers residents an opportunity to absorb the rewards of a northern practice and setting while meeting the diverse needs of the communities in and around Thompson.”

	While the program is based out of Thompson, trainees will complete core training rotations across the region, preparing residents to provide care across diverse environments including community hospitals, health centres, nursing stations and care homes in First Nation, rural and remote communities.

	Addressing the unique health needs and inequities of Indigenous populations in the region is a core skill for family physicians working in the north.  The 2016 census data shows that 71 per cent of the people living in the northern health region self-identify as Indigenous.

	The university has redistributed two of its seats from the family medicine northern and remote stream residency program basing it in Thompson.  Medical residents will be selected for these training opportunities through the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) for positions beginning in July 2020.

	The residency program provides an excellent opportunity for trainees to gain effective cultural safety proficiency, become involved in advocacy and self-reflection by learning alongside preceptors, education partners, knowledge keepers, local leaders and the patients of the Northern Regional Health Authority.

	“We believe this program will help physicians better understand the opportunities they can find while practising in northern Manitoba,” said Helga Bryant, chief executive officer Northern Regional Health Authority.  “Our medical teams are very excited to provide training opportunities for new physicians, while enhancing access to care for northern residents.”

					  Provincial Operations Underway on Assiniboine and Red Rivers


	Manitoba Infrastructure is urging people to be careful while venturing onto all rivers and streams in the province at this time of year, as temperature fluctuations could result in ice that is thinner than expected.

	Manitoba’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is reporting the outflow from Shellmouth Reservoir is gradually decreasing as part of normal operations to maintain the desired spring and summer level on the reservoir.

	The current outflow is being reduced to 100 cubic feet per second (cfs) from 500 cfs, which will result in a two-to-three foot water level decrease on the Assiniboine River from Shellmouth to the town of Russell, and one to two ft. from Russell to Brandon.  The decrease will amount to between zero and one ft. as the lower river flow reaches Winnipeg in about two weeks.

	The province will continue to monitor conditions on the upper Assiniboine River, as well as downstream river levels, and may revise the outflow if conditions change.   

	Meanwhile, the ice-jam mitigation program has started on the Red River north of Winnipeg.  Ice cutting is underway, with the Amphibex fleet and support equipment being transported north of Selkirk to begin the first section of icebreaking near Netley Lake today.

	The construction of the Lake Manitoba / Lake St. Martin Outlet Channels is one of our government’s top priorities.

	We are committed to continuing a meaningful and respectful consultation process with Indigenous communities who will be affected by this important climate-change mitigation project.

	Building positive, respectful and inclusive partnerships with Indigenous people and communities is fundamental to enhancing and increasing Indigenous participation in Manitoba’s economy, and it is also critically important for advancing reconciliation through a principled approach.

	Manitoba has engaged with all 39 Indigenous communities and groups that are potentially impacted; we have 1,083 individual records of communication and have held 139 meetings with Indigenous communities and groups in regards to this project.  The Manitoba government has already spent more than $650,000 on engagement and consultation.

	Currently, we are working with the federal government through a conformity review process regarding the Environmental Impact Statement.  Once the federal government approves the statement, the project will be advanced to the technical review stage and the next phase of consultation will begin.

	Manitoba is in the process of signing consultation agreements with communities for this next phase, and to date, has signed consultation agreements with Lake St. Martin First Nation and the following Interlake Reserves Tribal Council (IRTC) communities:  Dauphin River First Nation, Lake Manitoba First Nation and Kinonjeoshetoegon First Nation.  Six more agreements are currently being finalized.

	This next phase will build upon our ongoing dialogue with communities and will follow the requirements laid out in both provincial and federal consultation processes.

	We are committed to getting this project built, and we are committed to doing so in a way that respects and meaningfully engages Indigenous communities in consultation.

MASTER PLAN TO BE DEVELOPED FOR HEALTH SCIENCES CENTRE WINNIPEG CAMPUS

Backgrounder
Background Information


	One of the largest and most significant initiatives in Manitoba’s health system, a master capital plan, will be developed for Health Sciences Centre (HSC) Winnipeg’s campus.  The plan will ensure clinical services and partner organizations are well aligned throughout the site’s future development, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“HSC is Manitoba’s hospital and is the province’s tertiary centre for trauma, transplants, burns, neurosciences, complex cancer care, and delivers the most specialized care for adults and children,” said Friesen.

	The master plan will include an inventory of campus facilities and clinical services, and will consider what shifts in the location of specific clinical services will support the site’s ability to meet both current and future population needs.

	“Our government is making significant capital investments at HSC including the new Ambulatory Care Clinic, the opening of Women’s Hospital, the Acute Stroke Unit and the Mental Health Crisis Response Centre.  Therefore, it is essential to have the comprehensive view of the development of the campus,” said Friesen.

	Partner organizations across the HSC campus along with the Health Sciences Centre Foundation, CancerCare Manitoba Foundation and Children’s Hospital Foundation will be consulted as part of the process to ensure the long-term capital needs of all stakeholders including Cadham Provincial Laboratory, CancerCare Manitoba and the University of Manitoba are considered in the development of the overall plan, Friesen added.

	The HSC campus encompasses 39 acres of land with more than four million square feet of occupied space.  Its boundaries are Notre Dame Avenue to the south, Sherbrook Street to the east, William Avenue to the north and Tecumseh Street to the west.

	“Any campus redevelopment must take into account the priorities and population health needs of Manitobans,” said Dr. Brock Wright, president and CEO, Shared Health.  “A longer-term approach to the clinical services we provide and the physical infrastructure we share with our partners will ensure that we are able to meet the needs of Manitoba patients, both today and into the future.”

	The minister noted this will be the first in a series of master planning efforts for the health-care system and aligns with the work of the provincial clinical plan.

	“Unlike the former government, we recognize the importance of thoughtful, long-term planning, particularly in health care,” said Friesen.  “These reviews will look at changes in health-care delivery models to ensure we are working together as a province to provide better health care sooner for all Manitobans.”

MANITOBA LAUNCHES FIRST STEP IN FORAGE INSURANCE REVIEW


	Consultations with forage and livestock producers and organizations to review and shape Manitoba’s forage insurance programming are now available online, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“Manitoba forage producers have had back-to-back challenging production years and only a small proportion of forage acres are insured when compared to annual crops,” Pedersen said.  “To bridge that gap, we need to better understand the risks, challenges and effectiveness of the current program to help ensure it meets their needs over the longer term.”

	Producers have the opportunity to provide their thoughts on the current program and suggest changes that will support growth of Manitoba’s livestock sector through an online survey on https://engagemb.ca/.  Contributions will help inform government on how the current forage insurance platform is being used, its limitations and what changes need to be considered.

	The review will include a number of in-person engagement sessions in March to build on the dialogue.  The consultant for the review will work with producers and associations to identify priorities to be considered when developing or redesigning the forage insurance platform.  

	To take part in the online survey, visit the Forage Insurance Review at https://engagemb.ca/forage-insurance-review or visit one of the public kiosks available at the following Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development locations and contact the office to schedule an appointment:  
	•    Vita – 108 Main St. N, 204-425-5050;
	•    Carberry – junction of the Trans-Canada Highway and PTH 5, north on PTH 5, 204-834-8815;
	•    Virden – 247 Wellington St. W, 204-748-4770;
	•    Swan River – 120 Sixth Ave. N, 204-734-3417;

	Premier Brian Pallister and Grand Chief Arlen Dumas, Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC), today signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to formalize discussions toward an agreement on the transfer of the province’s northern airports and marine operations to First Nations ownership and operation.

	“The Manitoba government continues to support the creation of First Nations-led partnerships and ventures and this is the first formal step in developing a viable ownership model and sustainable business plan for a First Nations-led northern airports authority,” said Pallister. “Such an agreement would give First Nations independence in controlling the transportation infrastructure they depend on daily and benefit northern economies. This is a critical step toward furthering true reconciliation in Manitoba.”

	The province’s Northern Airports and Marine Operations (NAMO) has a network of 23 airports and five marine facilities. The network covers an area of Manitoba from Selkirk north to Sayisi Dene First Nation and from Brochet east to Shamattawa First Nation. The northern airports and ferry infrastructure provides a lifeline for remote communities, as it enables the transportation of medical patients, essential supplies such as food and medication, and provincial service staff from several departments.

	Throughout the negotiation process, the premier committed to maintaining this vital service at current or improved levels, and finding a solution that ensures uninterrupted, reliable and cost-effective services for all Manitobans who rely on them.

	“The AMC leadership has been resolute for many years on the need for improved transport infrastructure, including air services, for our First Nations across our traditional territories,” said Dumas. “Discussions with government officials and representatives from the private sector on the creation of a Manitoba First Nations Airport Authority represent a critical first step towards First Nations control of air transport and marine infrastructure. On behalf of the AMC, I commend the premier and Province of Manitoba for their efforts at strengthening our relationship through economic reconciliation.”

	Building on the sale of Grace Lake Airport near The Pas to Missinippi Airways in 2019, the province expanded its discussions with Indigenous partners through the AMC to consider transferring assets, ownership and operations of NAMO to the jurisdiction of Manitoba’s First Nations.

	“The Barren Lands First Nation welcomes this important announcement as a sign of good faith by the Province of Manitoba,” said Chief John Clarke. “I applaud my colleagues within the AMC leadership for their vision and determination for First Nations-led transport independence, and recognize the political will of the government of Manitoba for joining us at the discussion table for joint planning on the way forward for Manitoba First Nations air transport infrastructure.”    

	The province and AMC will work diligently in the coming months in hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with a smooth transition of assets beginning this summer.

	Information on AMC is available at https://manitobachiefs.com/.

PROVINCE INVESTS IN CLEAN WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE


	PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE—The Manitoba government will provide more than $61 million to support the upgrade of the City of Portage la Prairie’s Water Pollution Control Facility, Premier Brian Pallister announced here today.

	“The area around Portage la Prairie has seen new and established agri-business investments in the community, leading to direct job creation and ongoing population growth that is expected to continue,” said Pallister.  “This investment will bring waste-water treatment for the city and surrounding areas into compliance with provincial and federal regulations, and will benefit Manitoba’s lakes and waterways.  Our government anticipates the positive long-term contributions this investment will bring to the region.”

	The City of Portage la Prairie owns and operates the Water Pollution Control Facility, a waste-water treatment plant that provides treatment for municipal and industrial waste water before it is discharged into the Assiniboine River.  The facility also serves the region’s agri-business industry, which includes pea processing plants Nutri-Pea Ltd. and Roquette and a potato-processing plant operated by McCain Foods.

	“Upgrades to Portage la Prairie’s Water Pollution Control Facility will modernize waste-water infrastructure for the local community, safeguarding the well-being of Manitoba’s families and will support the area’s growing agri-business functions,” said Mayor Irvine Ferris, City of Portage la Prairie.  “Investing in the expansion of Portage la Prairie’s waste-water infrastructure provides an exciting opportunity to improve our environmental footprint and support the unprecedented economic growth in the area.”

	The premier noted that historic partnerships with these major industry leaders in food processing have resulted in unparalleled investment to the province’s agricultural industry, creating jobs, establishing stronger markets for Canadian farmers and providing a significant boost to Manitoba’s economy.

	The Manitoba government continues to deliver strategic investments in community infrastructure to help facilitate growth and improve quality of life in the province. By improving waste-water management, the City of Portage la Prairie and service areas will be better able to meet federal and provincial waste-water regulations and provide a cleaner environment to the area’s existing and future population.

	Funding for the expansion of the facility is being provided through the Investing in Canada Plan. Other partners in the project include the Government of Canada and the City of Portage la Prairie, which are providing more than $60 million and $59 million respectively.

	Construction is expected to begin in summer 2022, the premier added.

MANITOBA SEES LARGEST MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT INCREASE IN MORE THAN A DECADE
					  6,500 More Manitobans Working in January Shows Government is Moving Manitoba Forward: Pallister

Watch news conference





	There were approximately 6,500 more Manitobans working in January than the month prior, new monthly employment statistics show, resulting in the province’s largest month-over-month increase in more than a decade, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“The latest employment numbers indicate the highest employment growth in the province since April 2008, evidence that our government is moving Manitoba forward,” said Pallister. “We continue to create a business-friendly environment and our plan to grow the private sector for the benefit of all Manitobans is working.”

	According to the latest figures from Statistics Canada, the increase in employment in January was accompanied by a decline in Manitoba’s unemployment rate to 5.1 per cent, down from 5.3 per cent in 2019. Manitoba now has the second-lowest unemployment rate in Canada.

	The province’s labour force has increased by 1.1 per cent, while the country’s rate as a whole increased by 0.1 per cent.

	Manitoba is a leader with amongst the highest per-capita private-sector investment growth across the country, according to Statistics Canada. The premier noted the growth and business confidence in Manitoba shows the success of the government’s Economic Growth Action Plan, a plan to create 40,000 jobs in the province over the next four years.

	The new provincial Economic Development Office is emphasizing teamwork, improved co-ordination, reduced duplication and the elimination of red tape to help create clear pathways for investors and entrepreneurs.

	“The premier has led the way in the fight to break down siloes, reduce trade barriers and lower taxes, and our government continues to create a business-friendly environment that has led to the largest month-over-month employment increase in Manitoba in more than 10 years,” said Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler. “We continue to remove obstacles to economic growth and investment to move Manitoba forward.”

	Manitoba’s employment level increased by 6,500, which amounts to a one per cent increase, above the 0.2 per cent increase for the rest of the country as a whole. Full-time employment in Manitoba grew by about 1,500 in January.

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY SERVICES EXPANDING TO SELKIRK
					  Addition of Cardiac Scans Reflects Government's Commitment to Offer Specialized Services Outside of Winnipeg: Friesen

Watch news conference





	SELKIRK—Echocardiography services will be offered at the Selkirk Regional Health Centre starting next week, allowing residents living in the region to access care closer to home while continuing to reduce province-wide wait times for the diagnostic scan, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“We are committed to providing better health care sooner for all Manitobans,” said Friesen. “Adding echocardiography services in Selkirk will build on our work to improve wait times, and allow more patients in the Interlake region to obtain this specialized service where they live.”

	Almost 3,000 patients per year from the Interlake region travel to Winnipeg to receive echocardiograms. Nearly 24 per cent of residents in the region live with hypertension, higher than the provincial average of 20.7 per cent, making the new site an ideal location for the service to be expanded.

	Echocardiograms provide an ultrasound for the heart and can offer a timely diagnosis for various forms of heart disease. Once fully operational, up to 1,620 scans per year will be performed at the new site, which will begin accepting patients this Wednesday.

	All scans performed in Selkirk will be non-urgent and elective, with the results interpreted by cardiologists at Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg (HSC). Urgent or complex scans will continue to be referred to HSC or St. Boniface Hospital.

	“This community-led initiative builds upon our health system’s capacity to offer specialized services outside of Winnipeg and addresses a regional need for this service,” said Ron van Denakker, chief executive officer, Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority (IERHA). “We are pleased that the Rotary Club of Selkirk worked with us as they undertook their Project Echo fundraising campaign to help more patients receive this service closer to home.”

	Adding echocardiography services in Selkirk is only the latest in a sustained effort by the Manitoba government to improve provincial wait times for non-urgent and elective scans, the minister noted. Last spring, seven cardiac sonographer positions were added at HSC and St. Boniface Hospital, which has reduced non-urgent and elective wait times by more than 33 per cent since May 2019.

	“Echocardiograms are important tests that assist in the diagnosis of various heart conditions,” said Dr. Brock Wright, chief executive officer, Shared Health. “Expanding the service to Selkirk will align with recommendations made in Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan to build up local capacity for specialized services and enable rural and northern patients the ability to receive the care they need without having to travel to Winnipeg.”

	Shared Health and the IERHA have hired a full-time cardiac sonographer and clerk to support the new unit, which will be located in previously-unused space at the newly-constructed health centre.

	The Rotary Club of Selkirk raised approximately $200,000 to purchase the medical equipment required to bring echocardiography services to the region. Eleven different municipalities throughout the health region contributed to the project, as did 31 community groups, local businesses, Hutterite colonies and dozens of individuals.

	“The continued improvement of health services is important to all Manitobans, including those of us who live in the Interlake-Eastern RHA,” said Jean Oliver, vice-president of the Rotary Club of Selkirk and co-chair of Project Echo. “We are thrilled to partner on this meaningful initiative that will have a positive impact on the heart health of Interlake-Eastern communities and all Manitobans.”

	Manitoba has seen recent success in other specialized services. Wait times for hip and knee replacements and cardiac surgeries have reduced significantly since the fall of 2018, when the government invested an additional $5.3 million to perform additional procedures.  Since that time, wait times for hip and knee surgeries have improved by more than 21 per cent year-over-year. Similarly, waits for cataract surgeries have improved province-wide.

MANITOBA INVESTS IN RESEARCH PROJECT TO SUPPORT HEALTH SYSTEM DECISION-MAKING DATA NEEDS
					  Project to Ensure Health System Has Access to Quality Data to Support Patients, Ensure Quality Care: Friesen


	The Manitoba government is investing more than $2.4 million over four years for three applied research projects to enhance real-time access to the data health-care providers need to make informed decisions when caring for patients, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Health-care providers need timely access to information so we can maximize the benefits and deliver better health care sooner for Manitobans,” said Friesen.  “Investing in this research will help us find ways to ensure clinical providers have access to the data they need to make more informed decisions about patient care, which supports the implementation of Manitoba’s provincial clinical and preventive services plan.”

	This project also receives funding support through Canada’s Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) Rewarding Success initiative. The Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) and the province of Manitoba will each invest $600,000 annually over four years to support work on the project.

	“This project demonstrates the power of research in improving the health of Canadians and enhancing the health care experience for patients while making health care systems more effective and efficient,” said Dr. Tammy Clifford, vice president, research programs, CIHR. “This is an excellent example of a collaborative effort supported through our SPOR program.”
	 
	Three physicians at the University of Manitoba are leading the project, each focusing on a different area of health care and how timely access to data can be used to:
	• create efficiencies to reduce the need for blood transfusions and ensure appropriate care is provided during surgeries;
	• enhance the use of home dialysis to ensure care is delivered closer to home for rural patients; and
	• enhance navigation to health care for cancer patients to ensure timely access to care, particularly in rural and northern Manitoba.

	“Mindset, the Manitoba integrated data platform, will transform how patients and providers access, and are informed by, health data,” said team lead Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, associate professor of medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine and senior scientist, Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology. “Developed with diverse stakeholders, including patients and the Government of Manitoba and the federal government, the province-wide platform will be the first of its kind in Canada and transformational for our province. It will help promote the efficient functioning and sustainability of our health system and will improve the lives of all Manitobans.”

	The minister noted these projects will inform how data is collected and used in real time as the province’s health-system transformation moves forward.

	“As we develop one system for data collection, information management and analysis, it’s important to find out what kind of data is needed and how it can be provided in more timely ways so that we can support patients and ensure quality care,” said Friesen. “This project will guide our investments in this area in the months and years ahead and allow us to maximize the benefits as we continue to transform the health care system, and provide Manitobans what they have long deserved, better health care sooner.”

	The SPOR Rewarding Success initiative was established in 2017 to address complex health problems. The initiative provides funding in a way similar to social impact bonds, where a portion of any economic benefits from research projects are reinvested to conduct further research studies.

	Anglers will not need an angling licence to try their luck during this year’s Winter Family Fishing Weekend from Feb. 15 to 17, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“There are endless fishing opportunities to be found throughout Manitoba, and ice fishing is a great way to spend time with friends and family outdoors,” said Pedersen.  “We encourage all Manitobans and visiting anglers to take advantage of our amazing fisheries free of charge.”

	Anglers will be able to fish without a licence provincewide except in national parks where a federal licence will still be required.  Conservation limits apply to those fishing without a licence.  Anglers should be sure conditions are safe before venturing onto the ice.  It is important to let someone know where you are fishing and to wear appropriate clothing so the ice-fishing experience will be enjoyable.

	Manitobans are reminded that when fishing in an Aquatic Invasive Species Control Zone, all live bait must be discarded before leaving the shoreline.  Commercially supplied dead bait that has not come into contact with water from a waterbody in an Aquatic Invasive Species Control Zone can be retained by anglers for future use.  More information on aquatic invasive species ca be found at:
www.manitoba.ca/StopAIS.

	Pedersen noted the province is also offering free park entry for the entire month of February.  Vehicle permits are not required in any provincial park.

PROVINCE LAUNCHES $3-MILLION FLOOD PROTECTION PROGRAM FOR MUNICIPALITIES


	The Manitoba government is offering support to municipalities to enhance spring flooding preparations and protections, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires announced today.

	“We want to help municipalities take steps to prevent the kind of significant damage flooding can cause to their communities,” Squires said.  “Municipalities know best what will work for them and this program is designed to help them ensure protection put in place this year will benefit their communities for many years to come.”

	Under the program, municipalities can be reimbursed for up to 100 per cent of approved flood preparedness or resiliency projects and equipment costs.  The maximum funding available for each municipality will be based on the total value of all approved proposals, but up to $150,000 may be available for each municipal proposal.  Consideration will be given for funding of up to $500,000 for the City of Winnipeg should flood risk warrant additional investment.

	“The Association of Manitoba Municipalities (AMM) welcomes the provincial government’s investment to enhance municipal capacity when responding to flood threats,” said Ralph Groening, president, AMM.  “This funding support saves money in avoided flood damages, helps municipalities better prepare, and also builds resiliency for future floods.”

	“It’s great to see programs like this offer incentives for preparedness,” said Colleen Sklar, executive director, Winnipeg Metropolitan Region (WMR).  “This kind of co-ordinated effort, with the inclusion of groups such as AMM and WMR, is critical to flood prevention and protection for years to come.”

	Proposals will be reviewed by a panel made up of representatives from the Association of Manitoba Municipalities, Winnipeg Metropolitan Region and the province.  Evaluation of proposals will consider factors including flood risk, ability of the proposal to enhance emergency preparedness or resiliency for future flood events, as well as potential regional benefits.  Proposals must be submitted by Feb. 28.

MANITOBA ACCEPTS HIGHEST NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS IN PROVINCE'S HISTORY


	The number of immigrant landings in Manitoba in 2019 reached 18,905, the highest for any year in the province’s 150-year history, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“As a significant driver of economic and population growth, immigration is shaping the future of this province.  It is a critical tool in Manitoba’s Economic Growth Action Plan to ensure we reach our goal of creating 40,000 jobs over the next four years, moving Manitoba forward,” said Eichler.  “The historic number of immigrant landings in our province last year includes 12,545 arrivals through the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program, which our government has improved and streamlined to greatly reduce a backlog of applications with dedicated resources and increased admission spaces.”

	New year-end federal immigration data shows the record-breaking number in 2019 represents 5.5 per cent of Canada’s admissions of immigrants that year.  The Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program is the primary pathway for 65 per cent of immigrants to the province.

	Close to 75 per cent of newcomers who land in Manitoba are of working age and contribute significantly to Manitoba’s labour force growth.  Within the past five years, 88 per cent of the labour force growth in the province has resulted directly from immigration in response to Manitoba’s increasing demand for workers.

	Many Manitoba employers and growing industries such as information technology are increasingly reliant on expertise and talent from outside Canada, as the worker-to-retiree ratio narrows and birth rates stabilize or fall.

	“By working in collaboration with the business community, post-secondary institutions, other levels of government and invested stakeholders, Manitoba will continue to spur innovation while developing a competitive edge, growing and attracting top talent domestically and abroad,” said Eichler.  “Immigration will continue to bring newcomers to the province and build a thriving economy for all Manitobans.”

PROVINCE LAUNCHING RESEARCH PROJECT TO REDUCE WILDLIFE PREDATION OF LIVESTOCK
					  More than 2,000 Livestock Lost Annually Due to Predation:  Pedersen


	The Manitoba government is launching a three-year applied research project to identify and test ways to reduce economic loss from wildlife predation of cattle and sheep herds, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“Wildlife predation of commercial livestock is a significant problem for Manitoba producers, with more than 2,000 commercial animals lost each year,” said Pedersen.  “This results in significant economic losses to producers, as well as higher costs to Manitobans through their share of compensation under the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program funded by the federal and provincial governments.”

	The Manitoba government will provide a grant up to $300,000 over three years for the Livestock Predation Prevention Project, which will be developed and led by the Livestock Predation Protection Working Group.  Members of the group include Manitoba Beef Producers, Manitoba Sheep Association, Manitoba Goat Association, Manitoba Trappers Association, Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development, Manitoba Agricultural Services Corporation, and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

	“Manitoba Beef Producers has long advocated for strategies to reduce the risk of negative wildlife-livestock interaction and conflict, and we are pleased to see this important project moving forward,” said Dianne Riding, president, Manitoba Beef Producers.  “Predation-related challenges pose a significant concern for Manitoba’s livestock producers, who pride themselves on providing quality animal care and husbandry.  This project will help improve the understanding of the risks, and work toward developing effective prevention and mitigation methods to reduce future losses.”

	The project’s key activities will be:
	•    conducting on-farm predation risk assessments and planning in consultation with producers,
	•    testing on-farm predation prevention and removal practices, and
	•    sharing information with producers about management practices and research project results.

	Pedersen noted the research project will target the highest-known predation areas and emerging problem areas.  Currently, the highest incidence of predation is in the northern Interlake and Parkland regions.

	The governments of Canada and Manitoba currently provide compensation to affected producers through the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program, up to a maximum of $3,000 per animal.  This program has paid producers an average of more than $1.8 million annually in compensation in recent years.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON PORTAGE OVERPASS REPLACEMENT


	The provincial government is hosting a public open house to review options for a new overpass west of Portage la Prairie at the Trans-Canada Highway and Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 1A, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“This traffic exchange is a key part of the Trans-Canada Highway network, an important route for Manitoba’s economy and tourism,” said Schuler.  “The deteriorating bridge has exceeded its design life at 50 years old and needs to be replaced to ensure vehicles will pass through the area in a safe and timely manner.”

	The open house is scheduled for 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 26 at Stride Place, 245 Royal Rd. South in Portage la Prairie.

	The session will give motorists and residents the opportunity to discuss safety enhancements, potential access modifications and temporary detours, as well as land-use plans and development in the municipality and surrounding area.

	In March 2018, the province announced plans to replace the bridge, built in 1968 as part of the Trans-Canada Highway bypass around Portage la Prairie.  The low structure is below modern height standards and several vehicles have collided with the bridge in recent years.  Damage has reduced traffic to one lane over the bridge and diverted vehicles through the city route.

	The province is developing a new overpass design that will improve traffic operations, enhance safety at ramp entrances and exists, and resolve operational and safety issues.

	Manitoba Infrastructure is planning a second open house in early April to present its preferred design alternative and is conducting a public engagement process with local governments, impacted landowners and stakeholders.

	The province plans complete its interchange study later this spring, the minister said, adding construction is planned for June 2021 to November 2022.

NOVEL CORONAVIRUS BULLETIN #2

Watch news conference





	Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living and public health officials are reminding Manitobans that the risk of getting the novel coronavirus in Manitoba remains low.  Manitoba officials continue to work closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor the situation as it evolves.

	As of Feb. 5, 10 tests have been completed for the novel coronavirus in Manitoba.  At this time, there are no laboratory-confirmed cases here.

	Suspected and confirmed cases of novel coronavirus are required to be reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.  To date, five cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in Canada.  All confirmed cases are in Ontario and British Columbia.

	In light of the evolving knowledge of the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus, PHAC is recommending that travellers who have been in the province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, self-isolate for 14 days following arrival in Canada.  PHAC is also recommending that travellers returning from the rest of mainland China self-monitor for 14 days following arrival in Canada.

	Early evidence indicates the novel coronavirus can cause a range of mild to severe symptoms.  It is possible that individuals will not recognize when they first develop symptoms because they can be similar to a cold or flu.

	The steps to limit contact with others if you are self-isolating include:
	•    avoiding individuals with chronic conditions, compromised immune systems and senior citizens;  
	•    avoiding having visitors to your home;
	•    avoiding situations such as social gatherings, work, school, daycare, health-care facilities and seniors residences;
	•    avoiding taking public transit, taxis and ride sharing;  
	•    washing your hands often with soap and warm water frequently for at least 15 to 20 seconds; and
	•    covering your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing.

	If recent travellers develop a fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in the 14 days following their departure from province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, or from the rest of mainland China or if they have been in contact with a case who has, and they are seeking health care, it is important to call ahead.  Individuals can call to their local urgent care centre or emergency department or Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free).

	At this time, public health officials are not recommending use of masks in public places, as there is no evidence that wearing masks significantly reduces the risk of getting the virus.

	Common prevention measures for viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, influenza and others.  include regular hand washing with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  It is important to clean your hands:
	•    after coughing or sneezing;
	•    when caring for a sick person;
	•    before, during and after food preparation;
	•    before eating;
	•    after toilet use; and
	•    when hands are visibly dirty.

	Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.

	PHAC has issued travel health notices about coronavirus.  For more information, visit https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/210?_ga=2.260947853.1094428749.1578423601-32662530.1555003301.

	For links to more information, visit the Manitoba public health website at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/diseases/coronavirus.html.  

	For health questions or more information on respiratory illness, Manitobans can phone Health Links–Info Santé at 788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free).

Français

February  7, 2020
PROVINCE REMOVES SPRING ROAD RESTRICTIONS ON SEVERAL ROADWAYS


	The Manitoba government has removed spring weight restrictions on some roads and reduced others following a comprehensive review, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“Last fall, we completed a review of weight-restricted roads on the provincial highway network to better focus on local industry and economic needs,” said Schuler.  “Removing or reducing weight restrictions from several sections of road will reduce the administrative burden on transportation carriers applying for permits and remove regulatory red tape.  These changes are designed to help make Manitoba highways safer and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions since fewer trips will be needed to haul products.”

	Spring weight restrictions protect Manitoba’s surfaced roads from excessive damage by reducing the axle weights of heavy commercial vehicles, as the spring thaw can significantly reduce road foundation strength.  The province determines spring road restrictions through data collection and analysis from the previous year.  Manitoba Infrastructure (MI) can impose new road restrictions based on current conditions, as well as remove or reduce existing restrictions based on road improvements.

	In consultation with industry, MI periodically revises its policies and procedures to reflect current transportation trends, industry needs and weather patterns.  This year, it considered new criteria for changes on restricted roads, including pavement condition and traffic level, which resulted in more removals and reductions than the past few years.

	The province has removed restrictions on:
	•    Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 21 from the north junction of Provincial Road (PR) 355 to First Avenue in Shoal Lake;
	•    PR 206 from the south junction of PR 210 to the north junction of PR 210 in Landmark;
	•    PR 210 from PR 207 to PTH 12;
	•    PR 247 from PR 334 to PTH 3;
	•    PR 272 from PTH 20 to Duck Bay;
	•    PR 285 from PTH 10 to Sinclair Road;
	•    PR 326 from PR 329 to the east junction River Road in Arborg; and
	•    Sperring Avenue for 2.9 km south and west of PR 202 in Birds Hill.

	The province has reduced spring restriction levels from 65 per cent to 90 per cent of normal loading weight on:
	•    PTH 34 from PTH 1 to PTH 16;
	•    PR 244 from PTH 3 to PTH 23;
	•    PR 248 from PTH 1 to PTH 26;
	•    PR 305 from 11.3 km north of PTH 2 to the Assiniboine River;
	•    PR 422 from PTH 23 to PR 205;
	•    PR 428 from PTH 23 to PTH 14; and
	•    PR 643 (St. Laurent access) from the south junction of PTH 6 to 2.6 km west.

	The province has not added any new restrictions for spring 2020.

	Based on thawing in designated climate zones, spring road restrictions are generally in place from early March until early June.  Motor carriers, farmers, businesses and other interested parties can learn more about spring road restrictions at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/srr/index.html.

PROVINCE BUILDS ON COMMITMENT TO INCREASE HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE RECYCLING


	In support of the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan, the Manitoba government is working to develop an appliance stewardship program to increase recycling of household appliances, including ‘whitegoods’, Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard announced today.

	“We all know that recycling is critical to the protection of our environment and will help sustain the long-term viability of landfills across the province,” Guillemard said.  “Encouraging Manitobans to make small changes in their homes can have a lasting impact on our environment.  As identified in our Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan, whitegoods management is an important step in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.”

	This program would include whitegoods products containing refrigerants such as Freon or other ozone-depleting substances including appliances such as refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners and dehumidifiers.   This initiative will further reduce the province’s greenhouse-gas emissions, which will help Manitoba meet its emission reduction targets, the minister noted.

	“Every household in the province has whitegoods, whether it be a fridge, a freezer, a dehumidifier, a water cooler or an air-conditioning unit, and the improper disposal of these items leads to the release of more unwanted greenhouse gases and a negative impact on the environment,” said Dany Robidoux, executive director, Eco-West Canada.  “We are proud to be working with the province to put in place a Whitegoods Stewardship and Recycling Program that will help grow the zero-waste economy, reduce the amount of stockpiled whitegoods at landfills, create jobs for the benefit of all Manitobans.”

	Manitoba plans to modernize the regulatory framework for waste diversion and recycling to manage end-of-life whitegoods, by the end of 2021, Guillemard noted.

	The province will build on the existing network of provincial recycling programs and working with industry, municipalities and other stewardship organizations, propose to develop a plan to introduce industry-funded stewardship programs for all corded appliances by 2022, the minister added.

Background Information


	The Manitoba government has selected five leading-edge businesses to receive more than $350,000 through the new Innovation Growth Program, an investment which will help them develop and commercialize new, innovative products and services, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“This investment will help small and medium-sized Manitoba businesses develop their products, expand their workforce and help grow Manitoba’s economy over the long term,” said Eichler.  “The Innovation Growth Program provides support to businesses that are pursuing innovation and new opportunities, building on Manitoba’s many economic strengths.  Together, we are making a stronger and more prosperous province for us all now and into the future.”
	 
	The first recipients of funding through the Innovation Growth Program are:
	•    Evolution Wheel;
	•    Aquatic Life;
	•    TRAINFO Corporation;
	•    Creative Applications for Sustainable Technologies Inc.; and
	•    SolarSkyrise.

	“With assistance from the Manitoba government through the Innovation Growth Program, Evolution Wheel is able to shift our innovation and project developments into high gear,” said Derek Hird, CEO of Evolution Wheel.  “Innovation is the key to success for Manitoba-based manufacturing companies to be competitive on an international scale.  Through programs like this, we are able to shorten our development timelines so we can get to market faster and scale our internal hiring.”

	Eichler noted these businesses are the first to receive grants under the Innovation Growth Program. The five companies receiving grants are forecasting a total addition of 272 new full-time jobs and 45 part-time jobs over the next five years.  The Innovation Growth Program is cost-shared with recipients, while the Province of Manitoba provides up to 50 per cent of total project costs.

	These projects will also lend support to the Manitoba Works Plan to create 40,000 new jobs across the province over the next four years, while also supporting the Made-in-Manitoba Climate and Green Plan by assisting companies that are developing technologies in clean tech areas.

	The Innovation Growth Program was launched in June 2019 as a key element of Manitoba’s Economic Growth Action Plan.

	Applications for the next program intake will be accepted until March 16.

					  Manitoba Seeks Improved Participation in Forage Insurance Program:  Pedersen


	Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development is launching a review to better understand the purchasing decisions of Manitoba producers when it comes to forage insurance products available through Manitoba Agricultural Services Corporation (MASC), Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“Manitoba forage producers have had back-to-back challenging production years,” said Pedersen.  “We also know that a relatively small proportion of forage acres are insured, compared to annual crops.  To bridge that gap, we need to better understand their risks, challenges and how the current program does or does not meet their needs.”

	MASC offers various insurance and lending products to agricultural producers in Manitoba including forage insurance.  More than 1,200 producers currently have forage insurance, representing more than 272,000 acres.  This represents about 18 per cent of the more than 1.5 million eligible acres in Manitoba.  For comparison, about 90 per cent of annual crop acreage is insured through MASC.

	Mike Lesiuk, a former provincial director of agricultural policy, will lead the review.  It will ask forage producers for their perceptions about insurance products, how they currently manage risks and how the program can evolve to support growth in Manitoba’s livestock sector.

	The review will also include an environmental scan of other programs available in Canada and related research.  Recommendations will be provided to MASC and the minister later this spring.

	The forage insurance review will engage producers, producer groups and other stakeholders.

PROVINCE RELEASES BASINS CONDITION REPORT


	The Manitoba government is releasing a Basins Condition Report to provide a snapshot of soil moisture and river levels across the province at this time, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“The report will present Red River and Assiniboine River basin conditions as of late January,” said Schuler.  “The actual extent of spring run-off is still largely dependent on weather conditions between now and April.”

	As noted in the Fall Conditions Report, soil moisture levels range from well-above average in southeast Manitoba including the Red River Valley, southwest and southeast Manitoba to near normal in northern Manitoba.  In the United States portion of the Red River watershed, soil moisture levels were at record high levels.

	Since November 2019, precipitation is tracking below to well-below normal in most parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  However, precipitation in the United States portions of the Red and Souris rivers are tracking as much as 150 to 300 per cent of normal accumulation.  

	Frost depth is below normal in most areas.  As moist and frozen soils reduce infiltration of meltwater and increase spring run-off, below-normal frost depth is considered a favourable condition in reducing the extent of spring run-off.

	Base flows and levels in Manitoba rivers have been declining since the fall of 2019, but are still above normal for southern and northern Manitoba, and normal to above normal in central Manitoba basins.

	Manitoba’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre is starting to build its first full Flood Outlook, which will be released in late February.  Forecasters will compile data from several sources including points south and west of Manitoba.  Weather developments from now through April will largely determine the occurrence, extent and severity of spring run-off in 2020.

	Spring run-off in Manitoba rivers is dependent on soil moisture, snow cover, soil frost depth, base flow and levels of rivers, along with the snow melt rate and the amount and timing of the spring rain.  Peak flows on Manitoba rivers are also dependent on the timing of peak flows from the United States and Saskatchewan portions of the basins.

	The Basins Condition Report is available at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/floodinfo/index.html.

PROVINCE RELEASES SECOND 2020 SPRING THAW OUTLOOK


	With the annual spring run-off approaching, the province continues to watch the Red River Valley in anticipation of potential high-water situations, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler said today as he released the second Spring Thaw Outlook of 2020.

	“Our outlook remains similar to the first outlook we released in late February and our focus continues to be on the Red River this spring,” said Schuler.  “Forecasters are expecting a significant inflow of water from the northern United States and they expect high water levels similar to last spring, barring a major early April storm with substantial precipitation or a fast melt.”

	The second Spring Thaw Outlook of 2020 reports the Assiniboine River basin and other rivers are expected to remain mostly in-bank, with possible over-bank high water covering agricultural land at a few locations.

	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre reports with favourable conditions, water levels similar to the spring of 2019 are expected.  Last year, the Red River Floodway was put into service but Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 from Winnipeg south to Emerson remained open.

	Average weather conditions in spring 2020 would result in water levels similar to 2006 on the Red River, according to forecasters.  In that year, PTH 75 was closed for 18 days.  Unfavourable weather could lead to a run-off nearing 2011 levels.  In 2011, PTH 75 was closed for 28 days.

	The minister noted the province has invested nearly $80 million in flood mitigation measures through the Red River Valley over the past four years.  Projects include:
	•    $31 million for raising northbound lanes of PTH 75 south from St. Jean Baptiste to Morris to 2009 flood levels and improving drainage;
	•    $15.5 million for reconstructing the Plum River bridge in the northbound lanes of PTH 75 near St. Jean Baptiste;
	•    $10.3 million for reconstructing the Marsh River bridge on PTH 23 east of Morris;
	•    $4.2 million for reconstructing the Little Morris River bridge on PR 422 near Rosenfeld;  
	•    a $1.3-million project will raise PR 205 in the vicinity of Rosenort and this ongoing project is scheduled for completion in October 2020;
	•    a $1-million project will raise PR 422 in the vicinity of Rosenort, scheduled to be completed in October 2020;
	•    a $8.3-million bridge is under construction over the Aux Marais River on PR 201 with a scheduled completion date of fall 2020;
	•    a $7.8-million concrete culvert replacement project is underway over the Kronsgart Drain on PTH 75 and is expected to be completed by fall 2020; and
	•    a $1-million steel culvert replacement project for the Aubigny Drain on PR 246 is complete and open to traffic.

	The minister noted that considerable provincial resources are involved in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 and officials have contingency plans in place if the approaching spring thaw requires preparations for high water management.  

	The delivery of emergency services continues with appropriate personal protection during this COVID-19 episode and any high water response will be developed with COVID-19 in mind.  Safe work procedures are being finalized to ensure the safety of all response workers and maintain social distancing in producing sandbags and building dikes if required, the minister said.
	 
	“The government has also recently announced the most emergency-ready budget in Manitoba history with additional financial provisions for COVID-19 and any other emergencies we may face,” said Schuler.  “Manitobans have dealt with many emergencies in the past, and we will be prepared for any high-water event that may develop over the coming weeks.”

	The second 2020 Spring Thaw Outlook report will be available at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/floodinfo/index.html.

PROVINCE EASES SPRING ROAD RESTRICTIONS TO AID TRANSPORTATION OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES


	The Manitoba government is easing 2020 Spring Road Restrictions to aid the transportation of essential commodities, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“In order to allow vehicles to more easily transport essential goods during the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are easing spring road restrictions in certain circumstances,” said Schuler.  “This will help ensure communities continue to have access to items such as medical supplies, groceries and emergency equipment at this crucial time.”

	Under normal conditions, spring weight restrictions are enforced on Manitoba’s surfaced roads during the spring.  This protects roads from excessive damage by reducing the axle weights of heavy commercial vehicles during the period when roads are most at risk of weakening under spring rains and thawing.

	Under the revised restrictions, a vehicle may transport essential commodities at normal loading on highways that are subject to Level 1 road restrictions. Additionally, essential commodities may be transported at normal loading on roads subject to Level 2 restrictions, under the following conditions:
	•    If the highway links two points on the vehicle’s itinerary that are less than 10 kilometres apart, or in any other case if the highway is the most direct route between a point on the itinerary and the nearest highway that is not subject to Level 2 road restrictions.  A point on the itinerary means that the vehicle is picking up, or dropping off a load on that Level 2 restricted highway.
	•    If the essential commodities are transported between midnight and noon during the first 14 days of this restriction order, or at any time of the day after the 14th day.

	Vehicles that are travelling empty to pick up essential commodities, or travelling empty after having delivered them, may travel at any time of the day at Level 1 weights on highways that are subject to Level 2 road restrictions, if they comply with the above-noted conditions.

	Essential commodities include groceries, medical supplies, fuel, fertilizer, bulk milk, potable water for non-industrial use, emergency equipment and materials, and mail delivery on behalf of the Canada Post Corporation.  It also includes livestock and livestock feed in transit, and hay for feed in transit within Manitoba.  

	For the 2020 Spring Road Restrictions season, a permit is not required to transport grain to satisfy grain quotas or contracts, or to transport potatoes or vegetables from producer to processor, and these commodities are eligible for the normal loading described above.

	Vehicles are not authorized to travel over a bridge or other structure in excess of posted weight restrictions.

	For complete details on road restrictions, visit www.gov.mb.ca/mit/srr/index.html.

	At the advice of the chief provincial public health officer, Manitoba is suspending classroom learning for kindergarten to Grade 12 students indefinitely for this school year to help ‘flatten the curve’ and reduce the impact of COVID-19 throughout the province, Premier Brian Pallister and Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	“We must do everything we can to flatten the COVID curve and protect the health and well-being of all Manitobans,” said Pallister.  “The decision to suspend classroom learning in school indefinitely for this school year is the easiest decision to make because it protects our children and their education – it is the right thing to do.” 

	The suspension of in-school classes follows the province’s announcement on March 13 that they would be suspended at all kindergarten to Grade 12 schools through April 10.  This new step to extend the suspension is being taken with the interests of students, educators and all Manitobans in mind, the premier noted.

	No student will be held back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but students must actively engage in learning.  All students on track to graduate will do so.  Teachers will teach remotely, assign work, conduct assessments and prepare final report cards.  For students in Grade 12, provincial exams will be cancelled, but teacher assessments will be implemented.  For students in early and middle years, provincial assessments are complete for the current school year, but other assessments will continue.

	“The efforts and success Manitoba teachers and educators have displayed during this public health pandemic have been inspiring,” said Goertzen.  “I join all Manitobans in asking educators to continue doing all they can to use remote and innovative methods to teach students through the remainder of this school year.  Our government is asking for an all-hands-on-deck approach, with their assistance and with that of parents, caregivers, principals, trustees and superintendents for the benefit of all students.”

	Child-care centres located in schools will continue to operate under the current conditions set out by the chief provincial public health officer.  The overall plan is oriented toward the future and we will learn how to modernize education through our response to this situation, Goertzen said.  The combined efforts are geared toward the reopening of classrooms, as well as toward multifaceted ways to teach and to learn after COVID-19, he added.

	The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols, including practising the 3Ps – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

MANITOBA SUPPORTS PROGRAMS FOR AT-RISK YOUTH IN ALTONA
					  Funding will Help Purchase Vehicle for Youth Organization:  Cullen


	The Manitoba government is investing $25,000 to help purchase a new vehicle to support the programs and outreach efforts of Youth for Christ (YFC) Altona, a local organization that works with at-risk youth and their families, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“Many vulnerable and at-risk young people can thrive if given the opportunity to access community-based programs and supports,” said Cullen.  “Our investment will help ensure these young Manitobans will benefit from positive experiences that can help put them on a healthier, more productive path for the rest of their lives.  This approach is one way that our government is building safer communities for us all.”

	Funding will be provided to replace an aging van that is no longer cost-effective to maintain or repair.  The vehicle is expected to be delivered later this spring and will be used to transport young people to hundreds of educational, recreational and employment-related experiences annually.

	“This van is essential in enabling us to reach at-risk youth in our community,” said Sheridan Sawatzky, executive director, YFC Altona.  “It will provide a safe and reliable means of transportation.  More than that, it will ensure that economic and social barriers don’t stand in the way of every young person reaching their full potential.  Offering better opportunities to every young person is essential to the overall health of our community.  We are incredibly blessed and thankful for all the support this project has received.”

	YFC Altona has been active in the community since 1999 and its drop-in centre serves young adults aged 12 to 28.  The application for funding was submitted by Altona Police Service on their behalf, recognizing the positive effect their work can have on community safety.

	“Our youth are our future,” said Chief Perry Batchelor, Altona Police Service.  “It is outstanding that we have an organization in our community where so many people volunteer their time, ensuring that these kids have an opportunity to participate in so many positive events.  The new van will get them there and back safely.”

	This provincial investment is provided through the federal Proceeds of Crime Fund, which is made up of forfeited funds provided to Manitoba from federally prosecuted Criminal Code offences.  The province has also distributed approximately $1.6 million to law enforcement agencies across Manitoba from its Criminal Property Forfeiture Fund this year.  These funds have been used to:
	•    purchase specialized equipment and training for police agencies to improve officer and community safety,
	•    support victims of crime, and  
	•    invest in community organizations leading public safety and crime prevention initiatives.

PROVINCE TO ALLOW SALE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES FOR TAKE OUT AND DELIVERY SERVICE


	The Manitoba government will authorize the sale of liquor with take out and delivery meal service by licensed establishments, Crown Services Minister Jeff Wharton announced today.
	 
	“We have heard from restaurant owners who have expressed a strong interest in selling wine, beer and single-serve beverages through food take out or delivery service, and had already started the process of bringing in necessary changes,” said Wharton.  “These businesses have been significantly impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 and by allowing this flexibility now, restaurants will be able to offer an additional service to customers when it is needed most.”

	The Manitoba government has issued a new public health order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 that prohibits all restaurants and other commercial facilities from serving food to customers in their premises.  However, restaurants and other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or takeout.  

	Enabling licensed establishments to sell liquor with take out and delivery will provide greater opportunities and flexibility for businesses significantly impacted by COVID-19, and more choice and convenience for consumers coping with the pandemic at home, the minister said.

	Liquor delivery and take out orders would be linked to meal orders and offered by licensed establishments whose primary business is food, such as restaurants.  Liquor pricing will be the same as in-dining service menu prices, which will link wine and beer retail to the licensees’ meal service.

Background Information

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is issuing a new public health order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of all Manitobans, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“These decisions are not easy ones, but they must be made during this global pandemic to protect the health and safety of all Manitobans,” said Pallister.  “These new orders will ensure critical services are available while taking steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.”

	The chief provincial public health officer is issuing orders under The Public Health Act as approved by the minister of health, seniors and active living.  The following measures will be in place as of 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, April 1:
	•    Public gatherings are limited to no more than 10 people at any indoor or outdoor place or premises.  This includes places of worship, gatherings and family events such as weddings and funerals.  This does not apply to a facility where health care or social services are provided including child-care centres and homeless shelters.  This remains in effect at this time under the previous health order issued on March 27, and will continue when this order comes into effect on April 1.
	•    All restaurants and other commercial facilities that serve food are prohibited from serving food to customers in their premises.  This prevents eat-in dining at all facilities.  However, restaurants and other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or takeout.  If this takes place, the operator of the restaurant must ensure that all people maintain the appropriate social distancing from other customers when picking up food.
	•    All businesses that are not listed in the schedule of critical services that accompanies the order must close between April 1 and April 14.
	    - This closure order does not prevent these businesses from operating on a remote basis.
	    - A business may accept orders on the Internet, or over the phone for delivery or pickup, as long as the employees are not working at the place of business.
	    - The order does not prevent employees or others from coming into the business to perform repairs, to provide security services or to take out items from the business premises if the business is going to operate on a remote basis.
	    - Nothing in the order restricts the operations of delivery of services by the federal or provincial governments or a municipality.
	    - Nothing in the order restricts any activities of a publicly funded agency, organization or authority that delivers or supports government operations or services including health-care services.  This means the order does not affect institutions, agencies and other service providers who provide health-care services such as hospitals, regional health authorities and private agencies who provide a range of health services.
	•    All businesses listed in the schedule of critical services that accompanies the order may continue to operate.  If these business allow members of the public to attend the place of business, the operator of the business must put in place measures to ensure that appropriate social distancing rules are followed.
	•    The order does not affect how members of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba, the College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba, the College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Manitoba or the College of Midwives of Manitoba provide health-care services under the order.  Any other health professionals may continue to practice if they are providing services for a publicly funded agency, such as a government or a regional health authority, or a business listed under the schedule.  In addition, health-care providers can continue to provide emergent or urgent care such as dental surgery.  
	•    Municipal transit services, taxis and other private vehicles for hire can continue to operate.  The operator of the vehicle must take measures to ensure there is a reasonable separation of people in a vehicle.  This order does not contain specific distance restrictions because it is hard to impose a limit in small vehicles.  The goal is to ensure a reasonable level of spacing between people.

	The order also repeals previous orders as of 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, April 1 so there is only one public health order in effect at a time.

	“We are seeing what is happening in other jurisdictions, and the time to act is now.  We must continue to adapt to the situation and change our day-to-day lives to prevent unnecessary illness and further tragedies in Manitoba,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer.  “These measures will help us reduce the risk and protect all Manitobans during the ongoing pandemic.”

	The premier noted that a state of emergency declared by the powers set out in Section 10(1) and 10(2) of The Emergency Measures Act to enable the province to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic remains in effect.

	“Manitobans have always pulled together in a time of crisis and this is no different,” said Pallister.  “We must continue to do whatever we can to support each other.”

	The list of public health orders and the schedule of critical services can be found online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19/soe.html.  Businesses with questions about how the order and schedule of critical services apply to their operations can visit http://engagemb.ca/covid19-csp for up-to-date information, and to ask questions that will be answered by government officials.

	A community testing site will open Monday, March 30 in Pine Falls at École Powerview School, 33 Vincent St., from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday to Friday.  This brings the total to 15 community testing sites including six drive-thru locations.  The public is reminded that a referral to these sites is needed and they are not walk-in clinics.  Information on locations and hours of operation are available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

	Moving forward, the province will continue to share updates on the total number of cases but additional patient information such as gender, age and the regional health authority where they reside will be provided online once it is confirmed through public health investigation.  The province is also working to provide an additional breakdown of information online, including the number of hospitalizations, home recovery, and cases that are resolved.  This reporting is in line with reporting in other jurisdictions and ensures consistent, accurate data is available to the public.

	Information about flights where a person with a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 had symptoms at the time of travel is updated at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/flights.html as information becomes available.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES TEMPORARY EXCEPTION TO EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS LAYOFF RULES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  More Flexibility Would Benefit Employers and Employees:  Fielding


	The Manitoba government is adding a temporary exception to employment standards regulations to give employers more time to recall employees laid off as a result of COVID-19, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.
	 
	“The sudden economic impacts of COVID-19 are significant and we are addressing concerns we’ve heard from both employers and the labour force in Manitoba as businesses are forced to close their doors and lay off employees,” said Fielding.  “This measure will provide flexibility to employers to recall employees once work picks up again after this difficult time period and avoid severing their employment.”

	Under current employment standards legislation, employees who have been laid off for eight or more weeks in a 16-week period are deemed to have been terminated and are entitled to wages in lieu of notice.

	After consulting and receiving the support of the Labour Management Review Committee, which includes representatives of both employers and labour organizations, the province is making temporary amendments that would ensure any period of layoff occurring after March 1, 2020, will not be counted toward the period after which a temporary layoff would become a permanent termination.

	“We recognize these unique circumstances may require a longer layoff period than regulation allows, so these amendments would stop the clock until the state of emergency is lifted and keep employers in a position to quickly recall laid-off employees and ramp up business again,” said Fielding.  “We are committed to supporting Manitobans through the COVID-19 pandemic, and we’re taking a balanced approach to help both employers and employees to address economic uncertainty and financial hardship.”

	This measure is temporary and specific to situations where employees will eventually be rehired once the COVID-19 crisis has subsided and economic activity picks up again, said the minister.

	The minister noted the province will also take steps to support workers and will suspend the exception when the province begins to recover economically.  Workers who are temporarily laid off may also have options to access streamlined federal employment benefits at this time.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government will establish five highway checkpoints and provide information in airports to help inform travellers about the public health measures in place to slow the spread of COVID-19, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen and Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“We must do everything we can to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities and on our health-care system,” said Cullen.  “This approach will help ensure travellers know they must self-isolate, what the province’s state of emergency means to them and other important public health information.  By being informed, we can reduce the risk to Manitobans and help keep our communities healthy and safe.”

	Travellers will receive information about Manitoba’s current state of emergency, public health orders issued under The Public Health Act, and the need to immediately self-isolate for 14 days after travel in Canada or internationally.  If Manitobans need assistance with groceries, prescription pickup and other services, they are encouraged to go to www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca.

	Cullen noted this kind of proactive measure to inform travellers and help slow the spread of COVID-19 is critical. 

	Checkpoints will be located at the:
	•    Ontario border:
	      - Trans-Canada Highway East (West Hawk Lake/Falcon Lake);
	•    Saskatchewan border:
	     - Trans-Canada Highway West (west of Kirkella/Elkhorn/Virden);
	     -  PTH 16 (west of Russell);
	     -  PTH 5W (west of Roblin); and
	     -  PTH 2 (west of Sinclair/Reston/Souris).

	“We expect these checkpoints to be operational this week, staffed by provincial employees,” said Schuler.  “Drivers can expect to see roadside signage to help direct them to the checkpoints and support traffic safety.”

	These checkpoints are established under the authority of The Public Health Act.  No one will be denied entry into Manitoba at these locations.

	Signage will also be placed at the Winnipeg Richardson International Airport and the Brandon Municipal Airport to ensure people arriving on domestic flights have similar information.

	The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols including practising following the 3P’s – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Effective March 23, public health officials recommended anyone who returns from international or domestic travel should self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days following their return. This recommendation does not include:
	•    the commercial transportation of goods;
	•    workers who live in a neighbouring jurisdiction and travel to Manitoba for work;
	•    health care workers who travel to work from outside the province; and
	•    normal personal travel in border communities including visits to a cottage.

	The Manitoba government is investing in the mental health of Manitobans by introducing a program to help address anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Pandemics bring about a high level of stress and anxiety, and the health and well-being of Manitobans continues to be our priority during this uncertain time,” said Pallister.  “Many of us are feeling concerns over whether we will get sick, the health of our families, the security of our jobs, being isolated from our loved ones and many other variables.  As part of our emergency response to COVID-19, we are introducing an easily accessible virtual option to help support Manitobans.”

	To help Manitobans experiencing mild to moderate anxiety due to COVID-19, the province is partnering with Morneau Shepell, Canada’s leading provider of technology-enabled HR services, to launch an internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) program free of charge to all Manitobans 16 years old and over.  The province will spend $4.5 million to provide these services to Manitobans for up to a year.

	Morneau Shepell launched this digital therapy program last week in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. T he new program is guided by professional therapists and addresses anxiety symptoms related to the uniquely challenging aspects of pandemics: uncertainty, physical isolation, caring for family and community members, information overload and stress management.

	“We know many Canadians are struggling with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health,” said Nigel Branker, president, health and productivity solutions at Morneau Shepell.  “With the requirements to self-isolate and practice physical distancing, we are offering a convenient, digital program that can be accessed with any smartphone or tablet.  Our goal is to facilitate access and provide support to as many people as possible across the country.""

	Morneau Shepell’s national network includes thousands of therapists experienced in dealing with the psychological impact of various traumatic events.  Program participants also have access to live crisis counsellors who are available 24-7 if any risk of harm or crisis is identified.

	The program will be available in English and French in the coming weeks at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Pallister noted this is an additional resource to supplement a number of mental health organizations funded by the Manitoba government.  Existing organizations that provide crisis support via phone, text and video conference will continue to provide support through the pandemic.  

	Lists of organizations are available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/crisis.html  and www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/addictions/index.html.

MANITOBA ANNOUNCES MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN FLOOD PROTECTION WHILE MODERNIZING PROVINCIAL DISASTER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
					  Flood Protection Program Supports Municipalities in Building Future Flood Resiliency:  Squires


	The province will invest nearly $8 million to support more than 80 Manitoba municipalities with enhancing spring flood preparations and protection, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires and Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“Manitobans always rally together in challenging times and while we are facing unprecedented global circumstances, our government is helping municipalities take important steps to enhance flood protection,"" Squires said.  “Municipalities know best what will work for them, and this program is designed to help ensure protection put in place this year will benefit communities for many years to come.”

	Under the 2020 Flood Protection Program, the province offered one-time funding support to municipalities in enhancing municipal capacity for flood preparedness, equipment costs and build resiliency for future floods.  Initially, the one-time program was capped at $3 million, but in light of the need for preparation this spring, the funding will more than double for projects in areas all across Manitoba, the minister said.

	This funding will bring added resources for projects and equipment for the crews who will be working on flood protection in areas all across Manitoba, while boosting economic activity during extraordinary global challenges, the minister noted.

	Proposals were reviewed by a panel made up of representatives from the Association of Manitoba Municipalities (AMM), Winnipeg Metropolitan Region and the Manitoba government.  Evaluation of proposals considered factors including flood risk, ability of the proposal to enhance emergency preparedness or resiliency for future flood events, as well as potential regional benefits.

	Based on applications, the breakdown for funding by district is:
	•    Central District – $1,271,662.07 for 14 municipalities;
	•    Eastern District – $776,451.01 for 10 municipalities;
	•    Interlake District – $1,059.167.70 for 10 municipalities;
	•    Midwestern District – $715,082.41 for nine municipalities;
	•    Northern District – $76,899.00 for two municipalities;
	•    Parkland District –  $759,262.68 for 11 municipalities;
	•    Western District – $1,139,583.73 for 15 municipalities; and
	•    Winnipeg Metropolitan Region – $2,041,770.52 for 13 municipalities.

	“The Association of Manitoba Municipalities commends the provincial government for more than doubling its initial commitment to support the Spring Flood Preparedness program,” said Ralph Groening, president of the AMM.  “As municipalities cannot fight floods alone, these additional dollars further help underscore the importance of the provincial-municipal partnership.”

	“The Winnipeg Metropolitan Region commends the Province of Manitoba for providing support through the 2020 Flood Protection Program in such a timely and direct way, as municipalities are on the front lines in flood fighting across this province.  With an important focus on partnerships and projects that cross jurisdictions, this program will ensure resources are used for the maximum benefit of all Manitobans,"" Colleen Sklar, executive director, Winnipeg Metropolitan Region.

	The funding covers a range of items including generators, pumps, steaming equipment to unclog frozen culverts, utility trailers, equipment for emergency operations centres, sandbags and other small equipment that will assist municipalities in protecting vital infrastructure and reducing flood damage.  These items reflect what municipalities have identified as their priority needs in order to prepare for future flood events.

	Also announced today was a new opportunity for municipalities to set aside funding for disaster mitigation programs in their communities while modernizing the Disaster Financial Assistance (DFA) cost-sharing formula.

	“We have developed an optional program for municipalities to apply to set aside funds dedicated to disaster mitigation and increase the resilience of Manitobans against future disasters,” said Squires.  “If approved, municipalities would be able to redirect funds destined for payments under the provincial/municipal DFA cost-sharing formula to disaster mitigation and preparedness measures.”

	“The existing DFA system is a decade old and needs to be revised,” said Schuler.  “As the scale and scope of disasters increases, governments need to shift their focus to mitigation in order to limit the impact of future disasters, rather than relying on response and recovery.”

	If approved, municipalities would be able to redirect funds destined for payments under the provincial/municipal DFA cost-sharing formula to disaster mitigation and preparedness measures.  This would apply when a DFA program qualifies for federal cost sharing under Canada’s Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA).  In this case, the province would reimburse municipalities for 100 per cent of eligible DFA costs.

	Proposed changes to the Disaster Financial Assistance program will result in municipalities covering the first $3.25 per capita, up from $1 per capita, before the DFA formula applies.

	Further details are available at www.manitobaemo.ca.

PROVINCE CALLS ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR MORE HEALTH-CARE SUPPORT AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  Stronger Banks or Stronger Health Care, the Choice is Clear:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is calling on the federal government to better support health care by lowering borrowing costs, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Manitobans and Canadians are facing a historic pandemic that poses significant public health and economic challenges”, Pallister said. “This is a time to unite, this is a chance for the federal government to help Manitoba and all other provinces obtain the investments needed to secure our public health-care services for all Canadians.”

	All provinces will face significant fiscal challenges in the coming months as revenues decrease and expenses increase.  Most provinces spend nearly half their provincial budgets on health care, and every province needs the liquidity to keep paying their bills, while ensuring the sustainability of services today and well into the future, the premier added.

	“Under the previous government, Manitoba became the most debt ridden province in the country,” Pallister said.  “Over the last four years our government made significant progress to restore the ‘rainy day’ fund to nearly $1 billion for times of emergency, like these. Should the current situation deteriorate further and faster than expected, additional funds will have to be borrowed to shore up our health care system.”

	To address this urgent need, the federal government should immediately establish an emergency credit agency to borrow on the provinces’ behalf. The premier noted the federal government can borrow at a much lower rate than the provinces. This would save Canadians billions of dollars annually that could be better spent supporting health-care and the most vulnerable Canadians.

	“Together, we are facing tremendous challenges,” said Pallister. “Now more than ever, Manitobans deserve a health-care system they can be confident in. The choice is clear, stronger banks, or stronger health care.”

PROVINCE APPEALS TO MANITOBA BUSINESSES TO FIND CREATIVE SUPPLY SOLUTIONS TO HELP CONTAIN COVID-19
					  Engaging Manitoba Industry to Bolster Province's Long-Term Supply:  Friesen

Watch news conference





	The province is reaching out to businesses and their employees for products and supplies to help efforts in the fight against COVID-19, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“The Manitoba government is working to contain and reduce the impact of COVID-19, and we’re taking measures to bolster the health system with help from the private sector,” said Friesen.  “We are soliciting for help to collect the supplies we need in order to guard Manitobans against COVID-19.”

	The minister noted as part of the ongoing battle against COVID-19, the province has, to date, invested emergency spending of almost $64 million in critical goods and services including personal protective equipment, ventilators, intravenous pumps and chest compression systems.

	He also introduced an online portal asking businesses to assist with supplying products and manufacturing what Manitobans need in Manitoba.

	“To help us further our efforts, our government is reaching out to businesses and their employees for products and supplies and those willing to manufacture items from scratch to assist in our efforts in this fight against COVID-19,” Friesen said.  “We recognize that dealing with this pandemic will be a marathon, not a sprint.  Support from Manitoba businesses with additional materials will ensure front-line staff have the equipment they need to protect themselves while continuing to provide exemplary care to patients throughout the province.”

	This initiative will remove barriers allowing Manitoba businesses and manufacturers to redeploy capacity towards the production of essential equipment like ventilators, masks and nasopharyngeal swabs. 

	The province has also intensified the search for 10 chest compression systems, which provide additional safety as the equipment removes one staff member from the room. The equipment will be allocated across the province.

	Products businesses can supply include:
	•    N95 respirators,
	•    surgical/procedure masks,
	•    nitrile gloves,
	•    vinyl gloves,
	•    nasopharyngeal swabs,
	•    specific types of reagent to be used in labs,
	•    gowns,
	•    hand sanitizer,
	•    cleaning supplies, and
	•    disinfecting supplies.

	Services Manitobans can provide include:
	•    guard/security services,
	•    nursing services,
	•    food services,
	•    laundry services,
	•    accommodation maintenance services,
	•    personal services,
	•    IT support services,
	•    pet care services,
	•    transportation services, and
	•    consulting services.

	“We are ahead of the curve and the goal remains to flatten it.  Manitobans are coming together to help each other and it’s time for business to step up,” said Friesen.  “We continue to remind Manitobans of these simple but critical and effective steps:  wash your hands, keep your distance and stay home.”

	The minister noted that in addition to today’s business-focused website, the province created a new web application www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca to help those in need of assistance, postponed non-urgent eviction hearings, and will freeze rent increases.

	“Manitoba’s health-care system worked hard to prepare for COVID-19 and we are well-stocked with the items we need to keep Manitobans safe,” said Friesen.  “However, we recognize that our supply chain may be impacted going forward in this challenging time.  Manitobans have many skill sets and resources, and we’re encouraging you to help out our fellow Manitobans by proactively asking local vendors to consider producing or contributing supplies and services.”

	Public health officials advise that case numbers and the total number of cases are different because one case was retested and was found to be negative.

	Also note that a probable case previously reported on March 23 of a man in his 50s who lives in Winnipeg with a history of travel should be referenced as case 21.  In addition, a probable case previously reported on March 24 of a man in his 40s who lives in Winnipeg with a travel history under investigation should be referenced as case 22.

	Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential travel.  This includes international travel and travel within Canada.  There should be no recreational, tourist or non-essential personal travel.  In addition, public health officials recommended that effective March 23, anyone who returns from international or domestic travel should self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days following their return.

	This recommendation does not include:
	•    the commercial transportation of goods and services;
	•    workers who live in a neighbouring jurisdiction and travel to Manitoba for work;
	•    health care workers who travel to work from outside the province;
	•    normal personal travel in border communities, including visits to a cottage.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

	In recognition of the current challenges, the province will defer any increases to the Manitoba Pharmacare deductible that were scheduled to take effect April 1.  The deductible will still come into effect on April 1, but will remain at 2019-20 levels throughout 2020-21 to assist Manitobans with supply limits imposed on pharmacies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  

	Manitobans are reminded that pharmacies have been asked to limit individuals to a 30-day supply of medication.  All Canadian provinces have taken this step to prevent hoarding and ensure there is a consistent supply of medications.

	A new community testing drive-thru site officially opened today in Winkler, at the Winkler Centennial Arena at 600 Park St.  Hours are daily from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.  There are now 12 community testing sites including four drive-thru locations.  The public is reminded that a referral to these sites is needed and they are not walk-in clinics. Information on locations and hours of operation are available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

MANITOBA TO POSTPONE EVICTION HEARINGS AND FREEZE RENT INCREASES
					  Balanced Approach Protects Manitobans While Ensuring Landlord and Tenant Health and Safety:  Premier

Watch news conference





	As part of the province’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and state of emergency, the Manitoba government will postpone eviction hearings and freeze rent increases, Premier Brian Pallister and Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.
	 
	“Taking these steps will help reduce financial uncertainty and worry for Manitobans who face challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Pallister.  “Manitobans who have been laid off, are working less or are in self isolation shouldn’t also have to worry about making rent payments and keeping a roof over their heads.”

	The province will suspend any rent increases scheduled to take effect on April 1 or later.

	The Residential Tenancies Branch (RTB) and Residential Tenancies Commission (RTC) will postpone all hearings for non-urgent matters to halt evictions.

	Effective today, all scheduled RTB and RTC hearings will be delayed to protect Manitobans from evictions during the pandemic, with certain exceptions to deal with urgent issues that involve the health and safety of tenants.

	The RTB and the RTC will only issue eviction orders to address issues affecting health and safety including unlawful activities.

	Measures to suspend non-urgent eviction hearings are in place until May 31 and will be monitored to determine if additional adjustments are required.

	“This approach balances the need to support renters experiencing economic hardship or who are self-isolating in their unit due to COVID-19 with those safety concerns,” said Fielding.  “The Residential Tenancies Branch remains available to resolve urgent situations involving health and safety for landlords and tenants, which could include a landlord illegally shutting off utilities or locking tenants out of their rental unit, or a landlord dealing with a situation where a tenant is conducting illegal activities from their rental unit.”

	The RTB offices in Winnipeg and Brandon remain open but all clients must make an appointment first.  The Thompson office is temporarily closed.  Landlords and tenants are encouraged to contact the RTB for information by telephone at 204-945-2476 or toll-free at 1-800-782-8403 and by email at rtb@gov.mb.ca If you are a landlord or tenant and require in-person services, contact the RTB to schedule an appointment.
	 
	The RTC remains open, with appropriate social distancing measures in place. The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols, including practising following the 3P’s – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.

	The public is reminded that visitor access at hospitals has been suspended.  Exceptions for compassionate and end-of-life reasons will continue to be made on a case-by-case basis and visitors will be appropriately screened for travel, symptoms and exposure to COVID-19.  For labour and delivery as well as pediatric patients, one visitor continues to be allowed, with the same stringent screening in place.

	Visitor access at long-term care facilities is also subject to significant restrictions, which will now include screening for visitors who have returned from travel outside the province in the last 14 days.  These measures are in place to protect patients, residents and staff.
	 
	Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential travel.  This includes international travel and travel within Canada.  There should be no recreational, tourist or non-essential personal travel.  In addition, effective immediately, public health officials are recommending that anyone who returns from travel, either international or domestic, should self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days following their return.

	If symptoms develop during the 14-day self-isolation or self-monitoring period, contact Health Links– Info Santé to determine if testing for COVID-19 should be considered.  In cases where testing is not recommended but symptoms are present, stay home (self-isolate) until well.

	Health officials are reminding health-care workers (including physicians, providers and staff) returning from travel they MUST self-identify to their organization/site’s occupational health services.  Health-care workers from organizations that do not have Occupational Health Services can call (toll-free) 1-888-203-4066.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

PROVINCE LAUNCHES ONLINE TOOL TO CONNECT VOLUNTEERS SAFELY WITH MANITOBANS NEEDING ASSISTANCE
					  Made-in-Manitoba Website Application Demonstrates Teamwork, Technological Innovation, Community Spirit:  Premier

Watch news conference





	The generosity and innovation of Manitobans to help those in need of assistance is displayed in the new web application www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca, Premier Brian Pallister announced today immediately after the online tool went live.

	“This new online tool captures the spirit of our province, where Manitobans in communities across our province can always be counted on to step up to assist others who need help, especially in times of need,” said Pallister.  “The innovative tool, created by Manitobans for Manitobans, puts people all over the province who need assistance easily in contact with those nearby – while adhering to social distancing protocols – who want to help them.”

	The premier said www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca is an important initiative for the Manitoba government, safely matching volunteer and community support to needs for goods and services such as groceries, medication, snow-clearing and various other necessities. Residents in greatest need, such as the elderly, disabled and those at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during the current global pandemic, will find the application very useful, he noted.

	Built by Manitobans for Manitobans, the provincewide online platform was quickly designed and developed by North Forge Technology Exchange, a non-profit and team-led Winnipeg technology organization, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  North Forge collaborated with others in the community, resulting in development of the app – the first online service of its kind in Canada – within five days.

	“There are a lot of amazing people out there creating volunteer platforms, but we wanted to ensure that security and safety are embedded to protect our citizens”, Joelle Foster, CEO, North Forge Technology Exchange. “As such, we turned to our community of innovators and we are so pleased that software development partners like Permission Click and ID Fusion Software stepped up to collaborate with us and have built this tool in record time.""

	The online tool www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca will be vital for requests ranging from home computer and data security assistance to prescription medication pickups and deliveries.  Manitobans can access www.HelpNextDoorMB.ca directly or via www.Manitoba.ca/COVID19.

	“This is how Manitobans pull together, put their heads together and bring ideas to life to assist each other when help is needed,” said Pallister.  “Manitoba has been the home of hope for over 150 years, and we will continue to be the home of hope for generations to come.  We will get through this pandemic together.

	The premier added the province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols, including practising following the 3P’s – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.

	Public health officials advise an additional probable case of COVID-19 has been identified, while another case initially identified as probable has been ruled out.  That case will be removed from the list, meaning the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba remains at 20.

	The newest probable positive case is a man in his 50s who lives in Winnipeg.  At this time, the public health investigation indicates the case is related to travel.  Information about flights where a person with a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 had symptoms at the time of travel are updated as information becomes available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/flights.html.

	This recommendation does not include:
	•    the commercial transportation of goods and services;
	•    workers, including health-care workers who live in a neighbouring jurisdiction and travel to Manitoba for work; or
	•    normal personal travel in border communities including visits to a cottage.

	If symptoms develop during the 14-day self-isolation or self-monitoring period, contact Health Links– Info Santé to determine if testing for COVID-19 should be considered.  In cases where testing is not recommended but symptoms are present, stay home (self-isolate) until well.

	Health officials are reminding physicians, health-care providers and support staff returning from travel they MUST self-identify to their organization/site’s occupational health services.

	Research Manitoba is working with the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) to invest in the Canadian 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Rapid Research Funding Opportunity.  The Manitoba government is investing $800,000 and the CIHR is investing more than $465,000 in three research projects including:
	•    investigating how logistical systems can adapt to a pandemic at the University of Manitoba;
	•    developing a cost-effective, point-of-need diagnostic test for COVID-19 at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health; and
	•    developing a COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Manitoba.

	In an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and keep in-home health-care providers and our communities safe, new screening steps will be undertaken in advance of home and community visits.  Health-care providers are contacting clients to complete screening in advance of normal appointments.  Wherever possible, this screening will occur over the phone but may also be conducted from an appropriate social distance (two metres or six feet) before entry to the home.  Screening is intended to identify potential for exposure to COVID-19 within the household, and identify whether services may safely be postponed or offered in another way such as over the phone.

	For visits that must occur in person as scheduled, providers will use appropriate personal protective equipment and follow proper hand hygiene protocols.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

	Eleven community testing sites throughout the province are open.  The public is reminded that a referral to these sites is needed and they are not walk-in clinics.  Information on locations and hours of operation are available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT EXTENDS TAX PAYMENT FILING DEADLINES FOR BUSINESSES
					  Extension Could Help More Than 20,000 Manitoba Businesses Cope with Impacts of COVID-19:  Pallister


	The province is extending tax filing deadlines for businesses impacted by COVID-19, Premier Brian Pallister and Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	 

	“Manitoba businesses are facing a challenging economic situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and we want to help them out by giving them more time to submit provincial taxes,” said Pallister.  “Some businesses may need access to these extra funds and we want to provide them with that flexibility.  The allowance is one of several measures our government has introduced to help Manitobans cope during this trying and uncertain time.”

	 

	The province will extend the April and May filing deadlines for small and medium-sized businesses with monthly remittances of no more than $10,000.  It is estimated this could help more than 20,000 businesses in Manitoba, the premier noted.  Businesses will have up to two additional months to remit retail sales taxes and the Health and Post Secondary Education Tax Levy, commonly called the payroll tax.

	 

	“This extension gives small and medium businesses a two month breather to deal with COVID-19,” said Fielding.  “This global pandemic is impacting all Manitobans and while we focus our resources and energy on the health of Manitobans, we must be mindful of the financial toll the pandemic is having on businesses and families.  Over 95 per cent of Manitoba business are small or medium sized, and they need government support through this difficult time.”

	 

	The minister noted the department will work with businesses regarding flexible repayment options above the $10,000 cap.

	 

	Further information regarding filing requirements will be available Monday on the Manitoba Tax Publications page on the Finance Taxation website at www.gov.mb.ca/finance/taxation/bulletins.html.

	Public health officials advise an additional case of COVID-19 was identified on March 19, bringing the number of lab-confirmed positive and presumptive positive cases in Manitoba to 18 at this time.

	Case 18 is a woman in her 50s who lives in Winnipeg.  At this time, the public health investigation indicates the case is related to travel.  Information about flights where a person with a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 had symptoms at the time of travel are updated at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/flights.html as information becomes available.

	Manitobans are reminded that public health orders remain in effect.  They include:
	•    limit public gatherings to less than 50 people including places of worship, family events, weddings and funerals;
	•    require retailers to ensure separation of two metres between patrons in their facility;
	•    limit hospitality premises such as restaurants or theatres to 50 people, or 50 per cent of capacity (whichever is less); and
	•    immediate closure of bingo and gaming centres, as well as wellness centres such as gyms and fitness centres.

	At this time, the public health orders apply to public places, not workplaces.  However, workplaces should still follow good social distancing practices as recommended by public health including:
	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two meters/six feet) contact between other individuals in public;
	•    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;
	•    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;
	•    staying home if you are sick;
	•    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill with the virus; and

MANITOBA IMPLEMENTING $27.6-MILLION PLAN TO SUPPORT CHILD CARE FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS


	The Manitoba government is investing $27.6 million to help provide child care to essential front-line workers who need it as they support the province’s COVID-19 response, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“This pandemic requires all Manitobans to change how they live their daily lives, but it is clear that we are all willing to work together to find solutions,” said Stefanson.  “Our government is following through on our commitment to parents who must provide essential front-line health and other services and who need help securing child care.  In this time of uncertainty and challenge, we are working in partnership with child-care providers to find creative solutions in the community.”

	To ensure dedicated child-care spaces are available and prioritized for health-care and other essential front-line workers while also following public health recommendations for social distancing, the Manitoba government will:
	•    establish a new $18-million grant program to help early childhood educators affected by the suspension of child-care services in centres to have access to immediate funds to begin independently offering child-care services at their homes or in the community;
	•    continue to provide licensed child-care centres with their full operating grants and subsidies, totaling up to $7.6 million provincewide, so that they can provide care for up to 16 children with first priority given to children of health-care and other essential workers;
	•    invest $2 million to create a trust that will provide capital grants to child-care providers to ensure safe, quality care; and
	•    encourage all centres to reimburse prepaid fees to parents for child care they can no longer access during this difficult time.

	“Manitoba’s child-care providers have clearly demonstrated their dedication, caring and willingness to work together as we respond to an unprecedented situation,” said Stefanson.  “Our government is taking concrete, immediate steps to help ensure child-care options continue to be available when they are needed most.”

	The province is partnering with the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce and the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce to administer the $18-million grant program.  Further details, including on how to apply, will be available online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.  Eligible early childhood educators would each receive up to $3,000 to provide care to children at their homes or at other appropriate spaces.  Early childhood educators would also be able to individually apply for the grants and to choose to work together to provide care in the community for up to a maximum of 12 children.

	The $2-million fund will be administered by The Winnipeg Foundation and will provide grants to child-care providers with 16 or fewer children and to home-based providers with 12 or fewer children.  The grants can be used to purchase supplies for meeting health and safety requirements, such as a fire extinguisher or first aid kits, or to undertake minor upgrades to physical spaces or to provide quality learning and care items such as high chairs, mats or books.

	Further information on all of these programs will be provided online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.
	 
	The Manitoba government recommends that all parents continue to try to make their own alternate arrangements for child care.  These interim options should be used only when parents cannot make other child-care plans.  Parents who use these options will continue to pay daily parent fees.

	Child-care centres are expected to reimburse or offer credits on parent fees that have been collected for dates when care will no longer be offered.  Unless care is being provided, parent fees should no longer be charged as of April 1.

	Essential, front-line workers who need child-care options should call 204-945-0776 or (toll-free) 1-888-213-4754, or e-mail cdcinfo@gov.mb.ca.  All questions about the new funding programs available to child-care centres and early childhood educators should be sent to ecegrant@gov.mb.ca.

	Manitobans are reminded to visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19 for more information on COVID-19 and for updates on the province’s response.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC, REDUCE SPREAD OF COVID-19
					  Focus Solely on Health and Safety of all Manitobans:  Premier


	The Manitoba government is declaring a provincewide state of emergency under The Emergency Measures Act to protect the health and safety of all Manitobans and reduce the spread of COVID-19, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“This decision was not made lightly.  However, we must continue to use every tool available to ‘flatten the curve’ and reduce the spread of COVID-19 on our communities and our health-care system,” said Pallister.  “Our government is focused solely on the health and safety of all Manitobans.  This move will enable us to react more quickly on a broad range of supportive measures to stop the spread for COVID-19 and ensure that essential services are available for all Manitobans during this global health pandemic.”

	A state of emergency has been declared by the powers set out in Section 10(1) and 10(2) of The Emergency Measures Act to enable the province to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, the chief provincial public health officer is issuing orders under The Public Health Act as approved by the minister of health, seniors and active living.

	“With this declaration, the biggest roles for all Manitobans to play right now, is to protect yourself, your family, your friends and your community,"" said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer.  “I cannot emphasize this enough – this is the time for action.  We must change our day-to-day lives, and think about your role in protecting ourselves and all Manitobans.”

	As authorized under The Public Health Act, the following measures will be in place, effective immediately, for a period of 30 days:
	1.    Limiting public gatherings of more than 50 people at any indoor or outdoor place or premises.  This includes places of worship, gatherings and family events such as weddings and funerals.  This does not apply to a facility where health care or social services are provided.  Retail businesses including grocery or food stores, shopping centres, pharmacies or gas stations must ensure separation of one to two metres between patrons assembling in the business.  Public transportation facilities must also ensure that people assembling at the facility are reasonably able to maintain a separation of one to two metres from others assembling at the facility.
	2.    Limiting hospitality premises where food or alcohol is served or any theatres offering live performances of music, dance and other art forms as movies theatres to 50 people or 50 per cent of the capacity of the premises, whichever is lesser.  These establishments must be able to ensure social distance of one to two metres between customers.
	3.    Immediate closures of all bingo and gaming events.
	4.    Immediate closure of all wellness centres offering physical activities, gyms, fitness centres and athletic clubs and training facilities

	“This is a time to support our friends, families and communities,” said Pallister.  “The situation is constantly evolving and changing rapidly.  Enacting a state of emergency will further our province’s ability to be nimble, act swiftly and support Manitobans when they need it most.”

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT INTRODUCES COVID-19 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENT TO BUDGET 2020
					  Most Emergency-Ready Budget in Manitoba History:  Fielding


	The Manitoba government is tabling a supplementary document that will outline measures in Budget 2020 to address the COVID-19 pandemic, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“Budget 2020 takes measures that serve as the foundation for the Manitoba government’s fiscal response to the fast-evolving public health and economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Fielding.  “Budget 2020 sets aside the largest amount of money in Manitoba history for emergency expenditures, and Manitobans should be reassured by this unprecedented level of fiscal resilience and flexibility to quickly deliver the resources required to respond to any emergency.”

	The province is taking significant financial and public health steps to ensure Manitobans are safe and protected at this time of rising economic and social anxiety, noted the minister.

	The budget supplement outlined key measures that contribute to Manitoba’s resiliency:
	•    reinvestment in the rainy day fund – over the coming month, the province will increase the Fiscal Stabilization Fund to $800 million from $571 million, and transfer an additional $72 million by the end of the 2020-21 fiscal year;
	•    prudent budgeting – the province has avoided $10 billion in debt over the past four years as a result of responsible financial decisions, as well as approximately $200 million of incremental interest costs;
	•    federal support – $18 million in federal support is available to Manitoba and Ottawa has indicated further aid is likely forthcoming; and
	•    a stable, resilient economy – with Manitoba’s diversified economic base, the province continues to have one of the most competitive and stable economies in Canada.  

	Overall, Manitoba has nearly $1 billion of financial flexibility to address this challenge, if required, the minister noted.

	“The steps our government has taken over the past four years to manage provincial finances more responsibly means that we are better positioned to respond to this and future emergencies and withstand the ongoing period of economic uncertainty,” said Fielding.  “Living in a province that regularly faces floods and other natural disasters has taught us the importance of being prepared for emergencies and having flexibility and agility in our planning and response.”

	Fielding noted the province is making the necessary investments to address the pandemic and implementing protocols to ensure funds are available in order to quickly respond to the rapidly changing situation.

	The COVID-19 response will also impact Manitoba’s forecasted budgetary revenues for the 2020-21 fiscal year, the minister said.  Preliminary estimates for Manitoba’s economy suggest a large initial decline in economic growth during the first half of 2020, followed by a recovery in the second half of the year.  Growth in 2021 may be higher than currently forecast as a result of the return of pent-up demand across impacted sectors, he noted.  The Budget 2020 supplement states that there are reasons to believe Manitoba will see a less significant decline than other jurisdictions, in part, given the province’s diversified economic base.

	The government’s 2019-20 third quarter fiscal update released in early March projected a $325-million deficit for the current fiscal year.  The province does not anticipate significant impacts that would disrupt that forecast.

	The Manitoba government will update its projections as the situation unfolds over the coming months.  Government departments continue to engage closely with key provincial stakeholders and other governments to mitigate the economic and public health challenges of this significant event, Fielding said.

	Visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19 for the most up-to date information on COVID-19.

	The COVID-19 Emergency Supplement to Budget 2020 will be posted with the rest of the budget documents at www.manitoba.ca/budget2020.

Backgrounder
Background Information


	Budget 2020 continues moving Manitoba forward and building a brighter future for all Manitobans, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today as he presented the provincial budget in the Manitoba legislature.

	“In just four years, Manitoba has made tremendous progress on the road to recovery,” said Fielding.  “Budget 2020 continues the hard work by focusing on the issues that matter most to Manitobans – by providing better services, protecting our environment, making our communities stronger and safer, making life more affordable, and building a better, brighter and more prosperous future for all Manitobans and their families.”

	The province is introducing a made-in-Manitoba Green Levy effective July 1 at a flat $25 per tonne that will not increase each year, unlike the federal government’s carbon tax.  The minister noted it will cost Manitoba families and businesses less than the federal carbon tax plan and will be more effective in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.  In order to offset the impact of the Green Levy, the government will lower the PST rate to six per cent as of July 1.

	“Budget 2020 delivers significant tax reductions which, combined with the 2019 tax cuts, are the largest in Manitoba history.  Manitoba will be the only province that has cut its sales tax in recent years and we’ve done it twice,” said Fielding.  “This PST rate reduction will ensure that all who pay the Green Levy will benefit through a lower sales tax rate.”

	Combined with last year’s PST rate reduction to seven per cent, Fielding estimated this additional reduction and implementation of the Green Levy will grow the provincial nominal GDP by $108 million, which is good for the environment and good for the economy.  It will increase labour income by an estimated $50 million annually and generate an estimated 1,042 person-years of employment growth.

	The PST reduction is expected to create an average annual savings of approximately $345 per household, with approximately 510,000 households in Manitoba.  Combined with an additional $131 in savings estimated to be passed along by Manitoba businesses, it results in total average savings of $476 per year to Manitoba households.

	The province will replenish the rainy day fund and will contribute an additional $300 million to the fund by the end of 2020-21.  This will result in a balance of $872 million, at which point the rainy day fund will be fully funded.

	“Our province will be in a far stronger position to respond to unforeseen emergencies and we have never been as prepared to deal with those situations,” said Fielding.  “While the previous government left Manitoba without the resources to respond to natural disasters, our government is replenishing the rainy day fund.”

	Additionally, the emergency expenditures contingency is increased to $100 million, which is effectively $86 million higher than it was in 2016, and an incremental $45 million available for infrastructure projects aimed at improving environmental resiliency.  The government is determined to complete the Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin Outlet Channels Project as soon as possible and Budget 2020 allocates a total of $101 million for the important flood mitigation initiative.

	The expected provincial deficit for Budget 2020 has been reduced to $220 million, an improvement of $140 million over the previous year.  Fielding also reconfirmed the government is on track to balance the budget within its current term.  Importantly, the province is also forecasting that its debt-to-GDP ratios will be declining over the next four years, which is a significant signal of improving fiscal health, the minister noted.

	“Supported by strong revenue growth and responsible expenditure controls, we are now one step closer to delivering a balanced budget during the current term of government,” said Fielding.  “We have modestly exceeded our plans each year and we are predicting, for the fourth year in a row, an improvement to our earlier forecasts.  We have reduced the deficit each year, while making record investments in health, in education and for families.  We have made life more affordable for Manitobans by cutting the retail sales tax rate, by ending income tax bracket creep and by eliminating many other fees.”

	Budget 2020 provides record investments in health care at $6.8 billion and education with $1.3 billion in operating grants to public school divisions.  The Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living budget includes funding for a range of capital projects, such as the Health Sciences Centre master campus plan and St. Boniface Hospital redevelopment, with a total strategic infrastructure budget of $1.8 billion.  A $160-million investment on capital projects in the kindergarten to Grade 12 education system will result in 4,425 new classroom spaces either open or under construction by the end of the 2020-21 fiscal year as the government builds seven new schools and several major additions and renovation projects.

	The budget commits to keeping Manitobans safe in their homes and communities, and strengthens provincial plans to work with communities and law enforcement to prevent crime.

	Public health officials advise the number of lab-confirmed positive and presumptive positive cases in Manitoba remains at 17 at this time.

	Public health investigations are continuing on the two additional positive cases identified yesterday.  It appears that both cases are related to travel.

	In an effort to protect patients, staff and the community, all Manitoba health-care facilities will soon begin implementing enhanced precautions and protocols which will involve additional visitor restrictions.  Exceptions for compassionate reasons will continue to be made on a case-by-case basis.

	This step follows public health’s recommendation earlier this week to suspend visitor access to long-term-care facilities across the province.  Similar to health-care facilities, exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of individual facility managers.

	Preparations continue to ensure acute care facilities are prepared in the event of COVID-19 patients requiring admissions.  Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg (HSC) has begun a series of moves as part of the provincially co-ordinated response.  A medicine unit will today be relocated to existing clinical space in the former HSC Women’s Pavilion at 735 Notre Dame Ave. to enable the movement of patients within the hospital campus to create a 30-bed isolation unit.

	Twenty-seven additional ventilators, which are crucial to caring for critically ill patients, have arrived and will be put into operation at health-care facilities throughout the province.  This brings Manitoba’s overall supply to 266.  It is anticipated an additional 16 ventilators, also ordered last week, will be delivered in the coming weeks.

	Agencies that offer day programs through Community Living disABILITY Services for adults with intellectual disabilities have been asked to limit this service as part of the effort to support social distancing efforts and reduce the potential spread of the virus.  As soon as possible, day services will only be offered to individuals who:
	•    live with family members who could lose their job if day services are not provided,
	•    are supported by home share providers who can’t provide care during daytime hours and where other arrangements are not possible, and

Backgrounder
Background Information


	Public health officials advise that two additional presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Manitoba.  This brings the total number of lab-confirmed positive and presumptive positive cases in Manitoba to 17.

	Case information includes:
	•    case 16 is a woman in her 50s who lives in Winnipeg; and
	•    case 17 is a man in his 70s who lives in Winnipeg.

	Public health investigations have begun and at this time, it appears that both cases are travel related.

	Manitoba’s first drive-thru community testing site for COVID-19 opened this afternoon in Selkirk.  The new site will see patients referred to the site drive up to be screened by health-care workers.  If necessary, they will be registered, tested and given advice on what to do while awaiting results without leaving their vehicle.  The Selkirk testing site, at 622 Superior Ave., will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  It is the ninth dedicated testing site to open in Manitoba in the past week.  There are four sites in Winnipeg, as well as locations in Brandon, Thompson, Flin Flon and The Pas.

	These testing sites are by referral only and are not walk-in clinics.  Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 before arriving at a testing site.

	CancerCare Manitoba is taking proactive measures to help reduce the impact of COVID-19.  Starting Thursday, breast cancer screening services at BreastCheck will be suspended for at least two weeks.  Clients will be notified directly to confirm that their appointments will be affected.  Clients can call (toll-free) 1-855-95-CHECK (24325) if they have any questions or concerns.

	All hemodialysis patients need to continue to go for dialysis treatments.  Hospitals and dialysis units are implementing many measures to ensure all hemodialysis patients are provided the safest care.  Dialysis treatments are life sustaining and going to a hospital for regularly scheduled dialysis treatments in a carefully managed environment is the SAFEST option for hemodialysis patients.

	Patients who skip or miss dialysis treatments may have adverse health outcomes and require emergency medical services such as urgent care or emergency department care.  Dialysis patients who have travelled internationally in the past 14 days or who experience flu-like symptoms should still call Health Links-Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 and their dialysis unit before going to the dialysis unit or hospital.

	Starting tomorrow, Employment and Income Assistance (EIA) clients are asked to contact staff through the call centre whenever possible, in order to follow public health recommendations on public distancing.  Phone lines are open Monday to Friday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 204-948-2888 (inside Winnipeg) or 1-855-944-8111 (toll-free, outside Winnipeg).  Clients can also email the department at eia@gov.mb.ca.  All EIA offices are still open during normal business hours (Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.) but it is recommended clients use phone or email options and avoid in-person visits.

	In light of recommendations about social distancing and limiting public gatherings, Manitoba Conservation and Climate has cancelled all planned interpreter-led events in Manitoba parks and has closed interpretive centres until further notice.  Parks remain open for day use at this time.  As long as people are healthy and able to do so, they can explore trails in provincial parks on their own or in small groups, while using good social distancing practices.

	The Parks Reservation Service will launch as scheduled next week.  For health and safety reasons, no in-person reservations will be accepted and reservations must be made online athttps://prspub.gov.mb.ca/ or through the call centre, at 204-948-3333 for people in Winnipeg and 1-888-482-2267 for all other areas of the province.  Users should log in to their account before the launch dates to confirm account information and to review reservation and camping policies.

	More than 2,100 patients have been screened for COVID-19 at dedicated testing sites in Winnipeg, Thompson, Flin Flon and The Pas in the past six days including about 430 yesterday.  The province’s eighth dedicated testing site opened today at the Brandon Regional Health Centre, in the Nurses’ Residence Gym  Hours at that location are daily from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

	Additional locations throughout the province will be announced in the days ahead.  The public is reminded that these sites are not walk-in clinics.  Manitobans are asked to call Health Links-Info Santé, who will be able to assess whether testing for COVID-19 is needed and can provide a referral.  The Health Links-Info Santé number is 204-788-8200 and 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free).

	Twenty students from the University of Manitoba have been added to support occupational health services, which is tasked with screening and responding to inquiries from staff and physicians who have returned from travelling internationally in the last 14 days.

	All staff and physicians with international travel history are required to contact occupational health services (OHS) immediately upon return.  Occupational health services staff are working within clinically determined and evidence-based guidelines to assess all returning staff.  All facilities and departments have been directed to identify staff and physicians who are operationally required.  Those individuals are then assessed by OHS for the type of work they do including consideration of their exposure to high-risk patients and the circumstances of their travel.

	Those operationally required staff and physicians who are cleared to return to work will have no or limited contact with patients, are required to wear personal protective equipment all times during their shift and must self-monitor for symptoms including monitoring their temperature twice per day.

	The Manitoba government is taking additional proactive measures to help reduce the impact of COVID-19.  This includes:
	•    suspending services at licensed child-care centres, effective end-of-day Friday, March 20;
	•    recommending parents with children in these centres begin to make alternate arrangements as soon as possible, even though centres will remain open for the remainder of the week;
	•    continuing to allow home-based child-care providers to operate; and
	•    creating dedicated child-care options for front-line and essential services staff who need them.

	Parents who will be providing front-line health care or are a member of a fire, police or paramedic service and will not be able to find alternative child care while services are suspended are asked to contact 204-945-0776 or 1-888-213-4754 (toll-free).

	Parents are asked to keep all children and youth home if they have a fever or other respiratory illness symptoms.  Schools will be notifying parents that students will be sent home if they have any of these symptoms.

	The province is also advising that:
	•    teachers will continue to be on the job, either in schools or at home, to create learning plans and continue teaching using the distance learning options available; and
	•    all casinos will close effective midnight tonight.

	Public health officials are recommending the immediate suspension of visitors in long-term care facilities across Manitoba.  Exceptions for compassionate reasons or end of life will be made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of individual facility managers.

	In addition, public health officials are recommending the cancellation of gatherings of more than 50 people, consistent with the announcement made by the federal government.

	Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential international travel.  In addition, public health officials are recommending all international travellers should self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after returning to Canada.

	Health officials are reminding physicians, health-care providers and support staff returning from international travel that they MUST self-identify to their organization/site’s occupational health services.

	A new self-assessment tool is now online to help Manitobans determine whether they need to call Health Links–Info Santé to possibly get a referral or to self-isolate.  The tool provides interactive advice to users concerned about whether they have contracted COVID-19.  It is expected the tool will help with call volumes.  For more information, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Additionally, people calling Health Links–Info Santé can soon expect to hear a new interactive voice response system (IVR).  The IVR will allow COVID-19 screening questions to be answered prior to users being connected to operators, which should shorten the length of calls.  This technology is anticipated to be up and running as soon as this afternoon.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 before arriving at a testing site.  Nearly 1,700 patients have visited dedicated testing sites in Winnipeg and Thompson in the past five days including 481 yesterday.

	•    patients older than 70 years of age;
	•    patients with significant underlying health conditions; and
	•    patients who are immune compromised.

	Patients will be contacted directly to confirm that their surgery is being affected.

	CancerCare Manitoba advises that patients with symptoms of a respiratory illness should not visit their sites.  Instead, patients with symptoms should call their health-care team and follow their instructions on next steps.  Cancer patients should check the website www.cancercare.mb.ca for regular updates to cancer patient information.

	Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential international travel.  In addition, public health officials are recommending all international travellers self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after returning to Canada.

	Work is underway to finalize guidelines for health-care workers and critical infrastructure workers who return from international travel to address any impacts on essential services.  All physicians, health-care providers and staff returning from international travel MUST self-identify to their organization/site’s occupational health services.

	Given the evolving COVID-19 situation, the health system is now implementing elevated precautions to protect patients, as many have underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk of becoming severely ill due to COVID-19.  Certain individuals should NOT visit acute care or long-term care facilities.  This includes those who have:
	•    returned from international travel in the last 14 days;
	•    been instructed to self-isolate for 14 days; or
	•    have cold or flu-like symptoms, such as a cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat, weakness or headache.

	Effective immediately, only one visitor per patient at a time is allowed in acute care facilities, such as hospitals, across Manitoba.  This does not apply to parents of children in hospital.  Also, exceptions will be made at a manager’s discretion for special circumstances, such as visitors who require an escort or those going to see a patient nearing the end of their life.

	In addition, Manitoba and Doctors Manitoba have agreed on new payment options to offer virtual visit and virtual care psychotherapy options to supplement traditional models of care including video-conferencing options.  Physicians will work with their patients to use these options.

	Transportation industry partners needs to ensure all companies are made aware of important considerations with respect to essential cross-border crossings.  At this time, public health officials are not mandating drivers to self-isolate after crossing the border to ensure essential services continue.

	Manitoba’s adult and youth correctional facilities continue to allow visitors, with restrictions in place to protect the health and safety of people in custody as well as staff.  Visits from family members will continue to be allowed but with no contact.  Visits with legal counsel will continue with no changes.  All centres have suspended all visits from volunteers and community agencies until further notice.

	There have been reports of multiple phishing scams related to COVID-19.  Many are asking people for credit card information to provide medication following a positive test results.  This is not a call that Manitobans would receive from public health officials.  Manitobans are advised to not provide any financial data, hang up on the call and to report to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at (toll-free) 1-888-495-8501.

	Three additional presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Manitoba.  This brings the number of lab-confirmed positive cases in Manitoba to four and presumptive positive cases to three, for a total of seven cases.

	Case five is a man in his 70s.  Case six is a woman in her 70s and at this time, it appears this woman was exposed to the virus through recent travel.  Case seven is a woman in her 50s.  Patient contact and public health investigations are ongoing.

	All Manitobans, including health-care providers, are strongly advised to cancel or postpone any non-essential international travel.  In addition, public health officials are recommending all international travellers should self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after returning to Canada.  Work is underway to develop guidelines for screening of Manitoba health-care workers returning to Canada following international travel.

	Winnipeg’s four dedicated testing sites for COVID-19 have seen 900 patients in the past three days including 268 yesterday.  The public is reminded that these sites are not walk-in clinics.  International travellers who have developed cold- or flu-like symptoms within 14 days of returning to Canada should contact Health Links-Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 to be referred for testing at these sites.

	Health Links received more than 1,000 calls yesterday.  Staffing numbers continue to be increased and technical enhancements are being worked on including an online self-assessment tool that will help Manitobans identify whether they need to be tested for the virus.  It is anticipated this tool will be available in the next few days.

	HSC Winnipeg is restricting the number of public entrances to the campus beginning today, so visitors can be properly screened for COVID-19 upon arrival.  These restrictions will protect patients who may have underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk of severe illness due to COVID-19.  Patients are now only allowed one visitor at a time.  Exceptions will be made at a manager’s discretion for special circumstances, such as visitors who require an escort or those going to see a patient nearing the end of their life.

	Similar measures are being considered for other health-care facilities throughout the province and at long-term care homes.

	Visitors arriving at facilities throughout Manitoba’s health system can expect to be screened upon arrival for COVID-19.  If visitors are ill or have travelled internationally in the past 14 days, or if they have been instructed to self-monitor or self-isolate, they are strongly encouraged to stay home for the well-being of staff, volunteers, patients and the general public.

	CancerCare Manitoba is asking patients with upcoming appointments or tests to call ahead.  Cancer patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19 due to weakened immune systems, so appointments and tests may be rescheduled if not considered urgent or patients are not actively being treated for the disease.

	Similarly, patients living with kidney disease are also at higher risk of infection.  Scheduled dialysis treatments are proceeding as usual for patients who are well.  However, dialysis patients experiencing cold- or flu-like symptoms who have returned from international travel in the past 14 days are asked to call Health Links-Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257 for an initial assessment.  They are also asked to call their renal unit before leaving home for a dialysis treatment or clinic visit so staff can prepare to treat them in a way that keeps them and others from possibly being exposed to COVID-19.

	In keeping with social distancing strategies outlined to Manitobans and in consultation with key stakeholders, public health officials have advised suspending classes in Manitoba kindergarten to Grade 12 schools effective March 23 to April 10.  This is being done to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Manitoba.

	Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:
	•    ensure ill staff and students stay home from school, and support those who are self-isolating at home to ensure they do not fall behind in their studies;
	•    reduce activities in large groups and crowds;
	•    increase desk distance between students; and
	•    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms to reduce the number of people in classrooms and increase distance between staff and students.

	Public health officials continue to recommend social distancing measures for all Manitobans including:
	•    cancelling or postponing any large-scale events (events with more than 250 attendees);
	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;

	Three previously announced presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 have been lab confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed positive cases in Manitoba to four.  Public health investigations are continuing, but it appears that all four cases are travel related.

	In keeping with social distancing strategies outlined to Manitobans and in consultation with key stakeholders, public health officials have advised suspending classes in Manitoba kindergarten to Grade 12 schools effective March 23 to April 10.  This is being done to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Manitoba.

	Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:
	•    ensure ill staff and students stay home from school, and support those who are self-isolating at home to ensure they do not fall behind in their studies;
	•    reduce activities in large groups and crowds;
	•    increase desk distance between students; and
	•    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms to reduce the number of people in classrooms and increase distance between staff and students.

	Testing for COVID-19 has increased to more than 500 tests per day.  Staff at the Cadham Provincial Laboratory are working hard to ensure results are available within 24 to 48 hours after a test is received at the lab.  Once a positive test result is identified, the patient is notified by public health immediately.

	Technical improvements were made to Health Links–Info Santé on Friday, allowing the service to handle more than 100 callers simultaneously, which is nearly triple its usual capacity.  Further technical enhancements are being worked on and staffing numbers continue to be increased.  The public is asked to continue to contact Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for COVID-19 and other health concerns including international travellers who have developed cold- or flu-like symptoms within the past 14 days of returning to Canada.

	All health-care providers in the province are being strongly advised to cancel or postpone all non-essential travel outside of Manitoba.  All staff have been told they should be prepared to self-isolate for 14 days if they choose to travel internationally including to the United States.

	Public health officials continue to recommend social distancing measures for all Manitobans including:
	•    cancelling or postponing any large-scale events (events with more than 250 attendees);
	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;
	•    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;
	•    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;
	•    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill with the virus; and
	•    avoiding all non-essential travel, as well as crowded places and events.

	Health-care providers are strongly discouraging the public from visiting any health-care facility, including long-term care facilities, if they have:
	•    returned from international travel in the past 14 days;
	•    been directed to self-monitor or self-isolate for 14 days; or
	•    are experiencing cold and flu symptoms, such as a cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat, headache or weakness.

	Visitors arriving at health-care facilities may also be asked direct questions about their symptoms, contacts and travel history upon arrival.  This includes HSC Winnipeg, which will begin restricting access points to the campus on Sunday to ensure proper screening of visitors arriving at the facility can occur.

	Traffic at the four community screening locations in Winnipeg continues.  These locations include Access sites in Fort Garry, Winnipeg West and Transcona, as well as the Mount Carmel Clinic.  All sites are open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. this weekend, and 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  Patients should be referred for testing to attend to the community screening locations.  Walk-in traffic without a referral is discouraged.

	Additionally, HSC Winnipeg has also opened a testing clinic for low-acuity patients in its William Avenue mall, where patients can be tested for both COVID-19 and influenza.

	Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps to ensure employees can stay home when ill, without facing barriers such as the requirement for sick notes, and work from home if possible.  Employers should also discontinue non-essential, work-related travel outside of Manitoba and encourage virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, close contact between individuals.

	To date, three presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Manitoba.  In addition, Manitoba public health officials are recommending that Manitobans should consider taking additional social distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

	Public health is updating a flight number from Vancouver International Airport to Winnipeg where individuals may have been exposed to COVID-19.  Individuals on Air Canada flight AC 8622 on March 7 and March 8 in rows 24 to 29 are asked to self-isolate and monitor themselves for symptoms for 14 days since their last known contact or exposure.  For more information on self-isolation and self-monitoring, visit www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/factsheets/coronavirus_selfisolation.pdf.

	Social distancing measures include cancelling or postponing any large-scale events with more than 250 attendees.  This measure helps reduce prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between other individuals in public.

	In addition, individuals in Winnipeg directed by Health Links–Info Santé to be tested for COVID-19 will be asked to visit a community screening location.  Two new screening sites will both open at noon today.

	One is at Mount Carmel Clinic (886 Main St.) and the other is at Access Transcona (845 Regent Ave. W.).  This is in addition to two other sites that opened on March 12 at Access Winnipeg West (at 280 Booth Dr.) and Access Fort Garry (135 Plaza Dr.)

	These four sites will serve as COVID-19 community screening sites, in addition to continuing with their regular operations.  Patients should be referred for testing to attend to the community screening locations.  Walk-in traffic without a referral is discouraged.

	Testing at these sites will be available Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Those who require screening, assessment and/or testing after hours will still be directed to urgent care sites and emergency departments.

	People living outside Winnipeg who are concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 can visit www.gov.mb.ca/health/coronavirus/ or call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for further information.

	Work is also underway to increase capacity at Health Links–Info Santé.  Staffing levels have been doubled and additional staff are being pulled in from other areas and trained today.  Caller options have been streamlined and there is now a dedicated COVID-19 number to press.  Usual scripts have also been shortened to reduce the length of calls once they are answered.

	Public health officials continue to recommend these social distancing measures for all Manitobans:
	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;
	•    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;
	•    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;
	•    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill with the virus; and

Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) and public health officials are advising Manitobans of the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in the province.

	A woman in her 40s who lives in the area of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority has tested positive for COVID-19.  At this time, it appears the individual was exposed to the virus through recent travel to the Philippines.  The individual is recovering at home in stable condition.

	As of March 11, 403 tests have been completed for COVID-19 in Manitoba.  

	A pandemic has now been declared by the World Health Organization, and social distancing strategies are now being recommended to all Manitobans to limit the spread of COVID-19.

	Those at the greatest risk of severe outcomes include those over 65 years of age, those with underlying medical conditions and those with compromised immune systems.  Public health officials are also reminding all Manitobans to frequently wash their hands, cough and sneeze into their sleeves and to stay home when sick.

	Social distancing strategies for all Manitobans include:
	•    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between other individuals in public;
	•    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;
	•    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;
	•    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill with the virus; and
	•    considering avoiding travel, crowded places and events, especially if you are at higher risk.
	    
	Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:
	•    ensure ill staff and students stay home from school, and support those who are self-isolating at home to ensure they do not fall behind in their studies;
	•    reduce large-group, crowded activities;
	•    increase desk distance between students; and
	•    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms, which reduces the number of people in classrooms and increases distance between staff and students.

	Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps to ensure their employees can:
	•    stay home when ill, without facing barriers such as the requirement for sick notes; and
	•    work from home if possible.

	Employers should also consider:
	•    discontinuing non-essential work related travel outside of Manitoba; and
	•    encouraging virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, close contact between individuals.

	Manitobans are strongly advised to review travel plans given the evolving risk throughout many parts of the world and Canada.  Frequently review the Government of Canada’s COVID-19 related travel advisories at www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html.

MANITOBA INTRODUCES LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CLARIFY SCOPE OF TRIBUNALS, IMPROVE TIMELINESS OF REVIEWS OF HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLAINTS


	The Manitoba government has introduced two pieces of legislation that would clarify and streamline the work of important decision-making bodies, with the goal of providing more timely access for Manitobans, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	The administrative tribunal jurisdiction act would allow government to determine which have the authority to hear constitutional and charter issues, recognizing these decisions require specialized expertise.  

	“Administrative tribunals are important decision-making bodies, responsible for a broad range of issues that affect Manitobans’ lives,” said Cullen.  “However, it is inefficient and impractical for all of them to make decisions on complex constitutional matters.  This legislation would allow government to clarify roles, ensuring all administrative tribunals can provide more timely decisions for Manitobans in their areas of expertise.”

	There are dozens of administrative tribunals in Manitoba, responsible for making decisions on a broad range of matters.  This includes the Residential Tenancies Commission, which hears disputes between landlords and tenants; the Automobile Injury Compensation Appeal Commission, which hears complaints about payments for bodily injuries paid by Manitoba Public Insurance; and the Judicial Council, which hears charges of misconduct involving provincial court judges.

	The minister noted it would be inefficient for all tribunals to hear constitutional issues, as the need to access external legal expertise or provide members with the necessary legal background could add significant delays and costs.  

	Following a legal review and analysis, the province would determine which administrative tribunals would have jurisdiction to decide questions of constitutional law and formalize this approach in regulation.  Alberta and British Columbia have similar legislation in place to clarify which tribunals can hear constitutional issues.

	The second piece of legislation introduced today is The Human Rights Code Amendment Act.  It builds on an independent review of the Manitoba Human Rights Commission and the Manitoba Human Rights Adjudication Panel and its recommendations to address complaints in a more timely and efficient manner.

	The amendments would empower the commission to make decisions sooner by allowing the commission’s executive director to dismiss complaints, including those outside its jurisdiction, and to decline to investigate complaints that are being adequately addressed in another forum.  The process for adjudication would be improved by giving adjudicators the authority to mediate complaints and setting time limits to ensure the adjudicators’ hearings and decisions are timely.

	The changes would also set the maximum financial award for injury to dignity, feelings or self-respect stemming from a human rights complaint at $25,000.  There would continue to be no cap on other compensation dealing with lost wages, income or benefits and existing caps on financial penalties related to malicious or reckless actions remain in place.

	“Our government is taking steps to respond to the independent review of the commission and adjudication panel,” said Cullen. “In the past, it has sometimes taken years for a human rights complaint to come to a conclusion.  These amendments will help ensure Manitobans who file a human rights complaint can be confident their matter will be handled in a fair and timely way.”  

	The independent review of the Manitoba Human Rights Commission and the Manitoba Human Rights Adjudication Panel is available at www.manitoba.ca/openmb/infomb/departments.html under Manitoba Justice.

March 10, 2020
PROVINCE ANNOUNCES PAYROLL TAX CUT
					  Changes Will Benefit an Estimated 1,000 Employers Throughout Manitoba:  Fielding


	As part of Budget 2020, the Manitoba government is providing employers with a break on the Health and Post-Secondary Education Tax Levy, commonly called the payroll tax, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“Too many small businesses are paying payroll taxes, which penalizes those who can least afford it,” said Fielding.  “It’s another form of bracket creep and it discourages entrepreneurship and costs jobs.  Budget 2020 increases the payroll tax thresholds, which will result in more jobs and more opportunities for Manitobans.”

	The Health and Post Secondary Education Tax Levy is imposed on wages paid by employers with a permanent establishment in the province.  Approximately 3,000 employers in Manitoba pay around $510 million in payroll taxes per year.

	As of Jan. 1, 2021, Manitoba will increase the following payroll tax thresholds:
	•    employers with an annual payroll of $1.5 million or less will be exempt (up from the current $1.25 million exemption threshold);
	•    employers with an annual payroll between $1.5 million and $3 million will pay 4.3 per cent on the amount within this range (up from the current range of $1.25 million to $2.5 million); and
	•    employers with an annual payroll above $3 million will pay 2.15 per cent of the total payroll (up from the current $2.5 million threshold).

	The increased thresholds are expected to benefit approximately 1,000 employers in Manitoba, and make approximately 220 employers exempt from paying the tax altogether.

	“We have heard from Manitoba business owners and operators that one of the key factors affecting business growth is the tax burden, in particular payroll taxes that affect business growth the most,” said Fielding.  “We are addressing this concern with these changes to make Manitoba an even more attractive place to do business.”

	Manitoba’s payroll tax thresholds have not changed since 2008.

	“Initiatives like this one from the Manitoba government have meaningful impact on businesses like ours,” said Jamie Kozak, Principal Architect at Prairie Architects Inc., a business that will become exempt from paying the tax next year.  “Raising the payroll tax exemption to $1.5 million allows our company to reinvest approximately $5,000 back into our business operations every year.”

	Prairie Architects Inc. is leading the Fort Richmond Collegiate New Life Skills Suite and Band Room Addition and Renovations project, into which the provincial government is investing $1 million.  Fielding visited the work site today to present a new pair of steel-toed work boots to Jaycek Valentine, a junior apprentice on the project.

	This is the fifth year in a row where the Manitoba government carried on its tradition of presenting a new pair of shoes to a deserving Manitoban, rather than the finance minister purchasing himself new shoes to wear on budget day.

	“These work boots symbolize one of our government’s priorities – to create more jobs for Manitobans and drive economic growth,” said Fielding.  “Our Economic Growth Action Plan is growing optimism throughout the province and we are working to create 40,000 new jobs during the current term of government.  We know we are on the right path, as approximately 9,700 more Manitobans were working in the first two months of 2020.”

	Fielding will present Budget 2020 tomorrow afternoon in the Manitoba legislature.

PROVINCE WORKING WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO PURCHASE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR HEALTH WORKERS AND PATIENTS
					  Equipment Will Ensure Patients and Front-Line Workers Have the Protective Equipment They Need To Stay Safe and Minimize Spread of COVID-19: Friesen


	The Manitoba government is working with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), and provinces and territories, to co-ordinate a procurement effort of protective equipment to prepare for the possibility of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Our government, along with provinces and territories, is taking inventory of the personal protective equipment (PPE) currently in our jurisdiction, and planning for what would additionally be required in the event of an outbreak,” said Friesen.  “Ensuring staff throughout the health system have access to the equipment and supplies required for safe patient care and their own personal protection is a priority.”

	Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) is co-managing a provincially co-ordinated Incident Management Structure to ensure appropriate planning, preparation, mitigation and response to the evolving COVID-19 situation, the minister added.  While Manitoba has an adequate supply of PPE at this time, this purchase will ensure the province is well positioned to manage any additional demand on resources that would accompany potential or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Manitoba.

	Current inventory of PPE supplies is being closely monitored, and regions and sites have been asked to take steps to ensure supplies of PPE, including procedure/surgical masks and N95 respirators, are maintained and that providers and staff are aware of their appropriate clinical use.

	The purchase will help to ensure patients, staff, and front-line health workers, have appropriate protective equipment at a competitive price.  The determination of the volume of supplies needed is undertaken collaboratively with the assistance of the Public Health Agency of Canada.  Most personal protective equipment used in clinical environments will not spoil.

	Based on current planning assumptions, including supplies required by Manitoba’s regional health authorities, service delivery organizations, personal care homes and fee-for-service clinics, the projected cost is an estimated $35.2 million.

	PPE supplies are being utilized as health-care facilities and sites across the province in line with clinical recommendations.  This includes use by staff of gloves, gowns, procedure or surgical masks and face/eye protection when dealing with any patients who have flu-like symptoms (cough, fever, difficulty breathing).  Procedure or surgical masks are also provided to patients who show these symptoms, as well as anyone accompanying them.  

	Staff performing certain procedures are required to wear an N95 respirator in addition to eye-protection, gloves and a gown.  Efforts to ensure staff are appropriately trained and fit-tested for the N95 are underway across the province.

	“The government and public health officials are reminding Manitobans the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in Manitoba remains low, but is increasing given events occurring in Canada and around the world.  We must continue to prepare for this virus in Manitoba,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief public health officer.

	The Manitoba government is working with Shared Health, Manitoba’s regional health authorities and service delivery organizations as well as the Public Health Agency of Canada to share information and best practices.

	Common personal prevention and preparedness measures for viruses such as COVID-19 and influenza include regular hand washing with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and staying home when you are sick, regardless of recent travel.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.

	The Manitoba government is seeking input from Manitobans to ensure its project to name geographical features in honour of Manitoba soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War also respects local and historical geographical names, Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“We will be commemorating the ultimate sacrifices made by Manitoba soldiers in the First World War by naming nearly 8,000 geographical features in their honour,” said Pedersen.  “As part of that process, we also want to respect places that already have local or historical names.  We are calling on Manitobans to help us with this important work.”

	Only geographical features with no known local names will become part of the First World War commemoration project, which is expected to be complete later this year.  The minister noted public input will help ensure local culture and history are represented and recorded as part of the process. 

	Manitoba has already named more than 4,200 lakes, islands, bays and other geographical features to honour fallen Manitoba soldiers who served from the Second World War to the present day.

	To review the geographical features proposed for naming, visit https://engagemb.ca/world-war-I-commemorative-naming-project. Manitobans may also contact the Manitoba Geographical Names Program at GeographicalNames@gov.mb.ca or the regional conservation district offices in The Pas or Thompson.

LAKE MANITOBA AND LAKE ST. MARTIN OUTLET CHANNELS PROJECT REACHES MILESTONE


	The Lake Manitoba Lake St. Martin Outlet Channels project has advanced to the next phase of the assessment process, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“Completing this crucial climate-change adaptation project – a project that will provide certainty for many communities and families – is one of our government’s top priorities and I am proud of the work we have done to reach this stage,” said Schuler.  “We are pleased to share the Environmental Impact Statement for public comment and we are eager to begin the next phase of the environmental assessment process, which is the technical review.”

	In 2011, Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin reached record high water levels.  The province has committed to building two permanent outlet channels to alleviate flooding in that part of the Interlake region.

	“We have worked hard to achieve progress on this project, spent more than $50 million in consultation and preliminary engineering, design and preparation work,” said Schuler.  “We are very pleased the federal government is committed to working together, and that we’re finally achieving progress on project timelines, while being respectful to all concerned.”

	Before construction begins, the project requires federal and provincial regulatory approvals.  Both governments will continue to engage in Crown-Indigenous consultations with all potentially impacted communities, and the province is in the process of signing consultation agreements with Indigenous communities.

	During the next stage, set to begin immediately, the federal and provincial governments will be seeking feedback from subject matter experts, the public and Indigenous communities through the public registries to address further concerns and clarification.

	“Jointly with our partners in the federal government, we will be investing resources to ensure meaningful consultation and co-ordination with Indigenous communities and other stakeholders,” said Schuler.  “We are confident in the merits of the project and look forward to any feedback the federal government, Indigenous groups and communities, and stakeholders will provide.”

	To date, the province has engaged with 39 Indigenous communities and groups identified by provincial and federal requirements, and is in the process of signing consultation agreements with 10 First Nation communities that will be impacted by the project.

	Increasing frequency of severe weather and flood events creates an even more pressing need to put safeguards in place to protect communities and families, the minister said.  Projects like these and other adaptation infrastructure, will help give communities and families their lives back while setting Manitoba on a course for greater security and economic certainty, he added.

	The public can view the Environmental Impact Statement at www.gov.mb.ca/sd/eal/registries/index.html and learn more about the outlet channels project at www.manitoba.ca/outletchannels.

MANITOBA INTRODUCES LEGISLATION THAT WOULD  IMPROVE ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES


	The Manitoba government is introducing legislation that would provide more affordable and accessible options for legal information and representation while still ensuring appropriate public protections are in place, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“The current approach to accessing legal advice is limited, with few options available to Manitobans,” said Cullen.  “For some people, the cost of hiring a lawyer is prohibitive, meaning they go without the advice they need.  Others need some advice and support, but not the full scope of legal services that a lawyer provides.  This change enables the creation and regulation of alternative legal service providers to meet the needs of Manitobans, improving access to justice for all.”

	The practice of law is regulated by the Law Society of Manitoba and currently, for the most part, legal services can only be provided by lawyers and articling students.  The proposed amendments to The Legal Profession Act would allow the Law Society to designate and regulate another category of regulated legal service provider, called a limited practitioner, who can provide specified legal services.  The legislation would also allow the Law Society to determine who could be designated as a limited practitioner, what their scope of work might be, and what training and education would be required.

	“The benchers of the Law Society of Manitoba are committed to being leaders in the advancement of increased access to justice for all Manitobans,” said Anita Southall, president, Law Society of Manitoba.  “This proposed legislation will permit the Law Society to establish the scope of practice for limited practitioners and to ensure that those who provide services will only do so with appropriate training and education, and in prescribed areas that pose no risk to the public.”

	The minister noted these changes could help support plans to modernize and streamline the family law system in Manitoba.  For example, changes might enable a limited practitioner to provide advice on parenting arrangements, child and spousal support, or how to handle shared property.  

	“By extending the authority of the Law Society in this way, the scope of work handled by limited practitioners can evolve to better meet the legal needs of Manitobans,” said Cullen.  “It has the expertise of regulating legal services in the public interest.”

	The Law Society recommended changes to government following its review of alternative legal service providers, which found there were unmet legal needs in the province and there was a need for more affordable alternatives for legal advice, information and representation.  The legislative changes are modelled on similar amendments recently introduced in Saskatchewan.

PROVINCE TO MODERNIZE LICENSING FOR OUTDOOR ENTHUSIASTS, IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY AND ACCESSIBILITY
					  Gradual Rollout Starts with Hunting, Angling Licences and Provincial Park Vehicle Permits


	The Manitoba government has introduced legislation that would pave the way for a new, online service for the sale of outdoor licenses and permits, Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard and Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“There are endless adventures to be had in our great outdoors,” said Guillemard.  “We are excited to improve and modernize the way Manitobans and visitors access and enjoy the many outdoor activities offered throughout our province and in our provincial parks.  Moving to an online system from a paper-based one will enable our government to improve the services we deliver, while decreasing our carbon footprint.”

	The province recognizes this is a significant change in the way people will access licences and park permits so it will be phased in, starting with hunting and angling licenses as well as provincial park vehicle permits this spring, Guillemard said.

	Users would be able to go online, create a customer profile, select the desired product or licence, and check out as they would with any other online purchase.  There will also be an option to purchase licences and permits online at Manitoba Conservation and Climate offices around the province and at participating retailers.  A digital copy of the licence would be available to download from the customer’s account and a copy must be printed out and carried while hunting or fishing so it can be presented upon request.  Park vehicle permits would also have to be printed for display on the vehicle’s dashboard.

	“The Manitoba Wildlife Federation has been advocating to have e-licensing brought to the province for years,” said Chris Heald, executive director, Manitoba Wildlife Federation.  “We appreciate the work that has gone into this project and are glad to see the province has listened to the voice of hunters, anglers and trappers.  We look forward to having access to the added convenience this system allows.”

	Benefits of using an e-licensing approach would include:
	•    access 24 hours a day, seven days a week online or by telephone;   
	•    access through participating retailers (list will be available online);
	•    the ability to immediately purchase and print licenses and permits at home;
	•    receiving email confirmation of licences/permits purchased; and
	•    improved data collection that will support program management.
	 
	“With expanded access such as the ability to make purchases from a smartphone or mobile device, we are using technology to move Manitoba forward,” said Pedersen.  “As Manitobans embrace the new system, we will roll out additional licences and permits for purchase online and continue taking steps to improve our services.”

	This initiative is a priority as identified in the ministers’ mandate letter, and supports the government’s commitment to enhance public services, reduce red tape and advance innovative technology solutions.

	In addition to current base licence fees, an administration fee of $4.50 will be included in all licences and permit purchases to support enhanced service delivery, with the exception of the Manitoba Resident Seniors Conservation Angling Licences that will remain free of charge.

					  Municipalities Provided Fair Say to Strengthen Election Rules:  Squires


	The Manitoba government has introduced legislative changes that would increase transparency, create a level playing field and provide a fair say to municipalities for municipal elections, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires announced today.

	“Voters in municipal elections should have the same assurances as those in provincial elections that their elected officials are not unfairly using their position as incumbents or using taxpayer resources to influence voters,” Squires said.  “These changes also include measures that have been requested by municipalities that will reduce red tape for them during elections.”

	The proposed changes include measures such as:
	•    giving fair say to municipalities to pass a bylaw establishing rules and procedures for the use of municipal resources in a municipal election by candidates;
	•    restricting incumbents from using their position title in election communication;
	•    allowing Brandon, Thompson, Portage la Prairie and Flin Flon to set their council size, aligning practices among all other municipalities outside of Winnipeg;   
	•    streamlining how all municipalities are required to refund excess taxes in a fair manner, effective July 1;
	•    exempting regional public libraries from municipal taxation to ensure public libraries remain exempt from municipal taxation; and
	•    strengthening provisions to protect vulnerable Winnipeg residents facing a tax sale from unscrupulous lenders.

	The province has had ongoing consultations with the Association of Manitoba Municipalities and many of these changes are the result of municipal requests.  Additional consultations will occur as the changes are implemented, as they are expected to be in effect for the 2022 Municipal General Election, the minister noted.

	Manitoba is recognizing International Women’s Day by launching a new awards program to honour women who have made outstanding contributions to the advancement of gender equality, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox, minister responsible for the status of women, announced today.

	“Women make important contributions that enrich all aspects of life in Manitoba including community service, law, education, arts and culture,” said Cox.  “As we celebrate International Women’s Day in 2020, I’m proud to announce the ‘Empower Women 20/20 Awards’, which will honour the outstanding women who have helped to further gender equality in our province.”

	In all, 20 awards will be presented to recognize women who have developed activities, programs or movements to advance gender equality in Manitoba, reflecting the province’s rich diversity and regional representation.  The Manitoba Women’s Advisory Council will play a role in reviewing all the award nominations.

	International Women’s Day (March 8) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women.  The day also marks a call to action for accelerating women’s equality.

	This year marks the 100-year anniversary of the election of Edith Rogers, the first woman elected to the Manitoba legislative assembly.

	“Manitoba women began the movement of women getting the right to vote and be elected to the provincial legislature in 1916 and the 1920 election was the first after the change in legislation,” Cox said.  “Edith ran in 1920, 1922 and 1927 – winning her seat in all three elections.  Beyond her career in politics, she was also active with various organizations in Manitoba and was a strong advocate for soldiers’ dependents after the First World War.”

	The names of this year’s award recipients will be announced during Gender Equality Week, Sept. 20 to 26.  More information and nomination forms can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/msw/empower_women_2020.html.

					  Partnership Will Help Encourage Manitobans to Share Tips on Illicit Drugs: Cullen

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is investing $180,000 to support a co-ordinated provincewide campaign led by Crime Stoppers to help identify and stop methamphetamine dealers and traffickers, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“Criminals dealing illicit drugs, and particularly meth, are a danger to all Manitobans,” said Cullen.  “This partnership with Crime Stoppers will help ensure Manitobans with important information to share can feel safe making an anonymous report to better their community.  We believe this campaign will clearly highlight why it is important to call the tip line and be a part of the solution.”

	The three Crime Stoppers organizations serving Manitoba will jointly develop a multimedia campaign to encourage people to report information about meth-related crimes, such as dealing or trafficking.  The campaign is expected to launch across the province this week.  Funding will also be used to expand cash awards available to people who provide anonymous tips that result in meth-related arrests, building on the organizations’ existing successful approach.

	“Law enforcement can not win this battle on their own,” said Paul Johnson, chair, Winnipeg Crime Stoppers.  “They need everyone’s help to provide the information they need to stop the flow of methamphetamine into our communities.  Every piece of information – no matter how trivial – is important.  The three Crime Stoppers programs are proud to be part of that community to create a ‘made-in-Manitoba solution’ to address this crisis.”

	The provincial investment is provided through the Federal Proceeds of Crime Fund, which is forfeited from federally prosecuted Criminal Code offences.  The province has also distributed nearly
	$2.5 million to law enforcement agencies across Manitoba from this fund and the Criminal Property Forfeiture Fund this year.  It has been used to:
	•    purchase specialized equipment and training for police agencies to improve officer and community safety,
	•    support the victims’ assistance fund, and
	•    invest in community organizations leading public safety and crime prevention initiatives.

	For more information about criminal property forfeiture, visit www.gov.mb.ca/justice/commsafe/cpf/index.html.

	The minister noted this project follows other recently announced initiatives valued at more than
	$25 million to continue improving mental health and addictions services in Manitoba including:
	•    a request for proposals to add 100 supportive recovery-housing beds,
	•    recruiting new community helpers,
	•    investing in a collaboration between StreetReach Winnipeg and the Manitoba Adolescent Treatment Centre, and
	•    expanding the distribution of Thrival Kits.

	Every year, Crime Stoppers organizations in Manitoba receive more than 4,200 anonymous tips from Manitobans. For more information, visit www.winnipegcrimestoppers.org/,  www.brandoncrimestoppers.com/  or http://manitobacrimestoppers.com/.

	Manitoba’s employment levels are off to a strong start in 2020, according to the latest report from Statistics Canada, Finance Minister Scott Fielding and Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“Our government is moving forward on our commitment to grow Manitoba’s economy and create 40,000 new jobs over the next four years by fixing our finances and making the province an attractive place to do business,” said Fielding.  “Manitoba’s labour market remains strong as shown by our solid track record to date.”

	The latest figures show an employment increase of 3,200 in February in Manitoba.  It follows an increase of 6,500 in January, resulting in approximately 9,700 more Manitobans working in the first two months of 2020.

	According to the latest figures, Manitoba increased by more than double the national average.  The increase in employment in February was accompanied by a decline in Manitoba’s unemployment rate to five per cent, down from 5.1 per cent in January and 5.3 per cent in 2019.  Manitoba continues to have the second lowest unemployment rate among Canadian provinces.

	“We are working with industry and employers to ensure Manitoba workers will have the knowledge and skills they need to meet the needs of in-demand careers now and in the future,” said Eichler. “This is proving to be an effective strategy to continue job market growth.”

	The province’s labour force has increased by 2,800 workers, a 0.4 per cent increase, while the country’s rate as a whole increased by 0.2 per cent.  Compared to the previous February, the labour force increased 1.3 per cent in Manitoba.

CANADA AND MANITOBA LAUNCH APPLICATION PROCESS FOR THE EFFICIENT TRUCKING PROGRAM


	A growing number of Canadians are choosing clean transportation. This choice saves energy and money while protecting the environment and building clean transportation networks brings good jobs and economic growth. That’s why the Government of Canada is focusing on finding faster, cheaper, cleaner ways to get Canadians where they are going.

	Today, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, and Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard, launched the application process for Manitoba’s Efficient Trucking Program.

	This program is now accepting proposals that will support retrofits in the transportation sector. Eligible applicants can receive a rebate of up to 50 per cent on fuel-saving devices and technologies like idling technologies, low-rolling resistant tires and trailer skirts. The program will be delivered by Red River College and will reduce energy consumption and emissions in Manitoba. Interested applicants with innovative technologies have until March 31 to apply through www.gov.mb.ca/climateandgreenplan/index.html.

	The Efficient Trucking Program will receive up to $5.9 million through the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund. The government of Manitoba is also contributing $5.9 million toward the program.

	Canada’s climate plan is on track to deliver the largest emissions reduction in the country’s history but these initiatives are just the beginning. The federal government will continue to bring forward new and enhanced climate action measures to exceed its 2030 target and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

	“Our government is committed to keeping children safe, but as technology changes and evolves, so do the risks,” said Stefanson, who signed a proclamation today to designate March 9 to 15 as Stop Child Sexual Exploitation Awareness Week in Manitoba.  “C3P is a recognized expert in talking to parents, young people and educators about important issues like digital safety and online exploitation.  We are happy to partner with them on campaigns to help keep us all better informed and ready to intervene when it is needed.”

	Every year, the Manitoba government invests millions of dollars to address sexual exploitation through Tracia’s Trust, the province’s strategy to deal with this important issue.  Today, the ministers announced an additional $83,000 to C3P to develop and launch an online campaign through Cybertip.ca this spring to help parents of tweens, aged nine to 12, better understand the risks associated with livestreaming, gaming platforms and live chat features.  Lessons will also be developed for teachers to share with students on how to identify and respond to unsafe situations online.  Supporting information will be shared through C3P’s Kids in the Know newsletter. 

	Another $20,000 has been invested by the province through the Federal Proceeds of Crime Fund to expand educational resources related to preventing sexual exploitation and supporting online safety into two additional school divisions in Winnipeg.

	“Our partnership will help ensure more Manitoba youth, parents and educators have the knowledge and tools to be safe online and in their daily lives,” said Cullen.  “As the potential risks related to exploitation, cyberbullying and other types of victimization evolve, it is essential to have accurate and timely information.  We are proud to partner with C3P, a recognized national leader, to help keep kids safe.”

	Funding will provide free access to the Commit to Kids program at all 57 schools in the Seine River and River East Transcona school divisions.  It provides strategies, policies and a step-by-step plan for reducing the risk of child sexual abuse.  Teachers will also have access to the Kids in the Know program, which is used to help educate students about personal safety strategies that build resilience and reduce their likelihood of victimization. 

	“Through Cybertip.ca, we’re seeing kids as young as eight years old being targeted by adults through livestreaming or gaming apps and websites,” said Signy Arnason, associate executive director, C3P.  “This initiative is about informing parents/teachers on the emerging risks and providing guidance on how to have ongoing, age-appropriate online safety conversations with children.”

	There are more than 20,000 students in both school divisions.  They and their families will receive educational, age-appropriate resources dealing with issues such as cyberbullying, online safety, abuse prevention, exploitation and healthy relationships.  Community organizations will receive posters, cards and other materials to raise public awareness of the issues related to the victimization of children.  All materials are available in English and French.

	Every year, the Manitoba government invests about $15 million in initiatives related to sexual exploitation through Tracia’s Trust, including:
	•    Restoring the Sacred, a culturally based peer mentorship program for Indigenous people aged 14 to 21 who are relocating to Winnipeg to continue their education;
	•    educational opportunities for people with lived experience in sexual exploitation to achieve a post-secondary certificate or diploma in child and youth care;
	•    regional teams located throughout Manitoba to increase public awareness on the issue of sexual exploitation;
	•    specialized placement resources for sexually exploited youth; and
	•    youth shelter resources.

	Through Tracia’s Trust, the province also operates StreetReach, a Winnipeg-based collaborative team that helps identify children and youth at risk of being victimized in the sex trade, and returns them to a place of safety.

	The online campaign led by C3P builds on more than $25 million the government has invested in other recent mental health initiatives that support children and youth, including:
	•    the launch of Granny’s House, a one-year pilot project to provide short-term, culturally safe and community-led care to children and families;
	•    a recruitment of new community helpers;
	•    a collaboration between StreetReach Winnipeg and the Manitoba Adolescent Treatment Centre; and
	•    an expansion of the distribution of Thrival Kits.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT ENHANCES FILM AND VIDEO PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT
					  Incentive to Encourage Private-sector Investment and Attract More Movie Business in Manitoba:  Ministers





	As part of Budget 2020, the Manitoba government plans to enhance the Film and Video Production Tax Credit to encourage private-sector investment in permanent film infrastructure and attract more animation, visual effects (VFX) and post-production companies to relocate or do business in the province, Finance Minister Scott Fielding and Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox announced today.

	“We are pleased to support Manitoba’s successful film production industry and continue to elevate our province’s reputation as a destination for film and video production, and a place where young Manitobans want to build their careers in that industry,” said Fielding.  “This has been a robust year for the film production industry, as demonstrated by the increased demand for the credit to the current in-year forecast amount of $42.5 million from our 2019 budget amount of $31.5 million.”

	In the 2020-21 budget, a new Manitoba Production Company Bonus of eight per cent will be added to the 30 per cent cost-of-production credit, increasing the total cost-of-production credit to 38 per cent.  The ministers noted that improvements are based on advice from the Manitoba Film and Video Production Tax Credit Working Group.

	“With these changes, we hope to see more post-production spending in Manitoba, increased employment opportunities for Manitoba VFX artists, editors and animators, and attract animation post-production and visual effects companies to open new facilities,” said Cox.  “We want to make Manitoba even more competitive with other jurisdictions across the country.” 

	The ministers noted the province continues to build momentum, with the media production industry attracting two companies to open offices in Manitoba.  Urban Prairie Post, a Toronto based post-production and visual effects house, now employs many Manitobans at its new facilities in Winnipeg.  The Cartel opened its Canadian head office in Manitoba and has produced over a dozen ‘movies of the week’ since opening its permanent establishment.  

	“We applaud this announcement as it positions Manitoba at the forefront to capitalize on the global demand for content,” said Rachel Rusen Margolis, CEO and film commissioner, Manitoba Film and Music.  “The enhancement to the all-spend credit incentivizes inward investment to further develop the lucrative VFX, animation and post-production sectors in the province.  The government’s commitment to this industry will result in job creation that will retain local talent and attract new residents to build their careers in media in Manitoba.”

	The ministers said growth in the media production industry may also contribute toward the government’s commitment to create 40,000 private-sector jobs in Manitoba over the next four years.  Manitoba’s thriving film production industry will also benefit from proposed changes to The Highway Traffic Act announced this week that will permit a local traffic authority to authorize certified flag people to control traffic on roads, rather than relying on local law enforcement.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT REMOVES RED TAPE AROUND FILM PRODUCTION TRAFFIC CONTROL
					  Local Traffic Authority Will Permit Use of Certified Flag Persons to Control Traffic:  Ministers


	Manitoba’s thriving film production industry will benefit from proposed changes to The Highway Traffic Act that would give them more flexibility to acquire traffic control services on roads, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler and Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox announced today.

	“These legislative changes will provide more options to organizations that require traffic control services for film productions or special events that use Manitoba roads and ease the demand on law enforcement for traffic control services,” said Schuler.  “Without these legislative changes, organizations may decide to forgo Manitoba as a production location if they face challenges in securing traffic control services.”

	The changes would allow a traffic authority (either the province or municipalities) to permit certified flag people to temporarily control traffic, in situations where it is safe to do so.  Traffic control on Manitoba roads is currently limited to, in case of emergency, police, RCMP and firefighters, and railway companies and contractors performing road maintenance and construction.

	“Our government made a throne speech commitment to boost film and television production in the province, and our growing film and video industry is projected to generate more than $250 million into our economy in 2019-20,” said Cox.  “Demand in rural Manitoba for law enforcement to provide traffic control services for film productions continues to increase, and this proposed amendment will help the film and video industry continue to grow.”

	“Manitoba Film and Music supports the amendment to The Highway Traffic Act which would allow certified flag people to manage traffic flow where appropriate for film shoots,” said Rachel Rusen Margolis, CEO and film commissioner, Manitoba Film and Music.  “This amendment would ultimately result in savings for film productions shooting on provincial highways, providing an additional incentive for off-shore productions who choose Manitoba as a shooting location.”

	“The RCMP in Manitoba has long supported film and television production by providing officers to help direct and control traffic at locations across the province,” said Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy, commanding officer of the Manitoba RCMP.  “This amendment will allow our officers to focus on core policing duties and will help to ensure that we continue to provide the very best in front-line policing services to our communities.”

	Flag people used to control traffic would need a valid flag person certificate from an accredited training provider.  The province provides approval for flag person-training providers in Manitoba.

	“We recognize this is a challenging time for employees and their families, which is why we are putting additional supports in place during this transition,” said Cullen.  “The goal of this transition committee is to help answer questions, identify resources and connect our employees and their families with their next opportunity.”

	The work of this committee extends beyond the agreements in place with the union and other requirements set out under the collective agreement, the minister noted.  The transition committee will:
	•    connect employees with other public service jobs throughout Manitoba, based on their qualifications, interests and preferences;
	•    help family members who are also government employees to find other provincial opportunities in new locations;
	•    find opportunities for retraining or other employment for those who wish to remain in Dauphin and the surrounding region; and
	•    identify other resources available to support employees and their family members.

	The transition committee includes representatives from various government departments, including human resources professionals, and the Dauphin Economic Development HUB, who will help to ensure the group is aware of all opportunities in the region.

	DCC employees have received initial information about the role of the committee, and additional information will be available to employees and Manitobans in the weeks ahead, leading up to the closure of DCC.

PROVINCE PROPOSES AMENDMENTS TO THE CREDIT UNIONS AND CAISSES POPULAIRES ACT
					  Amendments Will Enhance Oversight of  Manitoba's Credit Union Central:  Fielding


	The Manitoba government is proposing amendments to The Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act that would strengthen the regulatory framework for Credit Union Central of Manitoba (CUCM), Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“The financial services sector depends on public trust and confidence, which in turn is dependent on strong oversight and accountability framework,” said Fielding.  “We are working to establish an effective, practical system to oversee Credit Union Central of Manitoba to ensure Manitobans can continue to be confident their savings are safe in our prosperous credit unions and caisses populaires.”

	Fielding noted the federal government withdrew its oversight services of provincial credit union centrals, leaving provincial governments with sole responsibility, so this legislation would fill that gap.

	The proposed legislation would create a framework where:
	•    the Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba (DGCM) will become the primary regulator of Credit Union Central of Manitoba, in addition to its current role as primary regulator of Manitoba’s credit unions and caisses populaires;
	•    the Financial Institutions Regulation Branch of the Manitoba Financial Services Agency (Registrar) will oversee the Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba to ensure it fulfils its regulatory role and maintain responsibility for the system itself; and
	•    the Manitoba government continues to be responsible for the Manitoba Financial Services Agency.

	The minister noted the changes would ensure Manitoba’s regulatory framework meets national and international standards for the effective oversight of deposit-taking institutions, which includes monitoring solvency, liquidity, and safety and soundness.

	As of Dec. 31, 2019, there were 25 credit unions and one caisse populaire in Manitoba, with 199 branch locations and a presence in 124 Manitoba communities.  The sector’s assets were approximately $34.5 billion.  The Deposit Guarantee Corporation of Manitoba provides protection for deposits held with these institutions.

	The minister noted the Manitoba government developed the proposed legislative changes after reviewing other jurisdictions and best practices, and the new framework would resemble the SaskCentral model.

NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) BULLETIN #7


	Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) and public health officials are reminding Manitobans the risk of acquiring the novel (new) coronavirus (COVID-19) in Manitoba remains low.  

	While China remains the epicenter of the outbreak, more countries continue to report COVID-19 cases with local transmissions.  Manitoba officials continue to work closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor the situation as it evolves.

	Travellers returning from Iran and the province of Hubei, contacts of a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 or laboratory workers exposed during work are advised to self-isolate for 14 days after departing from Hubei or Iran, or since their last known contact/exposure.  For information on self-isolation visit www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/factsheets/coronavirus_selfisolation.pdf.

	All returning international travellers should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days after returning to Canada.  As the situation continues to evolve, MHSAL encourages Manitobans to review the Government of Canada’s COVID-19 related travel advisories as they consider their travel plans, which can be found at www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html.

	Travellers who develop cold or flu-like symptoms within 14 days of returning to Canada should contact Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) to determine if testing for COVID-19 should be considered.  In cases where testing is not recommended, they should self-isolate until they are well.

	As of March 5, 97 tests have been completed for COVID-19 in Manitoba.  At this time, there are no laboratory-confirmed cases here.

	Suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 are required to be reported to Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.  Confirmed Canadian cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia.

	Common personal prevention and preparedness measures for viruses such as COVID-19 and influenza include regular hand washing with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  Additional precautions include covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and staying home when you are sick, regardless of recent travel.  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing.  For additional preparedness details visit www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/being-prepared.html.

	Being prepared also means seeking official sources of information to ensure the most up-to-date and accurate information is being used.  MHSAL is also urging media to exercise caution in reporting information related to the evolving COVID-19 situation and to avoid hearsay or speculation, as this can spread misinformation.

	Information on areas with community transmission, as well as links to information on all countries reporting COVID-19 cases, will be updated regularly.  For the most up-to-date information on COVID-19, visit Manitoba Public Health at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/diseases/coronavirus.html.

MANITOBA TO IMPLEMENT FLAT $25-PER-TONNE GREEN LEVY,  PST WILL BE REDUCED TO SIX PER CENT
					  Standing Up for Manitobans:  Pallister


Backgrounder
Background Information

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government will implement a flat $25-per-tonne Green Levy and reduce the PST to six per cent, saving Manitoba families and businesses more than a billion dollars over the next five years compared to the rising federal carbon tax, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	Both the made-in-Manitoba Green Levy and the PST reduction will come into effect on July 1.

	“Unfortunately, the federal government ignored our request to work together as a true partner in tackling climate change, so we have no choice but to act now to protect Manitobans from the rising federal government carbon tax they are bringing in this year,” said Pallister.  “Ottawa has provided special exceptions and exemptions to many other provinces but refused to consider Manitoba’s significant clean hydro investments.”

	Manitobans will come out ahead with both the flat Green Levy and lower PST.  The average Manitoba household will save $200 in 2022 through Manitoba’s flat Green Levy alone, adding up to more than $700 over the next five years, the premier said.

	The premier noted that 100 per cent of the flat Manitoba Green Levy will be returned to Manitobans.  Dropping the PST to six per cent will save Manitobans $325 million each year, $40 million more than the actual cost of the flat Manitoba carbon levy.  The average Manitoba household will save $359 in 2022 with a six per cent PST.

	“Unlike the federal government’s rising carbon tax, our flat made-in-Manitoba Green Levy will return all of the money and more to Manitobans with the second-lowest PST in Canada,” said Pallister.

	Manitoba large industrial emitters will reduce emissions through a made-in-Manitoba output-based carbon pricing system based on the flat Green Levy of $25 per tonne.

	Greenhouse-gas emissions in Manitoba will be reduced by at least two megatonnes (MT) over the five-year carbon savings account period set in legislation, a doubling of the original one MT goal fixed last June.

	“Manitobans know tackling climate change is important and we are already doing our part by investing billions in clean, green hydro,” said Pallister.  “Together with the our hydro investments, the highest clean fuel standards in the country announced in January, plus additional measures we are taking, Manitoba’s carbon emissions will be reduced by more than any previous government.  Our plan is better for the environment, better for the economy, and better for children and grandchildren.”

	Manitoba is taking strong action on climate change and implementing a flat Green Levy to replace the federal backstop carbon tax, Pallister added.

	“Manitoba has offered to be a bridge between east and west on climate and carbon and that offer still stands,” said Pallister.  “Working with us should not be a bridge too far for the federal government.”

	The Manitoba government has introduced legislation that would allow testing of automated vehicles on provincial roads, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“Development of vehicle technology, including automated self-driving vehicles, is progressing rapidly worldwide and these changes will help make Manitoba competitive in attracting business and keeping pace with other jurisdictions,” said Schuler.  “Our government is honouring our commitment to bring forward legislative amendments that would create a framework to allow the safe testing of automated vehicles on Manitoba roads.”

	The Vehicle Technology Testing Act (Various Acts Amended) would create a framework to enable testing of vehicle technology and types including automated and connected.  Testing advanced and alternative vehicle technologies would also position the province as an attractive location for companies to test intelligent transportation infrastructure.

	Before the province can authorize testing, it would develop regulations and a permitting system this year, in consultation with stakeholders, the minister noted.

	“By enabling developers to safely test emerging vehicle technologies on provincial roadways, we are supporting Manitoba’s large agricultural, trucking, heavy vehicle manufacturing and technology development sectors,” said Schuler.  “Numerous vehicle technologies are in development and ready for testing, creating opportunities for Manitoba-based business.”

	The bill also amends The Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) Corporation Act and The Insurance Act concerning registration and insurance requirements for vehicle testing organizations.

					  Our Commitments are Clear and Ambitious - to Move Manitoba Forward to Greater Stability, Prosperity and Opportunity for All Manitobans:  Pallister


	As the spring legislative session begins and in advance of Budget 2020, the Manitoba government is issuing mandate letters to all ministers outlining the government’s ambitious agenda to build a better, brighter future for all Manitobans and their families, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“We are a government that keeps its word.  Our commitments are clear and ambitious – to move Manitoba forward by providing better services, protecting our environment, making our communities stronger and safer, and making life more affordable for all Manitobans”, said Pallister.  “Manitoba became the most improved province in Canada in our first term which has provided a strong foundation as we move Manitoba forward to greater stability, prosperity and opportunity.  Budget 2020 will focus on the issues that matter most to Manitobans.”

	The Manitoba government will work as a team to honour its commitment to Manitobans to achieve the five-point guarantee Moving Manitoba Forward that will see further tax relief, better health care sooner, more schools for students, more jobs for Manitobans, and made-in-Manitoba climate-change solutions, the premier noted.  

	The mandate letters further support the government’s ongoing commitment to be transparent and accountable to Manitobans.  Highlights of the mandate letters include:
	•    ensuring Budget 2020 has sufficient resiliency to help protect Manitobans from the effects of possible flooding and other emergencies;
	•    stabilizing the capital funding baskets to allow urban and rural municipalities to plan better;
	•    working with other levels of government to explore the feasibility of utilizing a P3 delivery model and the Canada Infrastructure Bank to finance and deliver the necessary upgrades to the City of Winnipeg’s North End Water Pollution Control Centre;
	•    championing Manitoba as an ideal location for business investment and expansion and capture new opportunities through a renewed trade strategy;
	•    developing partnerships with Indigenous communities to develop natural resources and economic infrastructure;
	•    growing the highways budget by 14 per cent to $400 million from $350 million over the next four years;
	•    advancing the redevelopment of the St. Boniface Emergency Department to strengthen Winnipeg’s emergency health services;
	•    continuing to advocate for a strengthened partnership with the federal government on funding health care;
	•    enhancing public safety and continuing the modernization of the criminal justice system;
	•    creating a $25-million Teachers’ Idea Fund to support front-line educators who propose innovative projects that improve literacy and numeracy outcomes;
	•    transforming the Employment Income Assistance (EIA) Program to a benefit that provides a short-term bridge to meaningful employment from one that encourages dependency on government;
	•    developing a new Portable Child-Care Benefit that will help lower-income families find child care;
	•    developing of a provincial trail network and enhancing recycling, composting and waste management systems;
	•    implementing on-line licensing for outdoor enthusiasts including hunters, trappers, anglers and park visitors; and
	•    enhancing the film tax credit to encourage more permanent investments in film production.

	“Our government has established Ideas Funds across all departments to encourage front-line workers to come forward with innovative ideas to modernize and improve the way we deliver the services Manitobans depend on,” said Pallister.  “We will build a better, more efficient, responsible and open government that provides quality services to all Manitobans.”

	Mandate letters for legislative assistants, the special envoy for military affairs and Crown corporations will be issued at a later date, the premier added.

	The Manitoba legislature resumes today and Budget 2020 will be delivered on March 11.  Over 20 bills are expected to be introduced during the spring session, on top of the 20 bills already introduced last fall.

	As part of its upcoming Budget 2020, the Manitoba government is creating greater accountability and cleaning up special funds set up by the previous government, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“As part of our plans to make Manitoba’s budgeting process more open and transparent, we discovered the previous government was collecting money from Manitobans into fake funds, yet the fees paid were not fully being used for their intended purpose,” said Fielding.  “Funds were used to understate the size of the previous government’s deficits, making them look even smaller than they actually were.  Our government’s accounting methods must be truthful and accountable to Manitobans and that is why Budget 2020 is cleaning up the mess created by these special funds.”

	As an example, Fielding mentioned the Trucking Productivity Improvement Fund, which collected fees from companies who are using trucks to carry overweight and oversized loads under the guise the fees would be used to fix wear and tear on highways caused by heavy truck traffic.  However, the fees collected were put into general revenue.

	Budget 2020 will allocate $600,000 in Manitoba Infrastructure revenue and expenditure to reflect the collected permit fees from companies and the corresponding expense to maintain provincial highways that are included in the program.  

	To clear the outstanding balance in the Trucking Productivity Improvement Fund, Manitoba Infrastructure will make a one-time, $5-million investment in road preservation and maintenance in 2020-21.

	The following special funds are in the process of being remediated to ensure those expecting benefits from the funds can rely on the money will be spent for its designated purposes:
	•    Abandonment Reserve Account,
	•    Mine Rehabilitation Reserve,
	•    Fisheries and Wildlife Enhancement Fund,
	•    Quarry Rehabilitation Reserve Account,
	•    Veterinary Sciences Scholarship Fund,
	•    Farm Machinery and Equipment Fund,
	•    Manitoba Opportunities Fund,
	•    Community Revitalization Fund,
	•    Victim’s Assistance Fund,
	•    Legal Aid,
	•    Borrowers Financial Literacy Fund,
	•    Land Titles Assurance Fund,
	•    Workplace Safety and Public Education Fund,
	•    Housing Development and Rehabilitation Fund,
	•    Fire Prevention Fund,
	•    Trucking Productivity Improvement Fund, and
	•    Waste Reduction and Recycling Support Fund.

	“There was no one-size-fits-all fix to these special funds, and care was taken on each fund to find a way to protect the stakeholders whose money went into it and ensure money is set aside for them,” said Fielding.  “We will take further legislative measures as required later this year.  In the weeks ahead, Manitobans will learn other steps we are taking to make our provincial budget process more transparent and consistent, and apply the same rules to central government and dozens of other reporting entities.”

	This year, departments will receive sufficient funds to use for their original, intended purposes and to ensure this money is spent.  Going forward, departmental budgets will be increased by an amount equal to the revenues generated by the fees, to be spent on their intended purposes by the end of fiscal year, the minister said, adding these amounts will be part of base budgets in future years.

	The provincial budget will be released March 11.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT RELEASES THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL UPDATE
					  Province Slightly Ahead of Schedule to Balance Budget:  Fielding


	The Manitoba government released its third quarter report for the 2019-20 fiscal year, which indicates the province is on the right track to financial recovery in uncertain economic times, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“Manitoba is showing continued progress toward balancing the budget and steadily reducing the deficit,” said Fielding.  “The third quarter report provides a clear picture of the fiscal year and is indicating revenues are higher than anticipated due to our resilient economy.”

	At this point, the deficit is projected to be $325 million, about $35 million ahead of the government’s target.  The province remains ahead of schedule to eliminate the deficit.

	Revenue is up $248 million compared to budget projections, mainly related to an increase in income taxes.  Expenses are also up $118 million compared to budget projections, as the forecast includes over $150 million for new green initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in debt-servicing costs.

	Fielding noted the report proves the province is delivering on the infrastructure promises made as part of Budget 2019, which committed at least $1 billion in strategic infrastructure spending on priorities such as roads and bridges, flood protection, hospitals, schools, universities and colleges.  The third quarter report forecasts $1,227 million on infrastructure spending.

	The minister noted the province continues to ensure value for money on procurement and has centralized many capital delivery functions to create efficiencies.

MANITOBA ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY SAFETY STRATEGY,  RESTORATIVE JUSTICE INITIATIVE IN THOMPSON


	THOMPSON—The Manitoba government is providing new support for a community-led safety strategy and strengthening partnerships to increase the use of restorative justice in northern Manitoba, Justice Minister Cliff Cullen announced today.

	“Building a safer, stronger and more resilient community must be done in partnership with the people who live and work there,” said Cullen.  “We are pleased to invest in the development of a community safety strategy, led by the City of Thompson, with input from community members, Indigenous partners and stakeholders.  By working together, we can make a real difference in the safety and wellness of citizens while advancing reconciliation in Manitoba.”

	The province is providing a $35,000 grant for the City of Thompson to work with a consultant and develop a community safety and well-being strategy.  The goal is to create a tool that identifies risks and social factors that contribute to crime and victimization, identify initiatives to address these factors and set measurable outcomes.  

	“The team we’ve assembled has already been working to improve public safety and well-being in Thompson for many years, and all have a detailed understanding of Thompson’s realities, challenges and opportunities,” said Mayor Colleen Smook, City of Thompson.  “We’re excited to bring these perspectives together under a broader strategy for the benefit of Thompson and the region as a whole.”

	To help improve timely access to justice in the north, the Manitoba government has launched Restorative Justice North in partnership with the Manitoba Metis Federation (MMF) and Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO).  This pilot project brings restorative justice partners together to assess and divert matters into appropriate programs and resolve them in a more timely way.

	The minister noted the goal of Restorative Justice North is to increase the use of diversion options in Thompson. Accordingly, MKO will also develop a complementary restorative justice program for Thompson, based on their existing expertise in restorative justice.

	“MKO is hopeful that this announcement and initial investments are the beginning of utilizing culturally appropriate and Indigenous ways of being to address justice issues in the north,” said Grand Chief Garrison Settee, MKO.  “Criminal offences stem from systemic causes that require more in-depth and holistic approaches that focuses on the victim, offender and the community at large.  Without holistic approaches to address justice, the cycle continues without any benefit to the community.  Restorative justice is a step forward in addressing the impacts of colonialism.  The approach must be Indigenous led with First Nations, Inuit and Métis at the table and inputting into the design, having decision making authority and implementing from a culturally appropriate lens.”

	The Manitoba government is investing more than $2.8 million in restorative justice programs this year, an increase of $400,000 over the previous fiscal year.  This increase includes additional investments of $50,000 with both MMF and MKO.  

	The minister noted he looks forward to ongoing collaboration with the City of Thompson, MKO, MMF and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC) on these important issues.  

	“On behalf of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, I congratulate all parties involved in the restorative justice and safety pilot project for the City of Thompson,” said Grand Chief Arlen Dumas, AMC.  “The AMC supports any Manitoba Justice initiative intended to reduce the incarceration rates of our citizens in the Thompson area and elsewhere.  It is my hope that restorative justice grounded in First Nations principles will also help to reduce recidivism, support offenders, and offer alternatives, particularly for the First Nations youth in the Thompson area.”

	Every year, more than 5,000 matters are diverted out of the criminal justice system to be resolved through restorative justice and diversion programs.  Restorative justice and diversion programs have proved beneficial for addressing systemic roots causes that lead to criminal activity and create an opportunity for the offender to make amends to the victim and the community, and help reduce the likelihood of future contact with the legal system.  Individuals who participate before charges are laid can avoid the stigma of a criminal charge.

	The minister noted funding allocated for the City of Thompson’s strategy builds on $300,000 previously allocated by the province to support community safety initiatives.  This commitment was set out in the May 2019 Policing and Public Safety Strategy.  For more information, visit: www.gov.mb.ca/justice/pubs/police_publicsafety_strategy.pdf.

TRANSMISSION LINE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS AND CREATE MORE RELIABLE POWER SUPPLY


	Investing in green infrastructure is critical to protecting the environment, improving people’s lives and creating sustainable economic growth.

	Today, the Honourable Jim Carr, the prime minister’s special advisor for the Prairies, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, minister of infrastructure and communities, Central Services Minister Reg Helwer and Jay Grewal, president and CEO of Manitoba Hydro, announced funding for the Birtle Transmission Line linking Saskatchewan to Manitoba’s green, renewable energy.

	This project will help Manitoba Hydro build a 230-kilovolt transmission line from Birtle South Station in the Municipality of Prairie View to the Manitoba–Saskatchewan border 46 kilometres northwest. Once completed, the new line will allow up to 215 megawatts of renewable hydroelectricity, which is currently surplus to the needs of Manitobans, to flow from the Manitoba Hydro power grid to the SaskPower power grid.

	Increasing Manitoba’s interconnection to Western Canada’s power distribution grid will establish greater stability for energy supply, while keeping energy rates affordable for the province. Manitoba’s clean hydroelectricity is a vital element of Saskatchewan’s efforts to reduce cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions in that province.

	The Government of Canada is investing more than $18.7 million, and the government of Manitoba is contributing more than $42 million, in this project through the Green Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada Plan.

PROVINCE IMPLEMENTING WILDFIRE PREVENTION MEASURES
					  Protecting Front-Line Staff from Exposure to COVID-19


	Manitoba Climate and Conservation advises the current risk of wildfire is generally low across the province, with a significant amount of snow still on the ground in northern Manitoba. Human-caused wildfires, primarily grass fires, have been reported in the south. In order to reduce the risk of fire and the risk of exposure to COVID-19 for front-line firefighters, the province is asking the public to be particularly cautious when outdoors to prevent human-caused wildfires. Protecting front-line firefighters and support staff during the COVID-19 pandemic is a top priority to ensure they remain healthy and available to respond to wildfires during the upcoming season.

	In light of current events and as a wildfire prevention measure, provincial burn permits issued under The Wildfires Act within the burning permit area will be limited to only essential crop residue burning and other required agricultural, municipal or industrial operations. Burning within the burning permit area requires the approval of an officer and may include a site inspection. Contact a Manitoba Conservation and Climate office for more information. The latest information on municipal and provincial burn restrictions can be found at www.manitoba.ca/wildfire.

	All applicable provincial and municipal burning approval processes must be followed before burning. Provincial burn permit holders must comply with Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development’s guidance on crop residue burning and their municipality’s burning permit conditions, where applicable. Daily guidance for crop residue burning will be posted by 11 a.m. at www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/crop-residue-burning-program/index.html.

	Where there is a conflict, consult with a local Manitoba Conservation and Climate office or municipal authority for clarification. Provincial burn permits will not be issued for areas where municipalities have already implemented burning restrictions. 

	Burn permit holders are reminded to check weather conditions, have adequate suppression equipment and ensure proper fuel breaks are in place before burning. Never leave an outdoor fire unattended and always extinguish it before leaving. 

	Anyone using an ATV should stay on developed trails, stop frequently to check areas around the engine and exhaust for debris, and carefully dispose of any debris caught in equipment. A small shovel, axe, and fire extinguisher should be carried on ATVs at all times. 

	To report a wildfire, call 911 or the T.I.P. line (toll-free) at 1-800-782-0076.

	Public health officials advise two new cases of COVID-19 have been identified as of 9:30 a.m. today, bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 275.

	The data also shows:
	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized, with no individuals in intensive care;
	•    49 active cases and 220 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.

	As of yesterday, an additional 424 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 24,723.

	Public Health orders restricting staff from working in more than one licensed personal care home (PCH) have been signed and will take effect May 1. The single-site restriction is intended to provide additional protection against the introduction and/or spread of the COVID-19 virus within PCHs.

	In recognition of the vulnerability of the PCH population to severe illness and/or death related to the virus, provincial planning has been underway to ensure the change is able to be implemented quickly while ensuring stable staffing and service continuity. Of the 127 licensed PCHs in Manitoba, 121 have confirmed readiness, with work ongoing to address staffing issues at the remaining sites by the weekend.

	It is important to note that while some gradual lifting or restrictions has begun, significant work to limit the spread of COVID-19 must continue. Public health is also advising people to remain within or close to their home communities. The request to stay home as much as possible is still in place at this time. This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only. Visits to cottages are not recommended at this time. Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

	A new drive-thru community testing site will open Friday in Swan River, at the Manitoba Public Insurance facility, 125 Fourth Ave. North. Hours of operation will be daily from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. This is Manitoba’s 16th community testing site and ninth drive-thru location.

	For up-to-date information on testing criteria and community screening sites, visit www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html. For more information and to access the online screening tool for COVID-19, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

MANITOBA PARTNERS WITH TELUS TO KEEP CHILDREN IN CARE CONNECTED WITH FAMILY, SCHOOL SUPPORTS


Backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government applauds TELUS for donating tablets and data plans to help ensure children coming into care can stay connected with family members and other important supports during the COVID-19 pandemic, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“Re-establishing a connection with safe and trusted family members is incredibly important for children who must come into care, and this has become an even greater challenge as we are all social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19,” said Stefanson. “Through our partnership with TELUS, children will be able to text or video chat with family and other loved ones, stay on top of school assignments and remain connected. Together, we are supporting vulnerable youth so they can continue to feel connected to family members, elders and siblings during this difficult time.”

	TELUS has donated more than 120 tablets with data plans to the province. The majority will go to emergency placement shelters operated by Winnipeg Child and Family Services (CFS), which are used until arrangements that are more permanent can be made for children coming into care and to provide a safe place for youth who may be in safe havens or group care settings. Some of the tablets will go to small operators who provide services to at-risk youth. The tablets will help children to quickly reconnect with family members, friends, teachers and other supports, creating stability during this challenging time, the minister noted.

	“TELUS is deeply committed to keeping Manitobans safe and connected during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the province’s most at-risk and vulnerable citizens,” said Tim Prokipchuk, director of sales, TELUS. “This public health crisis has reminded us all of the importance of human connection, and it is a privilege for our team to be able to provide access to the devices and service needed for children to stay in touch with loved ones, educators and vital support services.”

	Eighty-five tablets will be used by Winnipeg CFS. The remaining tablets will be distributed to community partners that also provide emergency as well as longer-term placements and supports for vulnerable children from across the province including:
	•    Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre (11 tablets);
	•    Neecheewam (seven);
	•    Ndinawemaaganag Endaawaad (six);
	•    Blue Thunderbird Family Care (five);
	•    Roots Youth Care (four);
	•    Reach Youth Services (three); and
	•    Jessie Home (two).

	“These are indeed trying times, especially for children and youth in care,” said Karl Gompf, acting executive director, Jessie Home. “The TELUS donation is coming at a crucial time and is like a breath of fresh air. Keeping in touch with family and friends and enhanced contact with teachers is so essential for the positive mental health of our young people. From the staff and residents, virtual hugs.”

	The minister noted this partnership builds on the Manitoba Protection Plan, a series of government-wide initiatives to support Manitobans through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Watch news conference





	Public health officials advise one new case of COVID-19 has been identified as of 9:30 a.m. today, bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 273.

	The data also shows:
	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized, with no individuals in intensive care;
	•    54 active cases and 213 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.

	As of yesterday, an additional 448 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 24,304.

	Today, health officials released information about the models developed in Manitoba to inform the management plan for the COVID-19 pandemic in Manitoba. A model for the spread of COVID-19 was created, using data and information available in the scientific literature from other jurisdictions and with input from experts in Manitoba.  
	 
	Officials noted that modelling results are always an abstraction and cannot project all possible outcomes. Outbreaks also evolve and change over time as public health measures are put in place and people’s behaviour changes. Therefore, these projections must be constantly revised. As new information is received, officials will continue to refine the projections, models and health advice for Manitobans.
	 
	Current models show that:
	•    under routine public health measures, which include case interviews and contact tracing but which do not include social and physical distancing or travel restrictions, modeling suggests Manitoba would have had 933 cases by April 25. If that trend had continued, there would have been more than 2,000 cases by mid-May. However, the number of cases on April 25 was 267.
	•    under current public health measures, Manitoba could expect approximately 6,250 cases if the current measures remain in place for a year.
	•    the Manitoba health-care system has 2,432 acute care medical and surgical hospital beds. As of April 26, 977 of these beds were currently vacant and available for COVID-19 patients, a 40 per cent vacancy rate. This shows Manitoba is well within hospital capacity at this time.
	•    the Manitoba health-care system has 86 adult intensive care hospital beds. As of April 22, 29 of these beds were vacant and available for COVID-19 patients, a 34 per cent vacancy rate. This shows Manitoba is well within intensive care capacity at this time.
	 
	This data supports the easing of public health measures, as announced earlier today. Officials also noted that planning is underway to add an additional 300 beds and an additional 100 intensive care beds for COVID-19 patients, if needed. Additional capacity options are being investigated if they are necessary.

PREMIER UNVEILS MANITOBA'S ROADMAP TO EXPANDING SERVICES SAFELY
					  Manitoba to Begin Easing Restrictions on Businesses; Physical Distancing Measures Still in Effect: Premier

Watch news conference





	Manitoba will begin a careful, multi-phased effort next week to gradually restore services, open some businesses and increase recreational opportunities while maintaining social distancing advice, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“We applaud Manitobans for doing their part to help flatten the curve and it is thanks to everyone’s tremendous efforts that we are able to announce today a gradual, safe restoration of services and easing of restrictions on businesses, allowing many to reopen, should they so choose,” Pallister said. “We must remain diligent in maintaining physical distancing and practising good hygiene, but our gradual, leveled approach will help us safely restore our services.”

	As of May 4, a variety of non-essential health-care and retail businesses will have the option to reopen under strict guidelines. All businesses and venues will be required to continue following social distancing and stringent cleaning practices to protect both employees and customers.

	Size restrictions of public and private gatherings of no more than 10 people will remain in place. Everyone is expected to continue to follow social distancing rules at all times and to stay home if they are sick. Travel restrictions will remain in place such as avoiding all non-essential travel outside of Manitoba, and requirements for self-isolation for 14 days following travel will continue.

	Based on the evolving global public health recommendations and modelling, Manitoba is in a position to begin a methodical, phased-in approach to reopening businesses, said Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer.

	“Our public health measures to date have helped us reduce case numbers and flatten the curve, but it is not practical to maintain these measures indefinitely,” said Roussin. “That is why we will gradually reduce these measures including balancing the need to protect vulnerable Manitobans from COVID-19 with the need to protect Manitobans from the unintended impacts of strict public health measures, which include health and social impacts.”

Phased Approach to Restoring Services

Restoring Safe Services:  Manitoba’s Pandemic Economic Recovery Roadmap consists of multiple phases. It is critical to note the timing and specifics noted in each phase are subject to change, based on the advice of public health experts and a continuous assessment of transmission patterns and other factors.

	Full details are available at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices.

Restoring Services (Phase One) – Beginning May 4

	Critical public health measures and travel restrictions remain. Priority elective surgeries have been restarted, diagnostics screening will resume and some non-essential businesses will reopen but must limit occupancy to 50 per cent of normal business levels or one person per 10 square metres, whichever is lower. Services, businesses and venues include:
	•    non-urgent surgery and diagnostic procedures;
	•    therapeutic and medical services;
	•    retail businesses;
	•    restaurants – patio/walk-up services;
	•    hair salons;
	•    museums, galleries and libraries;
	•    seasonal day camps; and
	•    outdoor recreation and campgrounds.

	The province will continually re-evaluate and adjust plans for further easing of secondary public health measures and may reintroduce others.

Restoring Services (Phase Two) – No Earlier Than June 1

	Critical public health measures and travel restrictions may remain in place. Public gathering sizes may be increased and more non-essential businesses will be considered for reopening including:
	•    additional personal services, such as nail salons;
	•    restaurants – dine-in services;
	•    non-contact children’s sports; and
	•    film production.

Future Phases

	Public health measures may be eased further. Additional guidelines will be developed, public gathering sizes will be increased and some non-essential business will fully open. Others may begin to reopen, such as bars, pools and spas, movie theatres and indoor recreational facilities. Travel restrictions may be eased.

	Specific considerations for other businesses and sectors may be made including:
	•    performing arts venues;
	•    other non-essential businesses;
	•    tattoo parlours, estheticians, cosmetologists and tanning studios; and
	•    large gatherings/events.

	Mass gatherings such as concerts, summer festivals and major sporting events will not be considered before September 2020, Roussin noted.

	Child care plays an important role in restoring services, enabling parents to return to the workplace, and remains a priority. The Department of Families will continue to work with the child-care community to expand the temporary child-care services available, including a grant available to child-care providers seeking to open a new, home-based child-care service.

PROVINCE IMPLEMENTS NEW TEMPORARY ORDERS UNDER THE EMERGENCY MEASURES ACT
					  Orders Support Manitobans' Well-being and Livelihoods: Pallister


	The Manitoba government is implementing four new temporary orders under The Emergency Measures Act to protect vulnerable Manitobans, to help the economy, and to ensure the flow of goods and supplies into and out of Manitoba, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“The health and safety of all Manitobans, especially those most vulnerable, is our number one priority as we fight COVID-19 and navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic,” said Pallister. “Our government is listening and acting on the concerns brought forward by our partners in various areas, such as social services, post-secondary education and the transportation industry. We are suspending certain statutory requirements and extending deadlines with the well-being of Manitobans in mind.”

	The province is implementing four orders, retroactive to the beginning of the state of emergency March 20:
	•    Youth in Care Provisions Order,
	•    Student Aid Provisions Order,
	•    International Fuel Tax Agreement Credential Provisions Order, and
	•    Trucking and Transportation Provisions Order.

	“We’re making responsible, common sense adjustments because it’s the right thing to do in this time of crisis,” said Pallister. “Youth in the care of Manitoba Child and Family Services (CFS) will continue to be supported, even if they age out of the system during this state of emergency. Post-secondary students and graduates won’t have to stress about losing eligibility for student aid or repaying loans during this time.

	“We’re also taking steps to extend permits and to safely reduce some regulatory requirements for truck drivers and commercial vehicle operators to ensure they can stay on the road and continue the movement of essential goods and supplies.”

	Under the Youth in Care Provisions Order, youth in the CFS system who turn 18 during this period must continue to be offered ongoing supports. This extension also applies to young adults who have chosen to sign a voluntary agreement to continue to receive assistance as they transition to independence, which would allow them to remain eligible beyond age 21.   

	The Student Aid Provisions Order allows post-secondary students to remain eligible for aid, even if they temporarily stop qualifying during the state of emergency period. The provision lowers the minimum monthly repayment to $0 from $25, suspends the obligation for a student to start paying back their loan eight months after they end their studies, prevents borrowers from going into default during the state of emergency period and extends the maximum term for repayment. Those with existing loans are not obligated to pay back their loan for six months beginning March 30.

	The International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) Credential Provisions Order suspends the requirement that a carrier licensed under the agreement must have and display credentials, and the province will not fine licensed carriers if their licensing authority was unable to distribute their credentials.

	The province previously provided relief to carriers who do not have an IFTA licence in The Fuel Tax Amendment and Retail Sales Tax Amendment Act. The requirement to obtain a single-trip permit for each truck entering Manitoba was suspended for the duration of the state of emergency.

	The Trucking and Transportation Provisions Order is extending the expiry dates on certain permits, certificates or registrations until July 31. This includes qualifying vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan (IRP), the vehicle registration system for trucks and buses operating inter-jurisdictionally between Manitoba and other provinces or states throughout North America. Deadlines to pay IRP registration renewal charges are also extended. The order also extends the period between required inspections on vehicles such as buses and commercial carriers, extends annual overweight or over-dimensional vehicle permits, and extends safety fitness certificates for commercial carriers. The order will also provide a temporary exemption from the need for single-trip permits for increased vehicle weights and for commercial vehicles from other jurisdictions.

	The regular three-month deadline for new residents and non-residents to replace their out-of-province driving permits with a Manitoba driver’s licence, vehicle registration or insurance is also extended to July 31 (or three months after they enter the province, whichever time period is longer).

	The province has the ability to revoke any of the above orders sooner than stated above if it deems necessary.

PROVINCE INCREASES COVID-19 TESTING CRITERIA AND CAPACITY
					  A Crucial Step in the Process to Restart the Economy:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	The province is expanding COVID-19 testing criteria while also ramping up its testing capacity, a crucial step before beginning to loosen public health measures and safely restarting Manitoba’s economy, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Through good planning, Manitoba has been able to get ahead of COVID-19 and flatten the curve,” said Pallister. “We want to stay ahead of this virus and not chase it. With increased levels of tracking, testing and isolation, we will have a better understanding of how we are doing as a province in flattening the COVID curve. This is crucial as we carefully and slowly work toward expanding services safely in the coming weeks and months.”

	Effective immediately, the province is expanding testing criteria to any Manitoban with symptoms of COVID-19, even mild symptoms including a cough, runny nose, sore throat and/or fever, to be tested to better determine the spread of the virus in Manitoba, the premier noted.

	In order to facilitate enhanced testing provincewide, Dynacare will begin significantly increasing COVID-19 testing alongside Manitoba’s primary public health lab, Cadham Provincial Lab (CPL).

	Dynacare has been performing COVID-19 tests since early April out of its Ontario-based laboratory to supplement the capacity of CPL and, as of April 27, has completed 557 tests. The Manitoba government and Dynacare have entered into a partnership that will see up to 2,000 tests a day before the end of summer.

	With CPL’s capacity at over 1,000 tests daily, the province expects to have testing capacity of well over 3,000 tests a day, tripling the provinces current testing capacity, the premier noted. In addition, Dynacare will work toward establishing a second COVID testing lab in Winnipeg, assisting the province with faster processing times.

	Shared Health’s diagnostic services is also supporting the province’s enhanced testing capacity, performing some COVID-19 testing for patients at HSC Winnipeg prior to surgery and producing quantities of the viral medium needed to transport testing swabs to laboratories. 

	In addition to testing, Dynacare call centre staff have been communicating negative test results to Manitobans and delivering COVID-19 test specimens from screening and assessment centres to CPL. They have also established specimen collection centres for patients with compromised immune systems.
	 
	Manitobans are reminded that if they are showing symptoms of COVID-19 and meet testing criteria, they can call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 for more information.

STATEMENT FROM PREMIER BRIAN PALLISTER ON NATIONAL DAY OF MOURNING


	Manitoba is joining with jurisdictions across Canada in proclaiming April 28 as a National Day of Mourning and observing a minute of silence at 11 a.m. for workers and their families who have been affected by workplace injury and illness.

	Today, we pause to remember and honour those who died of work-related causes and those whose lives have been forever impacted by injury and illness.

	In 2019, 19 Manitobans died as a result of occupational illness and acute hazards. They are mourned by their families, friends and coworkers.

	As we remember them, we are renewing our commitment to keep Manitoban safe and healthy in the workplace.

	We will continue to work together with employers and other partners toward our common goal of bringing Manitobans home safe from work each and every day.

	While we cannot remember these workers in person today due to COVID-19 restrictions, virtual events are being held in Winnipeg to commemorate and honour them. The flags at the main entrance of the Legislative Building have been lowered today to mark this important day of reflection and action.

	More than ever, we need to be mindful of safety and health on the job. I want to recognize Manitoba’s front-line health-care workers who show courage and dedication in fighting COVID-19 every day. I encourage all Manitobans to take a moment of reflection today.

	Manitoba is joining more than 80 countries around the world to observe this day of mourning.

PROVINCE INTRODUCES CHANGES TO MANITOBA BIRTH CERTIFICATES


	The Manitoba government has introduced policy changes to create more inclusive birth certificates, Finance Minister Scott Fielding announced today.

	“In response to a ruling from the Manitoba Human Rights Commission, the Vital Statistics Agency is implementing policy changes to be more inclusive to Manitobans,” Fielding said.

	The changes will allow individuals to select a non-binary option, in addition to male or female, when applying for a change of sex designation under The Vital Statistics Act.

	The Vital Statistics Agency has updated its policy and forms to comply with this change.  

	In a November 2019 decision, the Manitoba Human Rights Commission (MHRC) required the province to recognize and implement policies to allow for non-binary sex designations by May 2, 2020. The policy change ensures Manitoba complies with the MHRC ruling.

	The Manitoba government has taken the additional step of introducing a legislative change that would remove the requirement to display sex designation on birth and death certificates. The minister noted this legislation has not yet passed, as the opposition has refused to let the bill proceed to second reading.

	Updated information for Manitobans is available at www.vitalstats.gov.mb.ca.

GOVERNMENTS OF CANADA AND MANITOBA ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR LOCAL FOOD PRODUCERS AND FARMERS' MARKETS
					  Developing New Marketing Options Will Strengthen Distribution Network


	The governments of Canada and Manitoba will be supporting a project, which will allow local food producers and farmers’ markets to sell their products online, federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Blaine Pedersen announced today.

	“Farmers and food processors across the agri-food value chain are working hard to make sure Canadians continue to have access to their high quality and affordable food. Our government, along with of our provincial counterparts, is working step by step to support our producers as they provide an essential service to all Canadians,” said Bibeau. “By creating a centralized online platform for Manitoban producers to sell their products, we are increasing flexibility in the supply chain during a very challenging time.”

	“Increasing access to Manitoba’s diverse selection of foods grown or processed in the province will build resiliency in our food system and proactively address concerns about food insecurity,” said Pedersen. “Developing new marketing options at a time when important outlets such as restaurants, retail and farmers’ markets are disrupted will help strengthen distribution of local food to Manitoba customers.”

	Canada and Manitoba will be providing a total of $160,000 through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership to Direct Farm Manitoba to purchase a software platform that will allow Manitobans to order food online from local producers and farmers’ markets. The funding will also go toward the development of a network of pickup and delivery options to connect consumers with their orders, and the development of COVID-19 safe handling and packaging practices for producers and processors.

	“Canadians have always been able to count on farmers for good, healthy food. It has never been more important for our food supply to be reliable and diverse,” said Phil Veldhuis, president, Direct Farm Manitoba. “We have been working hard to connect consumers directly to local farmers. We appreciate this investment to reinforce our local food system at this time of crisis.”

	The five-year, $3-billion Canadian Agricultural Partnership includes $2 billion for cost-shared strategic initiatives delivered by the provinces and territories and $1 billion for federal programs and services. For more information, visit www.canada.ca/Agri-Partnership.

PROVINCE FINALIZING ADDITIONAL CARE OPTIONS TO ENSURE CONTINUED ACCESS TO CARE DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC


backgrounder
Background Information


	The Manitoba government is working with physicians to ensure Manitobans can access care virtually as part of the province’s broader plan for delivering medical services during the pandemic response, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today. 

	 

	“During the pandemic and time of physical distancing, our government is taking action to meet the ongoing needs of Manitobans for health-care services,” said Friesen. “As conventional ways of seeing a doctor are disrupted because of COVID-19, our government continues to act to find innovative ways to enable Manitobans to access family physicians and specialists by telephone or video conference to supplement traditional models of care.”

	 

	In March, the Manitoba government was one of the first provinces to develop time-limited virtual options for primary care visits and psychotherapy care provided by psychiatrists. This has been effective in helping patients receive clinical care without a physical trip to a doctor’s office while also reducing the utilization of personal protective equipment.

	 

	Today, in collaboration with medical leadership and Doctors Manitoba, the Manitoba government has added further time-limited tariffs for additional virtual services, including virtual primary care visits for residents of personal care homes who need routine care for chronic illnesses, ensuring they receive the care they need during the pandemic. 

	 

	These new clinical options for patients have been developed to address the significant drop in patient visits to a physician since the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Manitoba. It is expected that these new tariffs will permit physicians to continue to shift their clinical interactions with patients from in-person to a virtual setting. Use of these new tariffs will only be permitted when a virtual appointment is appropriate and demonstrates equal clinical-value to an in-person interaction between a physician and patient. 

	 

	“These new options will make it easier for physicians to provide care virtually during the pandemic, which is especially important in personal care homes,” said Dr. Jose Francois, provincial specialty lead in family medicine, Shared Health. “This will ensure physicians are able to provide continued quality care to vulnerable residents, helping them maintain their health while keeping them safe.”

	 

	The minister noted the province has already made a $4.5-million investment in virtual therapy resources to support the needs of Manitobans during the pandemic. The AbilitiCBT program is a free and confidential virtual-therapy platform and has proven to be one of the most effective and efficient therapy methods available. In addition to this work, the province is introducing support for services by telephone or video to enable family physicians and specialists to help their patients Manitobans manage their mental health without having to leave home. Physicians will first direct patients seeking support for anxiety related to the pandemic to these on-line cognitive behavioural therapy resources unless there is an ongoing relationship with the patient.

	 

	Further options introduced today include:

	• consultation by telephone or video to enable family physicians and specialists to help Manitobans manage their acute, chronic and complex health conditions; 

	• consultation by developmental pediatricians for families who care for children with developmental difficulties, ensuring timely access to care from home; and 

	• chronic pain management assessments and followup appointments to ensure people have safe access to these care needs. 

	 

	“The investments we are making today support the implementation of Manitoba’s Clinical and Preventive Services Plan by bringing health care closer to the patient in a timely way,” said Friesen. “This particularly supports health-care services for those in rural and remote communities, as well as Manitobans with mobility issues and other barriers to care.”

	 

	The minister noted work is also underway to address how physicians can adapt their practices to provide services in other areas of the health-care system as needed during the pandemic.

	 

	“While case numbers are currently stable, we must continue to plan for times during this pandemic where we may see increased case numbers and higher demands on the health-care system,” said Friesen. “By doing this work now, we will be in a better position to help Manitobans access the care they need, when and where they need it.”

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR TRAILS IN MANITOBA PROVINCIAL PARKS


	The Manitoba government is investing up to $500,000 to support the development of trails in provincial parks, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires and Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard announced today.

	 

	“Our government is committed to continue building, maintaining and expanding Manitoba’s trail network over the long term in partnership with volunteer and community organizations like Trails Manitoba,” said Squires. “Accessing trails and pathways in a safe manner, while maintaining proper physical distancing, has become a respite during these unprecedented times. Trails can play an important role in our recovery and rebuilding following this pandemic.”

	 

	With the assistance of Trails Manitoba, funding announced today will allow for the completion of six trails in Manitoba provincial parks, helping link the 1,755-kilometre Great Trail in Manitoba including:

	• South Whiteshell Trail;

	• South Whiteshell Trail – Penniac Bay;

	• Cabin Lake Creek Pedestrian Bridge;

	• Centennial Trail – Hansons Creek Bridge Phase 2;

	• North Whiteshell emergency repair washout; and

	• Spruce Woods Provincial Park.

	 

	“Our government recognizes the positive impact in being able to connect with nature, now more than ever as Manitobans navigate this challenging time posed by the global health pandemic,” said Guillemard. “Trails Manitoba plays a valuable leadership role in the creation, maintenance and enhancement of trails across Manitoba, and we will continue to partner with organizations to provide Manitobans with more opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, all year long.”

	 

	“We are very grateful to the Province of Manitoba for its long-standing support of our provincial trail network,” said Erik Dickson, president, Trails Manitoba. “This funding will help improve safety and accessibility in several beloved trails in our beautiful provincial parks as well as promotes sustainability in the adaptive re-use of two pedestrian bridges from Kings Park in Winnipeg.”

	 

	Trails Manitoba was formed in 1993 to support growing interest in recreational trail development throughout the province. Trails Manitoba is now the umbrella organization for 22 trails associations and is governed by a volunteer board with regional representation.

PROVINCE HIGHLIGHTS ADAPTABILITY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19
					  Companies and Organizations Retooling to Help Keep Manitobans Safe: Helwer


	The Manitoba government is saluting Manitoba-based companies and organizations who are using their ingenuity in the fight against COVID-19, Central Services Minister Reg Helwer announced today.

	“Our government has put out a call to any business or group in Manitoba which can retool and help us keep Manitobans safe and healthy,” said Helwer. “The response has been outstanding and demonstrates our province’s community spirit and resourcefulness in working together to fight COVID-19.”

	Dozens of businesses and organizations across Manitoba have adapted operations to help provide the province with much-needed medical supplies. Some examples include:
	•    The Winnipeg location of Winpak, a firm that manufactures and distributes packaging materials and machines, answered the call for the production of 100,000 protective face shields. The Winpak division team in Winnipeg sprung into action with a synchronized effort between departments to find the appropriate materials to make prototypes. Winpak also enlisted other local vendors including Sur Seal Packaging, Hillary Production Machining and MacDon Industries to provide additional materials and labour to assist in assembling all the components required for the face shields. Starting April 27, Winpak will delivering 10,000 face shields per week to the Manitoba government. These shields will then be distributed to front-line health-care workers.
	•    Icon Technologies of Winkler has retooled its facility, which normally produces after-market RV/motorhome parts and custom plastic products, and are now producing much-needed face shields for the health-care system. With a sharp drop in demand due to COVID-19, Icon was facing the possibility of having to lay off most of its 60 employees. By transitioning to the manufacturing of face shields, it has been able to keep its entire workforce employed with a production level of up to 6000 shields per day. These shields are being supplied to Manitoba facilities and other neighbouring jurisdictions as well.
	•    Decker Colony in western Manitoba is one of a number of Hutterite colonies that have collectively produced and shipped an estimated 30,000 fabric-based masks for health-care facilities and other organizations and groups across Manitoba. These colonies have also produced other fabric and plastic-based products including gowns, ear savers and surgery caps. In one instance, Seven Oaks General Hospital supplied 30 bolts of cloth, which was used to make 1,000 hospital gowns. In addition to health-care facilities, products supplied by Manitoba Hutterite colonies have also been distributed to a number of First Nations across southern Manitoba, a women’s shelter in Brandon and the Kidney Foundation of Manitoba.

	“These are just some of the many examples of Manitobans finding creative solutions to help combat COVID-19,” added Helwer. “I want to extend sincere thanks to all the businesses and organizations who have joined this effort and invite others that may be able to retool operations to consider doing so. By working together, we can help keep Manitobans safe and healthy.”

	The Manitoba government continues to call on manufacturers, businesses and other organizations to assist in procurement efforts.

	The province is asking manufacturers or businesses to visit the COVID-19 portal at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/index.html if:
	•    they can rapidly scale up production or retool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19; or
	•    they have a stock of personal protective equipment that is not being used due to closures and physical distancing.

	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition. More information can be found at https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/.

MANITOBA TO JOIN ONTARIO IN TREATMENT OF EMERGENCY BENEFIT AS INCOME
					  People with Disabilities to Receive Additional Support: Stefanson


	Manitoba will be joining Ontario in ensuring that provincial Employment and Income Assistance (EIA) clients who are receiving the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) will have more money in their pockets and continue to receive needed health benefits, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“Individuals on EIA who qualify for the CERB will continue to receive the benefits they need to get through this difficult time,” said Stefanson. “This complements actions our government has already taken to support our most vulnerable citizens including investments made as part of our Manitoba Protection Plan. Our government will continue to support our most vulnerable citizens as we fight this pandemic together.”

	The federal CERB benefit will be treated as earned income under EIA. As a result, EIA clients who receive the CERB benefit will receive more than they would on EIA alone. They will also continue to receive prescription drug, dental and optical benefits regardless of whether they are still eligible for provincial social assistance. For example, by treating the CERB as earned income, a couple with two children will receive $2,270 per month under both programs while still qualifying for needed health benefits.

	In addition, individuals with disabilities who are new applicants to EIA will receive the same enhanced earnings exemption as existing clients. This change will make it easier for people with disabilities whose employment has been impacted by COVID-19 to receive EIA benefits in addition to the CERB.

	Families will also be able to keep the increased Canada Child Benefit and GST rebate without any impact to their EIA benefits, the minister noted.

	The province will work with clients to help them navigate the federal process and explain how it will affect their EIA benefits. This will include helping them resume receiving support from EIA once the CERB benefits end.

	The Manitoba government is taking all steps necessary to protect the health and safety of residents and reduce the spread of COVID-19. The EIA program continues to work with clients by telephone, email, fax, and online to provide support while helping to limit the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing.

	The EIA program has also extended coverage for health or medical needs, volunteer benefits and employment and training supports until further notice.

	Earlier this week, the Ontario minister of children, community and social services announced that his government would be treating the CERB as earned income for clients in the Ontario Works and Ontario Disability Support programs.

	Public health officials advise one new case of COVID-19 was identified as of 9:30 a.m. today, bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 263.

	The data also shows:
	•    seven individuals are currently hospitalized, which includes three individuals in intensive care;
	•    61 active cases and 196 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.

	As of yesterday, an additional 786 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 22,172.

	Over the past four weeks, a number of non-urgent surgical and diagnostic procedures have been postponed for patients identified as being clinically able to wait without risk of negative outcomes. Postponements are part of the provincial effort to ensure flexibility and availability in the allocation of staff, beds, equipment and supplies required to respond to COVID-19.

	Case-by-case clinical assessment has ensured urgent and emergent procedures, as well as those patients who may become urgent or emergent during the postponement timeframe, are completed. Patient safety and avoiding negative outcomes remain the priority.

	Over the next week, a number of facilities across the province will begin to increase their surgical activity. This includes increased surgical activity at Health Sciences Centre, the Pan Am Clinic, Concordia Hospital, Misericordia Health Centre, Grace Hospital, St. Boniface Hospital, Victoria General Hospital, Boundary Trails Health Centre, Selkirk Regional Health Centre and Brandon General Hospital.

	Surgeries will be scheduled for the most urgent cases first and all necessary precautions, including point of care testing, appropriate PPE and limiting the number of staff in the room to those who are essential for patient care, will be taken to protect staff and patients from the risk of COVID-19. Patients will be contacted directly about scheduling their surgery.

	Manitoba is part of a national effort to share important medical equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) and has agreed to divert 100 vital sign monitors to Quebec and Ontario – two of the hardest-hit provinces in the fight against COVID-19. The equipment was to arrive in Manitoba next week but will now be diverted to Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto and the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal. Manitoba is early in the response to COVID-19 and clinical leaders are confident the province is able to provide this assistance without risk to Manitobans. Another shipment of equipment is expected to arrive in Manitoba in about a month.

	Public health officials have expanded testing criteria. It is important for people who meet the criteria and are showing even mild symptoms of COVID-19, including a cough, a runny nose, a sore throat and a fever, to be tested to better determine the spread of the virus in Manitoba.

					  Initiative Will Help Students and Employers, Stimulate Manitoba's Economy During an Unprecedented Summer: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government has launched the Summer Student Recovery Plan, a new wage subsidy program to support high school and post-secondary students employed in the private and non-profit sectors, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“The new wage subsidy program will support our students and connect them to summer jobs that help pay for their studies and also provide the opportunity to gain valuable work experience,” said Pallister. “Students can help businesses adapt their workplaces for social distancing as work resumes and this new wage subsidy program will help offset staffing costs in this challenging time.”

	Under the new program, up to $120 million is available for employers to access a $7 per hour wage subsidy, up to a maximum of $5,000 per student. The program is open to Manitoba students aged 15 to 29, with an employment period from May 1 to Sept. 4. Employers can be subsidized to hire up to five students. Reimbursement will be provided at the end of the employment period, upon proof of payment of student wages.

	Employers must place students in jobs that can be accommodated under current public health orders and be able to adapt to recommendations provided by public health officials over the summer.

	For the first two weeks of the program, priority will be given to employers who do not qualify for the various federal government assistance programs.
	   
	“While we work toward carefully re-opening our economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, more opportunities will be available for students as the summer progresses,” said Pallister. “Our students need the support and experience, and the Summer Student Recovery Plan will help stimulate our economy and move Manitoba forward.”

	In addition to the subsidy program, Manitoba recently announced that it is deferring payments on student loans which will assist post-secondary students who are affected by the economic impact of COVID-19, the Premier noted.

MANITOBA PUBLIC INSURANCE TO ISSUE REBATE CHEQUES TO POLICYHOLDERS
					  Welcome Relief to Customers During COVID-19 Pandemic:  Wharton

Watch news conference





	Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) is returning up to $110 million to provide financial relief to its policyholders, Crown Services Minister Jeff Wharton announced today.

	“Many Manitobans have been financially impacted by this crisis,” said Wharton. “MPI is proactively providing relief when it is needed most by issuing rebates to its customers as an alternative to future reduced premiums.”

	Rebates will be based on what policyholders paid last year and expected to be around 11 per cent, or between $140 to $160, per average policyholder, the minister noted, adding policyholders can expect a rebate cheque at the end of May to early June.

	This surplus is the result of fewer claims during this COVID period, coupled with strong year-end financial results. As a public insurance model, MPI operates on a break-even basis and is required to maintain its reserves at a level set by legislation. Today’s rebate is possible because MPI’s reserves are exceptionally strong, allowing excess capital to be returned to ratepayers while ensuring its reserves are fully funded.

	“This money is expected to provide financial assistance to Manitobans during this unprecedented crisis,” said Ben Graham, president and CEO, MPI. “We have made significant improvements in our operations to deliver value to Manitobans resulting in stronger financial results.

	“With a healthy reserve fund, MPI is in a strong financial situation to move forward with these rebate cheques to support our customers. This rebate to our customers will not adversely impact the corporation’s financial outcomes moving forward. It feels right to give back to our customers when they need it the most.”

	Details of the rebates will be made in the coming weeks and further details will be available at www.mpi.mb.ca/Pages/Home.aspx.

	In addition to rebating excess capital from the last financial year, MPI notes that as of mid-April, collision claims are down 48 per cent compared to the same month a year ago. MPI estimates that public health orders directing the public to stay at home and for non-essential businesses to cease direct interaction with the public have resulted in approximately $29 million in fewer basic claims being incurred between March 15 and April 15, 2020.

	Under existing legislation, MPI is able to return approximately $50 million to its ratepayers and will require the approval of the Public Utilities Board (PUB) for the additional $60 million. MPI will apply to the PUB in the coming days in respect of the incremental $60 million in order to be able to return these amounts to Manitoba ratepayers. If PUB approval is obtained in the next few weeks, the entire $110 million will be returned as part of the rebate cheques mailed to Manitobans.

	Based on current projections, MPI is confident that due to the extension of public health orders and the provincial state of emergency extending until May 18, related savings to the corporation will continue into the foreseeable future.

	“Our government has committed $400 million for the COVID-19 Procurement Fund as part of our Manitoba Protection Plan,” said Helwer. “Thanks to our ongoing procurement efforts, we are very pleased to have taken delivery of a substantial order of personal protective equipment for our front-line health-care workers.”

	This shipment, which landed in Winnipeg Tuesday afternoon on a chartered Air Canada Boeing 777, contains 150,000 disposable isolation gowns. This order was supplied by SpiritRx Services, a Manitoba-based medical supply company owned by the Spirit Healthcare Group representing the seven tribal councils of Manitoba.

	“The Spirit Healthcare Group was pleased to have had the opportunity to work with the Manitoba government,” said Heather Berthelette, CEO, Spirit Healthcare Group, and Chief Dennis Meeches, board chair. “Our First Nations, Manitoba-based company was able to source and supply this much-needed personal protective equipment required by the province.”

	“We want to thank all of our partners who helped ensure the successful delivery of this vitally important personal protective equipment,” Helwer said. “Our government will continue to source and acquire the PPE and other supplies needed to keep Manitobans safe and ensure that our province wins in the fight against COVID-19.”

					  Manitoba Businesses are Struggling, We Want to Support Them: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is providing up to $120 million to support Manitoba’s small and medium-sized businesses that are facing significant challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Manitoba’s small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of our economy. They are struggling right now and we want to support them,” said Pallister. “Our government has been listening and working diligently with chambers of commerce across the province, business and retail councils, industry and trade associations and various stakeholders to identity where the greatest need is and to maximize the recovery opportunities for Manitoba’s business sector.”

	The Manitoba Gap Protection Program (MGPP) is available to any of the approximately 120,000 businesses in Manitoba who have fallen into a gap in failing to qualify for the various federal government assistance programs and wage subsidies created because of COVID-19. If one in six businesses have fallen into that gap that would mean approximately 20,000 Manitoba businesses would be entitled to this support, the premier noted.
	 
	The province will advance each eligible business the non-interest bearing forgivable MGPP loan of $6,000, for a total of up to $120 million. The loan will be forgiven on Dec. 31, 2020, if the recipient attests at that time the business has not received any major non-repayable COVID-19 federal supports such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Business Account, as well as sector-specific grant federal programs specifically developed in response to the pandemic. If the applicant has received benefits under a federal COVID program, then the loan will be added to the recipient’s 2020 tax bill.

	“We are acting on the advice from industry and are committed to working in partnership with our municipal and federal governments and various associations that are impacted by this pandemic so we’ll make the right decisions, in the right way, at the right time to maximize our recovery efforts for the benefit of all Manitobans,” said Pallister.

	To be eligible for the MGPP funding, a business must:
	•    have been operational on March 20, 2020, the date the Manitoba government declared a provincewide state of emergency under The Emergency Measures Act because of COVID-19;
	•    have temporarily ceased or curtailed operations as a result of a COVID-19 public health order and have been harmed by the health order;
	•    be registered and in good standing with the Manitoba Business and Corporate Registry;
	•    have not qualified for federal government COVID-19 grant support; and
	•    have an email address and a bank account.

RED RIVER REACHES PEAK FLOWS IN MANITOBA
					  River Crests at Lower Predicted Range for Spring 2020: Schuler

Watch news conference




	The Red River crest has arrived in southern Manitoba at its lower predicted range, Infrastructure Minster Ron Schuler announced today.

	“This is good news as the substantial run-off we’re seeing throughout the Red River Basin will remain at the lower end of the forecast, with levels similar to those we saw in 2006 at Emerson and Letellier and levels closer to 2019 north from St. Jean Baptiste,” said Schuler. “We always prepare for the worst but hope for the best, and so far the weather has co-operated. Cooler temperatures have slowed the melt and helped control high water in Manitoba, and we aren’t expecting any major spring storms in the week ahead.”

	The Red River has crested from Emerson to St. Jean Baptiste. Provincial Trunk Highway (PTH) 75 at Morris is expected to remain open, as an earthen ramp has been constructed at the north end of Morris so traffic can continue to use the highway. The river is expected to peak today at Morris, Ste. Agathe and St. Adolphe, and within the next 24 hours at the Red River Floodway inlet south of Winnipeg. A flood warning remains in place for the river from Emerson to the Red River Floodway inlet.

	Provincial crews were deployed in a number of communities in the Red River Valley to close ring dikes as required. Pumping operations are underway at most ring dike communities. Response teams are observing recommended public health measures for COVID-19.

	Operation of the floodway continues to reduce water levels in Winnipeg. The Red River level is around 18.7 feet at James Avenue with the crest forecast to arrive within the next two days at between 19 and 19.3 ft., maintained by floodway operation. The current flow in the floodway channel is almost 20,000 cubic feet per second.

	The Red River is now projected to return within bank in early May. The Red River Floodway will likely continue operations until mid-May depending on future weather conditions.

	The minister noted that levels are reducing along the Red River in North Dakota, currently at 18.2 ft. in Fargo and 35.6 ft. in Grand Forks. At this time, there is sufficient capacity in the channel to withstand a major storm.

	Downstream north of Winnipeg, the ice cleared out a few days ago so ice dam-related high water is no longer an issue. A high water advisory remains in place for the Red River from Lockport to Netley Creek as water levels remain high and will continue to rise as the peak moves down the river.

	Lake Winnipeg is at 714.9 ft. while Lake Manitoba is at 811.4 ft., both within operating levels. The province has issued, and will continue to issue, high wind and ice pileup warnings as required as the ice dissipates.

	The Assiniboine River and northern rivers such as the Saskatchewan and Carrot near The Pas are forecast to remain mostly in bank. The Assiniboine peak is forecast to reach Winnipeg tomorrow, with little or no influence on James Avenue levels in Winnipeg. Ice jams on the Saskatchewan and Carrot rivers could cause temporary over-bank high water. The Portage Diversion ceased operations yesterday.

	A number of roads are impacted by high water levels including parts of Provincial Road (PR) 217, PR 246 and PR 320. For detours and a complete list of closures, visit www.manitoba511.ca.

	The Hydrologic Forecast Centre provides daily high water reports at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/floodinfo/index.html.

	Public health officials advise one new case of COVID-19 was identified as of 9:30 a.m. today, bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 255.

	The data also shows:
	•    seven individuals are currently hospitalized, which includes four individuals in intensive care;
	•    99 active cases and 150 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 314 tests on Monday. A total of 20,319 tests have been performed since early February.

	Public health officials have expanded testing criteria to ensure there is capacity to do additional testing. It is important for people showing symptoms of COVID-19, including a cough, a runny nose, a sore throat and a fever, to be tested to better determine the spread of the virus in Manitoba.

	Manitobans are reminded that if they are showing symptoms of COVID-19 and meet testing criteria, they should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257.

	For up-to-date information on testing criteria and community screening sites, visit www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html. For more information and to access the online screening tool for COVID-19, visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Public health officials advise Manitobans to stay home as much as possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This includes only travelling to the cottage or second residence if needed. If people must travel, they are encourage to:
	•    only travel with family members,
	•    not visit with others on arrival,
	•    avoid stopping for gas or other supplies on the way, and
	•    only visit local health-care providers in case of emergency.

	Manitoba health officials are taking every available and appropriate step to protect the province’s health-care workforce from exposure to COVID-19 so they are able to take care of sick and vulnerable Manitobans over the coming weeks and months. This includes steps to enhance screening at all health-care facilities, implement visitor restrictions, encourage virtual visit options and postpone non-essential services.

	Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a supplement to these and other measures including strict hand hygiene and both social and physical distancing.

	Similar to other jurisdictions, Manitoba has engaged experts in infection prevention and control, and occupational and environmental health and safety to identify the supplies required to protect workers in critical and priority services.

	Settings and situations have been categorized according to the level of risk to workers and to the population they are caring for and the required PPE has been set out accordingly. These include:
	•    green zones, which are settings and situations involving care or service for individuals who are not considered COVID-19 suspects;
	•    orange zones, which are settings and situations involving care or service for individuals who meet the criteria for COVID-19 testing, AND who have been tested AND whose results are pending; and
	•    red zones, which are settings and situations involving care or service for individuals who have been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19.

	To conserve PPE for health-care workers, public health officials are recommending all people who enter a health-care facility wear a cloth mask to protect others. In addition, patients and clients are encouraged to wear non-medical face masks during any health-care interaction, as well as when using public transit, handi-transit or a taxi.

WORKERS COMPENSATION BOARD OF MANITOBA RETURNS $37-MILLION SURPLUS TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL RELIEF TO EMPLOYERS
					  Welcome Relief to Manitoba Employers During COVID-19 Pandemic: Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba is returning a $37-million surplus to provide financial relief to eligible employers in the province, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“The COVID-19 pandemic is having a dramatic impact on employers across the province, with businesses especially hurting right now, and we’re working across government and with our partners to find ways to provide relief to employers that need it,” said Pallister. “Given the economic uncertainties, these actions will provide money to employers at a time where cash flow is a challenge.”

	The Workers Compensation Board (WCB) board of directors has approved and authorized further relief for employers who fund the WCB by returning approximately $37 million in surplus funds.

	“The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the majority of our customers and we have actively explored how we can help mitigate the financial impact to employers,” said Michael Werier, chairperson of the WCB. “With a healthy reserve fund, we are pleased to provide a refund of approximately 20 per cent to employers to help bolster their bottom line. It’s incumbent upon businesses like ourselves to do our part to actively help support financial recovery efforts over the next several months.”

	This is the second year the WCB has returned surplus funds to eligible employers while still maintaining the lowest assessment rate in Canada. In making this decision, the WCB’s board of directors considered the long-term financial projections in conjunction with maintaining rate stability and still protecting the workers compensation system against risk, uncertainty and market volatility.

	In May, eligible employers will receive a credit to their account based on 20 per cent of their 2019 premium. To be eligible to receive the surplus, employers must have fulfilled their payroll reporting responsibilities for 2019 and paid a WCB premium in 2019. Employers can still report their 2019 payroll to receive the surplus distribution.

	For the health-care sector, which includes regional health authorities and several other agencies such as CancerCare Manitoba, Riverview Health Centre and personal care homes, this equals an approximate $6.2-million refund.

	Of the $37 million, WCB expects $29 million will be returned to the private sector, with approximately $7 million going to small businesses in Manitoba.

	“We are proud the work we’ve done over the years to increase our system efficiency allows us to have the lowest WCB rate in Canada and we can now offer some measure of relief to employers suffering the financial hardships COVID-19 has created,” said Winston Maharaj, president and CEO, WCB. “We applaud all of the employers and front-line workers who continue to serve the public in these extremely challenging times.”

	Earlier this month, WCB announced it would defer premium payments until the end of May, not charge business interest and/or penalties for non-payment until October, extend the payroll-reporting deadline until the end of May and ensure that coverage remains active for accounts that choose to defer payments until the end of October. Clearances will remain in good standing.

	The WCB is a mutual workplace injury and disability statutory corporation funded by employer premiums. It insures more than 34,000 employers and 76 per cent of the Manitoba workforce.

	The province has partnered with a well-established Manitoba company to retool its production lines to supply Level 1 isolation gowns for Manitoba front-line health-care workers. MWG Apparel Corp. has been contracted to provide up to 200,000 gowns to the Manitoba government on a priority basis. This contract will immediately support 43 jobs in Manitoba. The province applauds MWG for its efforts and thanks them for joining the fight against COVID-19 in Manitoba.

	Manitoba manufacturers or businesses able to provide supplies and those who are prepared to retool and rapidly scale up production lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19 are asked to visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19supplies to register their interest.

	Shared Health has also issued a call to businesses who have personal protective equipment on hand.

PROVINCE LAUNCHES NEWLY DESIGNED WEBSITE FOR BILINGUAL SERVICE CENTRES


	The Manitoba government has redesigned its bilingual service centres website to make it easier for Manitobans to find the services and information they need online, Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires, minister responsible for francophone affairs, announced today.

	“The website offers a more user-friendly experience, with a streamlined, modern design and improved navigation,” said Squires. “Our government is committed to improving Manitobans’ access to services in French, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when online services have never been more critical.”

	The bilingual service centres offer a one-stop shop where Manitobans can access information about programs offered by all three levels of government and numerous community organizations.

	The website is designed to help the public navigate government services more easily and find the appropriate program areas to contact for additional information across a wide variety of sectors.

	There are six bilingual service centres in Manitoba, located in the designated bilingual regions of the province, which have a concentration of French-speaking residents. Each centre is unique to the region, and staff are available to help residents in the official language of their choice – French or English. The Francophone Affairs Secretariat administers the centres.

	The centres are located in:  
	•    Winnipeg:
	      -    St. Boniface at 204-945-6220;
	      -    St. Vital/St. Norbert at 204-945-0600;
	•    St-Pierre-Jolys (Red River Region) at 204-433-3340;
	•    Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes (Mountain Region) at 204-248-7270;
	•    St. Laurent (Interlake Region) at 204-646-4095; and
	•    Ste. Anne (Seine River Region) at 204-422-7020.

	To help minimize the spread of COVID-19, drop-in services are unavailable at the bilingual service centres at this time, but staff continue to provide assistance to the public by telephone (toll-free) at1-866-267-6114 or email at csbsc@gov.mb.ca.

	The Manitoba government is investing an additional $300 million to ensure the government can respond quickly to front-line health-care needs and protect vulnerable Manitobans, Central Services Minister Reg Helwer announced today.

	“Our government has already fast-tracked $100 million in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 through our Manitoba Protection Plan,” said Helwer. “Today, we’re quadrupling our commitment to $400 million for the COVID-19 Procurement Fund to ensure our plan is effective and that we can continue to be proactive in the steps we take to protect Manitobans during this pandemic.”

	This investment will support outbreak planning, prevention and mitigation efforts, and allow the province to secure the supplies and resources needed to deliver the best care possible for Manitoba patients.

	Funds are being used for purposes such as:
	•    purchasing significant amounts of essential medical supplies and equipment, including personal protective equipment;
	•    developing hotel capacity for those requiring isolation;
	•    preparing for large-scale low acuity medical overflow for hospitals;

	•    providing training and grants to child-care experts to become entrepreneurs by opening their own small-scale daycares;
	•    establishing a COVID-19 research fund through Research Manitoba;

	•    opening multiple provincewide testing sites to bolster the response to this health crisis.

	“This new investment continues to address the needs of our front-line health-care workers and patients,” said Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen. “Our government is taking every step possible to protect Manitoba families and ensure people are able to get the care they need during this critical time.”

	The Manitoba government has also undertaken a number of investments to provide immediate relief to Manitobans facing financial challenges by deferring provincial fees and charges, funding support for child-care services for critical service providers and expanding shelter capacity to support people affected by homelessness, noted Helwer.

	The province is asking manufacturers or businesses to visit the COVID-19 portal at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/business/index.html if:
	•    they can rapidly scale up production or re-tool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19; or
	•    they have a stock of personal protective equipment that is not being used due to closures and physical distancing.

	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition. More information can be found at https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/.

	Public health officials advise four new cases of COVID-19 were identified as of 9:30 a.m. today, bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 250.

	The data also shows:
	•    eight individuals are currently hospitalized, which includes four individuals in intensive care;
	•    124 active cases and 121 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at five.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 449 tests Wednesday. A total of 18,349 tests have been performed since early February.

	The chief provincial public health officer has updated public health orders that take effect on April 17, and will be in effect until May 1, 2020. They mandate that anyone entering Manitoba, regardless of whether it was from another country or another province must self-isolate for 14 days. In addition, travel to northern Manitoba (north of the 53rd parallel of latitude) is prohibited with some exceptions including:
	•    residents of northern and remote communities may continue to move within the north;
	•    delivery of goods and services may continue; and
	•    exceptions include those who travel to the north for employment, medical treatment or to facilitate child-custody agreements.

	The new orders build on the current orders, and maintain the gathering size of no more than 10 people at any indoor or outdoor premises. Additional updates include:
	•    a clarification that businesses not listed as critical may operate, and have customers attend to pick up ordered items, providing social distancing measures are in place;
	•    a provision to allow farmers markets to operate, providing social distancing measures are in place;
	•    hotels may operate, but must close common areas such as pools, hot tubs and game rooms;
	•    campgrounds can provide accommodation to recreational vehicles that act as a primary residence;
	•    garden centres and greenhouses can operate, providing social distancing measures are in place; and
	•    appliance, electronic and furniture stores are excluded, and should not be open to the public, except where orders are placed remotely and orders are delivered or picked up with social distancing measures in place.

	The following restrictions remain in place as they were with previous orders:
	•    All restaurants and other commercial facilities are prohibited from serving food to customers in their premises. This prevents eat-in dining at all facilities. However, restaurants and other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or takeout. If this takes place, the operator of the restaurant must ensure that all people maintain the appropriate social distancing from other customers when picking up food.
	•    All businesses that are not listed in the schedule of critical services that accompanies the order must remain closed.
	-    This closure order does not prevent these businesses from operating on a remote basis.
	-    A business may accept orders on the internet or over the phone for delivery or pickup, as long as the employees are not working at the place of business.
	-    The order does not prevent employees or others from coming into the business to perform repairs, to provide security services or to take out items from the business premises if the business is going to operate on a remote basis.
	-    Nothing in the order restricts the operations of delivery of services by the federal or provincial governments or a municipality.
	-    Nothing in the order restricts any activities of a publicly funded agency, organization or authority that delivers or supports government operations or services including health-care services. This means the order does not affect institutions, agencies and other service providers offering health-care services such as hospitals, regional health authorities and private agencies that provide a range of health services.

	In addition, public health officials are expanding testing criteria to include:
	•    all symptomatic workers or volunteers at workplaces that have been identified as essential services; and
	•    any symptomatic person who lives with a health-care worker, first responder or worker in a congregate setting such as a correctional facility, shelter, long-term care or residential facility.

	Current testing parameters include people with symptoms who have travelled outside Manitoba in the past 14 days, close contacts of a confirmed case, health-care workers, all patients admitted to hospital with respiratory symptoms, lab workers who have worked with COVID-19 tests, first responders and individuals who live/work in the north, a remote or isolated community, or congregate setting.

	Assessment clinics for COVID-19 patients offer primary care services on an appointment basis for anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or has respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat or shortness of breath. In addition to the primary care space, these locations also serve as designated testing sites in a separate area at the site.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

INTERNET-BASED THERAPY SERVICE PROGRAM TO HELP MANITOBANS COPE WITH COVID-19 ANXIETY NOW LIVE
					  Province Invests $4.5 Million in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Program to Support Manitobans:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	A digital cognitive behavioural therapy program to support the mental health of Manitobans and help address anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is now up and running, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“We recognize many Manitobans are living with anxiety and stress posed by this pandemic,” said Pallister. “Our government is committed to helping Manitobans navigate this challenging and unprecedented time. You are not alone, we will get through this together.”

	The AbilitiCBT program is a free and confidential virtual-therapy platform and has proven to be one of the most effective and efficient therapy methods available, the premier added.

	As of this morning, close to 600 individuals have registered for the program, and are now using the virtual-therapy platform with more signing up daily. 

	The program is guided by professional therapists and addresses mild to moderate anxiety symptoms related to the uniquely challenging aspects of pandemics:
	•    uncertainty,
	•    physical isolation,
	•    caring for family and community members,
	•    information overload, and
	•    stress management.

	The program will help people:
	•    learn what anxiety is and how it affects their emotions, mind, body and behaviour;
	•    reduce anxiety by learning cognitive behavioral-therapy skills and using them to change responses to triggers; and
	•    develop coping strategies to track and reduce anxiety and better manage daily activities.

	The premier noted people do not need to be referred to the program by a doctor, they can start at any time by completing the online assessment on the website.

	Once people register online, they are asked to download an app, as well as to complete and submit a health-screening questionnaire. A therapist will reach out within three days to book an initial assessment by phone.

	People will then complete 10 modules on the app at their own pace, while the therapist tracks and monitors progress. There will be scheduled check-ins along the way by phone, chat or through a video check-in to make sure people are getting the help they need.

	The internet-based cognitive behavioural-therapy service is free of charge to all Manitobans 16 years old and over. Services are available in English and French. The program can be accessed at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

	Crisis mental-health services continue to be available through partner organizations in Manitoba at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mh/crisis.html.

MANITOBA OFFICIALLY ADOPTS NEW WEST PARTNERSHIP TRADE AGREEMENT
					  Proclamation of Legislative Provisions and Regulations to Adopt Agreement Will Expand Province's Trade Markets, Increase Business Opportunities and Create Jobs:  Eichler


	Manitoba has proclaimed the final legislative provisions and regulations necessary to officially adopt the New West Partnership Trade Agreement that will bring the province new and exciting opportunities for private-sector investment and job creation, Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“The adoption of this trade agreement with the three other western provinces brings Manitoba into a new and exciting era in positioning itself for economic growth,” said Eichler. “Our province will move forward and prosper through diversified markets for trade and the creation of quality jobs, while our participation in the agreement strengthens the economic potential of the four jurisdictions as a whole.”

	Manitoba entered the New West Partnership with Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia in 2016, creating an open and common trade market of more than 11 million people with a combined GDP of more than $750 billion. The Manitoba government cabinet’s new proclamation this week has brought into force provisions of the Business Names Registration Act, the Partnerships Act, the Corporations Act and the Cooperatives Act, as well as regulatory changes, to enable reciprocal registrations of businesses across the four provinces and an elimination of unnecessary and antiquated fees for them.

	The New West Partnership Trade Agreement commits each of the four western provinces to enhance trade, investment and labour mobility, and to remove barriers to the movement of goods, services, investment and people within and between the jurisdictions. Manitoba companies and families will benefit from improved business opportunities through the partnership, which covers more than 30 per cent of Canada’s population.

	“The potential through the New West Partnership for the creation of quality jobs is in step with our government’s Manitoba Works program, which aims to generate 40,000 new jobs in our province over the next four years,” said Eichler. “This trade agreement brings opportunities for new growth, and has long been called for by Manitoba business owners and chambers of commerce. It’s a chance for Manitoba to take advantage of its enormous potential with its resource wealth and its central location in Canada and North America.”

	Manitoba’s entry to the New West Partnership, which was formed in 2010 by the governments of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, strengthens and expands Canada’s largest, barrier-free interprovincial market. By adopting the agreement, Manitoba is strengthening its industries and positioning itself to prosper in the national economy while making families across the province safer and stronger.

PROVINCE INVESTING MORE THAN $1.5 MILLION IN NEW MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS IN DAUPHIN, WINNIPEG TO SUPPORT MANITOBA FAMILIES
					  This First-for-Manitoba Peer Support Program Will Help Individuals and Families, Regardless of Their Mental Health Diagnosis:  Friesen


	The Manitoba government is investing more than $1.5 million over three years in a new initiative to provide peer and family support services in Winnipeg and the Prairie Mountain Health region, led by the Manitoba Schizophrenia Society, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Peer support services have shown significant results in other jurisdictions in reducing inpatient hospital admissions, decreasing length of stay and rates of re-admission, and improving patient and family experiences in crisis situations,” said Friesen.

	The Manitoba Schizophrenia Society will develop and offer a new program called Peer 2 Peer Connections services at Winnipeg’s Crisis Response Centre and the Dauphin Regional Health Centre.  The program will serve all individuals and families, regardless of their mental health diagnosis.

	“We are excited to implement the Peer 2 Peer Connections initiative in collaboration with Robyn Priest Live Your Truth within the Crisis Response Centre and Dauphin Regional Health Centre to demonstrate the importance of providing peer support along the mental health continuum of care,” said Julia Hoeppner, interim executive director, Manitoba Schizophrenia Society (MSS).  “This initiative will positively impact both individuals and families dealing with various mental health diagnosis as peer and family support workers share their stories of resiliency to light a path in the direction of wellness and recovery.”

	The equivalent of 12 new full-time individual and family peer support-worker positions will be created across the two sites, along with a manager to oversee the day-to-day operations of the program.

	In this unique program, people with their own lived experience of mental health or addictions issues will be able to offer support and insight for others experiencing similar challenges.

	Peer support programs offer an evidence-based service that uses the expertise of trained staff with lived experience to support the recovery of people struggling with mental health and addictions.

	Support staff work with clients and families from initial contact through ongoing support and post-discharge followup.

	Peer 2 Peer Connections fits well within the new MSS vision of ‘Mental Wellness for All’ and its mission, which is “to provide quality mental health education and value-based peer support for Manitobans and their families dealing with mental health challenges”.

	The minister noted the implementation of this first for Manitoba program will meet a recommendation from the VIRGO report, which identified peer support in formal health-care settings as a short-term priority.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT INTRODUCES AMENDMENTS TO STRENGTHEN THE EMERGENCY MEASURES ACT
					  Changes Will Give Province Increased Ability to Respond Effectively During a State of Emergency and Protect Vulnerable Manitobans:  Pallister


	The Manitoba government is making additions and amendments to strengthen The Emergency Measures Act and enable provincial orders that will aid in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“The Emergency Measures Amendment Act provides the provincial government with additional tools to respond to challenges that arise during a declared state of emergency and improve our response time to these challenges,” said Pallister. “These changes are part of the Manitoba Protection Plan to support the efforts of our front-line workers and protect Manitoba’s most vulnerable residents from the negative effects of COVID-19.”

	The amendments would allow decisive immediate action through provincial orders approved by the lieutenant-governor in council that take effect the day they are made and may have a retroactive effect to the start of the declared state of emergency.  

	“These order-making powers will give the province the ability to act swiftly to protect the safety and well-being of Manitobans and the resiliency of our province,” said Pallister. “They will reduce the negative impacts of public health emergencies and natural disasters and prevent people from taking advantage of other Manitobans.”

	The amendments would provide the provincial government with authority to make three types of orders:
	•    emergency orders, which allow the province to have greater ability to take decisive action to limit serious harm and damage to Manitobans, such as establishing facilities such as emergency shelters, fixing prices for necessary goods and services, and prohibiting price gouging;
	•    temporary suspension orders, which briefly suspend certain types of provisions in a statute, regulation or bylaw such as extending the length or a provincial permit or delaying filing deadlines if people affected by the emergency need greater services, benefits, or time than the law normally provides; and
	•    reporting deadline variation orders, which extend the time period for government or government agencies to file a report or information, such as extra time to prepare and table annual reports for the legislature during a declared state of emergency. The Speaker of the legislative assembly is also granted authority to issue an order for independent officers of the assembly and members of the legislative assembly.

	Currently, only the minister or a local authority may make emergency orders of a limited scope that directly limit loss of life or damage to property and the environment.

	Penalties for violating The Emergency Measures Act would increase to a maximum of $100,000 and/or one year imprisonment for individuals and a maximum of $1,000,000 for corporations.

	A new provision would also give courts the option to increase the fine for a person convicted of a price gouging offence by an amount equal to the financial benefit acquired.

	The amendments authorizing the provincial government to make emergency orders would be temporary and automatically rescinded after one year, while the other order powers would remain within legislation.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES UP TO $1 BILLION TO SUPPORT COVID-19 FIGHT
					  Increased Spending Authority will Provide Investments in Health and Across Government:  Pallister


	The Manitoba government is releasing up to $1 billion to support the government’s ongoing actions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“We are facing significant fiscal pressures as a result of the necessary shutdown of large parts of our economy as well as from the large expenses we hadn’t budgeted for that are now required to keep Manitobans safe,” said Pallister. “By increasing our spending power, we have funds at hand to quickly help those in need, whether it’s delivering personal protective equipment and other resources to front-line workers, helping families through access to child care and other supports, and aiding businesses through tax deferrals and other measures.”

	According to the Estimates of Expenditure documents tabled today, additional spending authority of up to $1 billion of COIVD-19 pandemic-related spending is requested to be allocated as follows:
	•    $500 million for the Health Services Insurance Fund,
	•    $400 million for the internal service adjustments appropriations of government, and
	•    $100 million for emergency expenditures.

	Half of the investment would be directly available for health-care costs, while $400 million would be available for allocation to new COVID-19 pandemic-related costs across the whole of government, allowing the flexibility to create new government programs or support services for Manitobans, or addressing increased costs under existing programs whose volumes have increased as a result of the pandemic.

	The province would also double the emergency expenditures budget with a second commitment of $100 million to address the costs of potential natural disasters later in the fiscal year, such as floods and forest fires, or even cover new emergency costs relating to the pandemic should they arise. The existing funding for emergency expenditures has been fully expended to cover COVID-19 costs.

	“We want to ensure we have available funds to meet anticipated and unexpected costs this fiscal year as a result of the pandemic,” said Finance Minister Scott Fielding. “We are closely monitoring the costs and resources required across government, such as procurement costs for PPE and other medical supplies for the health-care system, as well as funds needed by other departments, such as Manitoba Justice and Manitoba Families, to keep facilities safe for the Manitobans who rely on them.”

	The province is tracking all costs and expenses centrally for government departments and other reporting entities, and the premier noted full documentation of these additional funds spent will be provided in the second quarter financial update, nine months sooner than would normally occur.

MANITOBA LEGISLATURE RECALLED TO MOVE FORWARD MANITOBA PROTECTION PLAN
					  Emergency Sitting Required to Ensure Passage of Key Bills to Help Protect Most Vulnerable Manitobans During COVID-19 Pandemic:  Premier


	The Manitoba legislature is being recalled for an emergency sitting today to help expedite up to$1 billion in assistance to fight COVID-19 and protect Manitoba’s most vulnerable through the Manitoba Protection Plan, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Our government is enacting the necessary measures to protect our most valuable service – the front line of our health-care system – and Manitoba’s most vulnerable as we fight this global pandemic together,” said Pallister. “This isn’t about partisanship; this is about doing the right thing to ensure our resources are there where they are needed, when they are needed most.”

	A priority will be updating the province’s borrowing and spending authority to ensure the Manitoba government has sufficient ability to meet unexpected expenditures amidst declining revenues resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the premier noted. This authority is over and above what was presented in Budget 2020.

	The Manitoba government will also be introducing several new bills to support Manitoba’s most vulnerable and advocating for expedited passage of several existing bills to address the growing impacts of COVID-19 on Manitobans.

	“We are taking concrete steps to move forward the Manitoba Protection Plan to help ensure we are doing everything we can to support Manitobans during this unprecedented and difficult time,” said Pallister. “We are demonstrating that Manitoba is Canada’s most resilient province and together, we will get through this.”

	To ensure compliance with current two-metre social distancing measures, during today’s sitting, all parties have agreed to limit attendance to one-third of the 57 members of the legislative assembly. Members will not be seated at their usual desks, but rather be spread throughout the chamber to abide by two-metre social distancing measures.

	The public gallery will remain closed, although Manitoban can observe the sitting at:

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE GREATER SUPPORT AND JOB PROTECTION FOR THOSE IMPACTED BY COVID-19
					  Must Shift Government Resources to the Front Line:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government will now compensate health-care workers who are required to self-isolate for 14 days due to possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Our government recognizes front-line health-care providers are facing extraordinary challenges during this unprecedented time,” said Pallister. “This change will give workers peace of mind knowing they can take the necessary time to protect themselves, their patients, coworkers and the broader community.”

	The Manitoba government will provide health-care staff paid administrative leave for the full 14-day period of asymptomatic self-isolation. Should a worker become symptomatic during self-isolation, the individual will be compensated by sick leave benefits, pursuant to their collective agreement, the premier added.

	The province is also proposing new provisions to the Employment Standards Code that would allow employees to be away from work for specified reasons related to COVID-19.

	After consulting the Labour Management Review Committee, which made a consensus recommendation to provide job protection for employees affected by COVID-19, the province is moving forward with changes that would allow employees protected leave for eligible purposes.

	Employees would be able to take as much unpaid time off work as needed to:
	•    be in isolation or quarantine or take any other control measure in accordance with information or directions related to COVID-19 by health professionals, health officers, Health Links–Info Santé, the government of Manitoba or the Government of Canada, a municipal council or a board of health;
	•    obtain medical examination, supervision or treatment;
	•    comply with an order made under The Emergency Measures Act or The Public Health Act;
	•    provide care or support to a family member as a result of COVID-19, including but not limited to, school and daycare closures; or
	•    comply with travel restrictions.

	The new provisions would apply to any leave that started between March 1, 2020, and a date to be prescribed in regulation, specified once the pandemic is over.

	“We want to reassure Manitobans they won’t lose their job for taking leave to comply with public health orders to self-isolate or to seek medical attention or care for a loved one because of COVID-19,” said Pallister. “We all have a role to play in flattening COVID curve and we are committed to helping Manitobans navigate this challenging and unprecedented time.”

	The provisions also allow for other communicable diseases to be added by regulation to allow the new leave provisions to be re-instated in cases of future epidemics or pandemics.

	The Manitoba government will also be meeting with Manitoba’s public sector union leaders to discuss an ‘all-hands-on-deck’ approach response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The province is seeking ways to defer non-essential spending across all of government to ensure its ability to redirect resources to front-line health services during this critical time, the premier added.

	“Manitobans have every right to expect that their government will do everything it can to address and support our pandemic response and our health-care workers in the front lines,” said Pallister. “We expect that our public service will want to do the right thing to support these efforts and to make sure resources are where they are, when they are needed most.”

	In the coming days and weeks ahead, the province will be exploring and discussing various options to reduce non-essential spending, with the primary focus of mitigating the impact and fallout of COVID-19, the premier stated.

ONLINE AND DISTANCE-LEARNING COURSES EXPANDING FOR STUDENTS THROUGHOUT MANITOBA
					  InformNet Among Growing Platforms and Tools as Teaching Technology Develops and Improves:  Goertzen


	The province has partnered with the Pembina Trails School Division and the St. James-Assiniboia School Division to offer expanded access to InformNet online courses during the suspension of in-school classes due to COVID-19, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.  

	The expansion of InformNet comes as teachers across Manitoba embrace new approaches to teaching using this and various other online and distance-learning tools developed by schools and school divisions.

	“A growing number of teachers in Manitoba will be able to use InformNet course content with their students,” said Goertzen. “This resource offers full online courses and will expand to accommodate as many students as possible while they learn from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

	InformNet is an online high school operated by the Pembina Trails and St. James-Assiniboia school divisions, using the Department of Education’s online learning management system Brightspace by Desire 2 Learn (D2L) Corp. There are 17 courses for students in Grade 11 and Grade 12 now available to teachers across the province. Other courses may be added over time.

	The department is acting as a help desk and offering professional development to support the expansion. Coaching and assistance with applications on InformNet will be offered to teachers through a support team with direct online teaching experience.

	“This is just one of the online systems that allow Manitoba teachers to offer high-quality programs for students to learn and carry on with their studies during the 2019-20 school year,” said Goertzen. “We appreciate the willingness of divisions, schools and teachers to partner in support of a rapid transition to online learning during these unprecedented times.”

	The Department of Education offers 44 other web-based courses on the same Brightspace platform, for a total of 61 online courses available to teachers and students. More than 400 Manitoba teachers have already signed up to use Brightspace.

	In addition, print-based modules are being generated for teachers to use with students who do not have access to technology. The province has formed a working group to further explore strategies for students without Internet access.

	Planning is underway to address the particular needs of French and French immersion teachers and students. There are 12 distance-learning courses available in French and more to be added, the minister said, noting implementation will unfold over the coming weeks.

	The department also hosts the Manitoba Professional Learning Environment (Maple), which provides more than 13,000 educators with a secure space to access curriculum-related supports and resources, to share ideas and to connect with consultants and other teachers. More than 1,200 teachers in Manitoba have joined Maple since in-school classes were suspended last month.

	New groups titled Online and Unplugged: Supporting Student Learning During COVID-19 – Suspended Classes, and Corona-virus: Appuyons nos élèves, partageons nos ressources!, provide teachers with a forum to share resources and ideas for remote student learning. More than 840 educators have joined these groups.

	Public health officials advise four new cases of COVID-19 have been identified as of 9:30 a.m., bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 246.  

	The data also shows:
	•    eight individuals are currently hospitalized, which includes four individuals in intensive care;
	•    99 individuals have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba is four.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 32 tests Sunday. A total of 17,245 tests have been performed since early February.

	The chief provincial public health officer will be extending the public health orders issued on March 30 for two weeks. The orders that were to expire on April 14 are now extended to April 28, 2020, with the following measures remaining in effect:
	•    Public gatherings are limited to no more than 10 people at any indoor or outdoor place or premises. This includes places of worship, gatherings and family events such as weddings and funerals. This does not apply to a facility where health-care or social services are provided including child-care centres and homeless shelters.
	•    All restaurants and other commercial facilities that serve food are prohibited from serving food to customers in their premises. This prevents eat-in dining at all facilities. However, restaurants and other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or takeout. If this takes place, the operator of the restaurant must ensure that all people maintain the appropriate social distancing from other customers when picking up food.
	•    All businesses that are not listed in the schedule of critical services that accompanies the order must remain closed.
	-    This closure order does not prevent these businesses from operating on a remote basis.
	-    A business may accept orders on the Internet, or over the phone for delivery or pickup, as long as the employees are not working at the place of business.
	-    The order does not prevent employees or others from coming into the business to perform repairs, to provide security services or to take out items from the business premises if the business is going to operate on a remote basis.
	-    Nothing in the order restricts the operations of delivery of services by the federal or provincial governments or a municipality.
	-    Nothing in the order restricts any activities of a publicly funded agency, organization or authority that delivers or supports government operations or services, including health-care services. This means the order does not affect institutions, agencies and other service providers who provide health-care services such as hospitals, regional health authorities and private agencies who provide a range of health services.

	Manitobans should not interpret current case numbers to mean the risk of COVID-19 is reduced. The current statistics may be a reflection of the effect strict social distancing measures have had and reaffirms that these measures must be continued. Manitobans are reminded this is not the time to let their guard down.

	Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

					  Better Position Manitoba Businesses to Rebound from Pandemic:  Pallister

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government has engaged Manitoba-based business, 24-7 Intouch, to help businesses, not-for-profits and charities facing economic challenges due to COVID-19 connect with support programs, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Manitoba’s small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of our economy and they are facing pressures in ways we’ve never seen before because of the global pandemic,” said Pallister. “We want to help organizations navigate and leverage the resources available to them so they can be in a better position to rebound from the economic challenges brought on by COVID-19, and continue offering services and creating jobs into the future.”

	Pallister estimated more than 65,000 Manitoba businesses are eligible for federal support programs, such as the 75 per cent wage subsidy and Canada Emergency Business Account, which offers interest-free loans up to $40,000.

	The Manitoba government recently issued a request for proposals (RFP) from organizations that could operate a secure call centre to help inform and guide stakeholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. 24-7 Intouch, a Winnipeg-based global leader in the inbound customer-care industry, has been awarded the contract.

	The province is in the process of working with 24-7 Intouch to establish this important service in the coming days. Strict privacy protocols, including the use of personal and business information, will be in place. It will offer bilingual service with the capacity to offer assistance in other languages spoken in Manitoba.

	The premier noted the centre will offer a two-stream process to identify and reach out to identified and prioritized businesses and stakeholders that have been impacted by COVID-19 to offer help, and answer incoming calls and questions. In order to protect the privacy and security of those using this service, outbound calls will not ask for confidential information as their purpose is to advise of the services available and encourage the use the inbound line.

	Details such as call centre phone number and hours of operation will be available in the days ahead. Businesses are encouraged to regularly check the Manitoba government website to view an updated list of available federal and provincial supports at https://manitoba.ca/covid19/business/index.html.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO PRODUCE MANITOBA-DESIGNED MASKS
					  Pursuing Made-in-Manitoba Solution to Enhance Protection for Front-Line Health-Care Providers:  Friesen


	The Manitoba government is looking to the local business community to produce a new Manitoba-designed mask to enhance the supply of the personal protective equipment for front-line health-care workers in the fight against COVID-19, Health Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.

	“Our government’s number-one priority is the protection of our most vital service – our health-care system – by ensuring our health-care workers have the protection they need when caring for Manitobans,” said Friesen.  “Medical experts right here in Manitoba have designed a new N95-type mask that is reusable and can provide the necessary protection our front-line workers need.”

	A team of medical experts at Winnipeg’s Health Sciences Centre, led by plastic surgeon Dr. Christian Petropolis, have developed a new type of mask that is reusable and as effective as other, commercially produced N95 masks.  This new made-in-Manitoba mask has a silicone base and uses an N95 or higher grade filter.

	“The mask has a similar design to that of industrial masks.  It is a respirator made of moulded silicone and 3D printed components, and it accepts many available filters as well as a custom-designed reusable filter housing for an N95 or higher disk filter,” explained Petropolis, who is also the program training director for plastic surgery at the University of Manitoba.  “The advantage of this design is its simplicity and flexibility.  The small disk filter uses considerably less N95 material, the main component which has led to a worldwide mask shortage.”

	The province is seeking submissions from local manufacturers who will be able to develop an accelerated process to scale the manufacture of these masks and begin production as soon as possible.  To encourage the mobilization of local manufacturing, the Manitoba government is willing to sign purchase orders totalling up to $15 million to pre-order these innovative, made-in-Manitoba masks.  A portion of these funds may be available in advance to supplement start-up costs.

	“Manitoba is home to an incredible talent bank of innovative thinkers and producers within our manufacturing sector, and I know they will be ready and wanting to step up and help make this happen,” said Friesen.  “With government, medical experts and business working together, we can beat this thing.  I know that together we will continue to find ways to ensure our front-line workers have the protection they need to respond to this public health pandemic.”

	The competition rules and specifications have been made available on www.manitoba.ca/covid19supplies.

STUDENTS AND PARENTS ENCOURAGED TO `E-XPLORE' MANITOBA'S MUSEUMS, WINNIPEG ART GALLERY THROUGH ONLINE TOURS


	Manitoba’s many beloved museums and art galleries have temporarily closed their doors because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but everyone is encouraged to keep enjoying the province’s rich art and cultural experiences by heading online, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox said today.

	 

	“As a mother and a grandmother, I know first-hand how exciting it is to spend time with the family touring the Nonsuch Gallery at the Manitoba Museum or taking a ‘ride’ on one of the vintage tractors at the Manitoba Agricultural Museum,” said Cox. “I applaud the creativity and ingenuity of our museums and art galleries during these challenging times for creating online tours so that Manitobans can safely enjoy all of our wonderful cultural and educational offerings.”

	 

	The Association of Manitoba Museums’ 150 for 150 Exhibit is an online display of 150 artifacts that help tell Manitoba’s stories as part of Canada and before.

	 

	“Museums large and small, rural and urban have contributed to our 150 for 150 online exhibit and it’s something you can explore by yourself or with friends and family,” said Monique Brandt, executive director of Association of Manitoba Museums.  “You can find pictures of artifacts and then ask each other to guess what it is, where it came from, how it was used, etc.  During this time, we’re proud that many museums in Manitoba are offering more online experiences like this to keep people engaged and distracted during self isolation.”

	 

	The exhibit, which coincides with the 150th anniversary of Manitoba becoming a province this year, can be viewed at www.museumsmanitoba.com/150/.

	 

	The Manitoba Museum recently launched ManitobaMuseum@Home, with online experiences at https://manitobamuseum.ca/main/visit/manitobamuseumhome/.

	 

	“Now more than ever we need to stay connected with one another, but in different ways, so until we can see you again, we are bringing the museum to you through ManitobaMuseum@Home,” said Claudette Leclerc.  “ManitobaMuseum@Home is a virtual experience where we’ll share the captivating history of our province, the science that explains our world and the wonders of the universe so that you can enjoy the museum from the comfort of your home.”

	 

	The Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG) is finding new ways to keep the community connected and inspired by launching WAG@Home, which shares art-related content that people can admire from afar, such as My Daily Art, a new series that will share an artwork from the WAG collection every day.

	 

	“Art is one of the most accessible and universal tools we have to learn, communicate and support each other, and in these uncertain and difficult times, the Winnipeg Art Gallery team is looking for ways to help support and uplift Manitobans, every day,” said Stephen Borys, director and CEO.  “We invite everyone to visit our website and social media channels for art-related content that kids, families and adults can enjoy from home.”

	 

	The WAG website, www.wag.ca, also contains Do-It-Yourself videos, hands-on activities and learning opportunities for children and adults.

	 

	Other online cultural offerings include:

	• The Manitoba Agricultural Museum helps immerse visitors in rural Manitoba’s past, providing context to the present and future of agriculture.  The Austin-based museum has an online artifact collection at http://mbagmuseum.ca/collections-exhibits/artifacts-display-filtering.

	• One of the online highlights of the Royal Aviation Museum of Western Canada are the 360-degree cockpit tours that allow the visitor to ‘sit’ in the cockpit or cargo hold of many of the museums aircraft from the comfort of home at: www.royalaviationmuseum.com/virtualcockpits/mobile/index.html.

	• The Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR) has created a new guided virtual tour, and made a number of children’s activities and other content available at ‘Explore the Museum from Home’ at https://humanrights.ca/visit/explore-the-museum-from-home  along with another new feature called ‘Share Your Story’ at https://humanrights.ca/stories/share-your-story#/.

	 

	“I hope everyone will take the opportunity to spend some time visiting online their favourite museum or gallery and also try exploring somewhere new,” said Cox.  “We’re all in this together, Manitoba.”

	•    92 individuals have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba is four.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 962 tests Thursday.  A total of 16,220 tests have been performed since early February.

	A site offering a place for individuals experiencing homelessness to self-isolate opened today in Winnipeg.  The site has 39 units for individuals who have tested positive or are suspected to have COVID-19.  The first 10 units opened today and these are not designed for drop-in or self-referral.  Clients will access these units with a referral from shelter sites, testing sites or care providers within the health system.

	Manitobans should not interpret current case numbers to mean the risk of COVID-19 is reduced.  The current statistics may be a reflection of the effect strict social distancing measures have had and reaffirms that these measures must be continued.  Manitobans are reminded this is not the time to let their guard down.

	Actions taken today will affect case numbers in the weeks ahead.  All Manitobans must remain vigilant to flatten the curve of this virus.  This weekend is normally busy with gatherings for Easter or Passover celebrations.  However, families are reminded that gatherings with anyone from outside your household are strongly discouraged.

	Several community testing sites have altered their hours of operation for the long weekend.  Testing sites in Brandon, Dauphin, Pine Falls and Eriksdale are closed today.

	Sites in Thompson, Flin Flon and The Pas will be open daily through the weekend, with reduced hours of 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.

	Testing sites in Selkirk, Portage la Prairie, Steinbach and Winkler will keep regular hours this weekend.

	In Winnipeg, the Mount Carmel Clinic (886 Main St.) will be closed today and Easter Sunday, while the three other Winnipeg locations will operate as regularly scheduled throughout the long weekend, as will the assessment clinic at St. James Centennial Pool.

PROVINCE ADVISES OUTFLOW FROM SHELLMOUTH RESERVOIR DECREASING


	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre reports the outflow from the Shellmouth Reservoir will be decreasing to 25 cubic feet per second (cfs) from 800 cfs as part of the normal spring operation.

	 

	This will result in a two-to-three foot decrease on the Assiniboine River levels from the Shellmouth dam to Russell.  The effect of the outflow reduction on the level diminishes as the river flows downstream from Russell to Winnipeg. 

	 

	Citizens are advised to stay off the Assiniboine River and all rivers at this time.

	 

	The province will continue to monitor conditions on the upper Assiniboine River as well as downstream river levels. 

	 

	Use of the rivers, lakes, floodways or drainage ditches for activities such as skiing, sledding and snowmobiling could be hazardous at this time and should be avoided.  People living near waterways should be especially careful to prevent children and pets from wandering onto the ice.

	 

	The quality of river ice within communities is also uncertain, so citizens are advised to stay off rivers and retention ponds.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT ADJUSTS PROVINCIAL PARKS OPERATIONS AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  Mental Health Benefit in Being Able to Connect with the Outdoors:  Pallister


	At the advice of Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer, provincial parks will remain open at this time; however, public facilities located within the parks will be closed to ensure social distancing practices are enforced, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“This pandemic has undoubtedly put significant strain and stress on the lives of many Manitobans,” said Pallister.  “There is a great mental health benefit in being able to escape and connect with nature, and we want to do everything we can to help Manitobans navigate this difficult and unprecedented time.”

	In an effort to maintain as much public access as safely possible, provincial parks will remain open.  However, public facilities including washrooms, playgrounds, picnic and group-shelter use will be closed for the foreseeable future, the premier noted.

	Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer continues to stress that Manitobans need to adhere to social distancing practices and should stay home as much as possible to help flatten the COVID curve.

	“At this time, we believe the general use of parks and trails is a low risk activity for Manitobans,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer.  “With the closure of washrooms and other dedicated gathering space within our provincial parks, the opportunity to congregate in groups of more than 10 people is significantly minimized.”

	The province is not ruling out additional measures or further broader park area closures if social distancing becomes problematic, especially in parks close to urban centres, the premier noted.

	Meantime, the Manitoba government has launched its new, online service for the sale of outdoor licences and permits, the premier announced.  The province recognizes this is a significant change in the way Manitobans will access licences and park permits so it will be phased in, starting with hunting and angling licenses as well as provincial park vehicle permits, which are now available online.

	“While we are in an unprecedented time of social distancing and isolation, we recognize that hunting and fishing are important aspects of daily life for many Manitobans across our beautiful province,” said Pallister.  “This enhanced service with the option to purchase these products online supports our continued effort to ensure the health and well-being of all Manitobans during this global health pandemic.”

	Benefits of using an e-licensing approach include:
	•    access 24 hours a day, seven days a week online or by telephone;   
	•    access through participating retailers (list available online);
	•    the ability to immediately purchase and print licenses and permits at home;
	•    the ability to reprint lost or damaged licenses;
	•    receiving email confirmation of licences/permits purchased; and
	•    improved data collection that will support program management.

	In addition to current base licence fees, an administration fee of $4.50 will be included in all licences and permit purchases to support enhanced service delivery, with the exception of the Manitoba Resident Seniors Conservation Angling Licences that will remain free of charge.

	As the weather warms up, Manitobans are encouraged to embrace the outdoors while practising good social distancing when using parks, trails and other public greenspaces, the premier added.

MANITOBA PROVIDES UPDATE ON CHILD-CARE OPTIONS FOR FAMILIES DURING COVID-19 RESPONSE
					  Opened Child-Care Facilities are Heroes Helping Heroes:  Stefanson

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is expanding efforts to connect families with child care, ensuring critical services workers and their children can access child care if they absolutely need it during this difficult time, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“Child-care centres and homes that are opening their doors to children and their families during this challenging time are truly heroes helping heroes,” said Stefanson.  “We continue to call on child-care facilities and early childhood educators to be part of our provincewide response to COVID-19.  Together, we can ensure children can continue to learn and grow in a safe, caring environment as their parents go to work helping those most affected by COVID-19.”

	As of today, more than 1,900 children of health-care and other emergency services workers have been matched with an available space by staff within the Department of Families.  These parents include health-care providers, emergency service providers, corrections workers, law enforcement workers, fire and paramedic workers, and direct social services and child protection workers.  Over the next several days, staff will work to match parents remaining on the waitlist for child care before moving toward the new online system.

	Beginning on Tuesday, April 14, all parents who work in critical services, as defined by the chief provincial public health officer, will be eligible to access child-care spaces available in licensed facilities.  This includes support staff at hospitals and clinics, grocery store staff, farmers and farm workers, construction workers, bank or credit union employees.  Starting Friday, parents working in these sectors who have been unable to make other child-care arrangements will be able to go to www.manitoba.ca/covid19 to see which facilities have spaces and work directly with them to secure child care.

	The minister encouraged licensed child-care facilities that want to help by re-opening or continuing to have spaces available to notify the province by submitting an updated facility status form through Manitoba Child Care Online at www.gov.mb.ca/fs/childcare/index.html.

	The full provincial operating grant, over $30 million, continued to flow to all licensed child-care facilities on April 1.  The Government of Canada has also confirmed that child-care centres are eligible for the federal emergency wage subsidy, which provides up to 75 per cent of employee wages for businesses and non-profits.

	“Our government is providing child-care centres and home-based providers with the support they need to continue operating during this difficult time,” said Stefanson.  “We will continue to do what we can to ensure that vital critical services workers can access child care so that they continue working on the front lines of this pandemic.”

	The Manitoba government also launched an $18-million grant program to help early childhood educators begin independently offering child-care services in their homes or in the community, administered by the Winnipeg and Manitoba chambers of commerce.  Early childhood educators can apply for the grant by filling out the Temporary Child Care Service Grant Form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/temporary-child-care-service-grant/.

	Manitoba continues to follow the advice of the chief provincial public health officer, who has advised that licensed child-care centres can continue to provide services to children as long as the care is limited to no more than 16 children per centre.  Some larger centres with segregated rooms and separate external entrances are able to offer care for up to 16 children per room.  Home-based child-care providers can also continue to operate with up to eight children.

	Manitoba has distributed a COVID-19 practice guideline outlining the hygiene and other recommended measures for child care in Manitoba.  In addition, Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, has provided a circular to all centres advising them of infection prevention protocols during this time and will be available to answer questions from child-care centres and providers next week.  The province is also committed to providing child-care providers with additional supplies and equipment to help prevent the spread of the virus as recommended by public health officials, the minister noted.

	Parents are reminded that children experiencing cold or flu symptoms, have travelled in the last 14 days or who have been exposed to others with a confirmed case of COVID-19 cannot be dropped off at a child-care facility and should remain at home.

	All screening for suspected cases of the virus are to be referred to Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) 1-888-315-9257.  The most up-to-date information on COVID19 can be found at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

NEW MEASURES TO ENFORCE PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC
					  Enhanced Ticketing Capacity and Pre-Set Fines will Protect Manitobans, Help Flatten the Curve:  Premier and Mayor

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government and the City of Winnipeg are working in collaboration for an ‘Operation Safe Apart’ pandemic public health enforcement strategy, including new pre-set fines for individuals or business owners who disregard public health orders, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, Premier Brian Pallister and Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman announced today.

	“Everyone has a role to play in reducing the spread of COVID-19, and the majority of Manitobans are adhering to good social distancing practices and changing how they operate at home, in their community and within their business,” said Pallister.  “Unfortunately, there is still a need to have additional measures in place to address situations where people are ignoring the advice of our health experts.  These changes will give enforcement officers more tools to help curb the spread of the virus.”

	In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the province declared a state of emergency on
	March 20, which included orders under The Public Health Act to help reduce the spread of the virus including:
	•    restrictions on public gatherings to 10 or fewer people,
	•    require the closure of non-essential businesses, and
	•    enforcement of social distancing measures by businesses and services that remain open including ensuring a two-metre distance is kept between people in the facility or premises.

	Effective immediately, fine amounts for breaching these emergency orders will be set at $486 for individuals and $2,542 for businesses.

	Manitoba will be implementing a multi-tiered enforcement approach to enforcing orders, which will include public education, written warning or ultimately, enforcement actions such as ticketing or arrest if necessary, the premier said.

	In Winnipeg, the province is working in close collaboration with the City of Winnipeg, which will utilize Community Service Ambassadors to participate in public education and awareness, with bylaw officer and support from the Winnipeg Police Service (WPS) where required.

	“I want to thank all those who are doing their part by staying home, practising physical distancing and respecting the measures put in place by the Manitoba government,” said Bowman.  “While most in our community are doing their part, there are some who are not getting the message.  I hope education and awareness will be sufficient and enforcement won’t be required but in the event it is, these measures will help protect the safety of Winnipeggers.”

	To support these efforts, Manitoba Justice is partnering with City of Winnipeg to create enforcement units, with WPS acting in an assistance role, in ‘Operation Safe Apart’.  These units will be dedicated to enforcing orders along with providing awareness and prevention, responding to complaints and supporting bylaw enforcement officers.

	In Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made by calling: 311 or by email at 311@winnipeg.ca, or Twitter: @cityofwinnipeg.

	Measures involving public health officers working in conjunction with local police services, First Nation police services and the RCMP are also in place for municipalities outside of Winnipeg.  Plans are underway to expand these and adopt measures similar to those announced today for Winnipeg.  These include engaging municipal bylaw officers, community and First Nation safety officers, community volunteer groups such as Citizens on Patrol, and Manitoba Conservation officers who will work with respective police services.

	Outside of Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made to the Manitoba Government Inquiry (MGI) inquiry line at 204-945-3744, (toll-free) at 1-866-626-4862 or by email at mgi@gov.mb.ca.

	“We must to everything we can to protect our most valuable service – our health-care system –and our most vulnerable citizens,” said Pallister.  “These orders will help save lives and changing how we ensure compliance will help us flatten the COVID curve.”

PROVINCE CREATES WEB PORTAL TO SUPPLEMENT HOME LEARNING RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS
					  New Online Resource Will Grow as Educational Materials are Updated and Added:  Goertzen


	The province is providing a supplemental online resource for Manitoba families whose children are learning at home during the suspension of in-school classes because of COVID-19, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	“This web portal, My Learning at Home/Mon Apprentissage Chez Moi, is a comprehensive resource that will be continually updated for families and caregivers as they support students who are carrying on with their school year and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Goertzen.  “This is a tool to supplement learning, but not to replace the impressive, quality work that teachers are continuing to do remotely for students across the province during this public health emergency.”  

	The My Learning at Home portal will go live online today, providing a resource designed to assist families in supporting the work of teachers as they continue to educate students.  Available in English and French as well as for families in French immersion, My Learning at Home will grow over time as more resources are developed for kindergarten through Grade 12.  In addition, supporting materials for adult learners and for early childhood years will be updated regularly.

	“Learning can be done at home using computers and tablets, allowing parents and caregivers to enhance the education of students with family-centred resources,” said Goertzen. “However, teachers remain the primary guide in helping students learn and meet curriculum expectations.  This online portal is another important tool for teaching and learning.”

	Goertzen noted that parents, caregivers and students are encouraged to be curious and to continue seeking out learning resources.

	The My Learning at Home/Mon Apprentissage Chez Moi portal can be found at www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/mylearning/index.html.

	The provincial Department of Education appreciates the continued assistance and collaboration of school division administrators and trustees, principals, teachers and support staff as they all work with families for the benefit of students across Manitoba during the suspension of in-school classes.  Together, they are helping develop ways for Manitoba students to learn at home to complete the 2019-20 school year.

	Meanwhile, the province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer during the pandemic, and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols and the three Ps – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

PROVINCE ADVISES RED RIVER FLOODWAY TO BE ACTIVATED
					  High Water Warning Issued in Red River Valley:  Schuler


	The province has issued a high water warning for the Red River south of Winnipeg and is preparing to activate the Red River Floodway to manage water levels within the city of Winnipeg, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“As Manitoba prepares for the rising waters of the Red River, we are taking measures to protect properties that could potentially be affected by high water,” said Schuler.  “We could activate the Red River Floodway for the first time in 2020 as early as the evening of Thursday, April 9.”

	Schuler noted standard operating procedure for the floodway gates is to wait until the river ice has broken up and cleared upstream of the floodway inlet.  River ice observations indicate the ice is unlikely to clear until April 9 at the earliest and may occur a day or two later, so those levels will be monitored.

	Water from the Red River began to spill into the Red River Floodway naturally on April 7.  The initial operation is the first of several that will roll the gates off the river bed and push more water into the floodway inlet.  The gates will be raised in stages in accordance with Rule 1 of the floodway operating guidelines, which outlines normal spring operation.

	The province has issued a high water warning for the Red River from Emerson to the Red River Floodway inlet, just south of the city of Winnipeg, as the river is close to spilling its banks in most of the region.  A high water watch has been issued for the Red River from Lockport to Netley Creek due to potential of some overland water in low-lying areas due to ice jamming.

	A warning is issued when river or lake levels are exceeding or are expected to exceed flood stage within the next 24 hours, whereas a watch is issued when river or lake levels are approaching and likely to reach flood stage, but unlikely within the next 24 hours.

	The forecast peak flow of Red River at the floodway inlet, without further significant precipitation, is estimated to be between 68,000 and 74,000 cubic feet per second.  The Red River is forecast to reach levels close to 2006 spring levels between Emerson and Letellier, and between 2006 and 2019 spring levels north of Letellier along the river.

	Water levels are expected to peak at Emerson between April 15 and 20 with the peak expected to reach the Red River Floodway between April 19 and 24.  With the operation of the floodway, the Red River level in Winnipeg at James Avenue is expected to peak between 19 and 19.5 feet between April 13 and 17.

	Provincial crews are deployed in a number of communities in the Red River Valley to prepare for potential ring dike closures.  Dike closures are anticipated over the weekend at West Lynn and Noyse.  Partial dike closures may also be required along PR 201 on the east side of Letellier and at St. Jean Baptiste.  

	The minister is reminding property owners to protect wells as high water rolls through the Red River Valley.  If local sandbagging is required, the province has shared suggested safety measures with municipalities for crews to maintain COVID-19 safety procedures that can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/emo/.

	Water levels along the Assiniboine, Souris and Pembina rivers are relatively low with no significant flooding issues.  The Portage Diversion continues to operate to reduce downstream ice-jam impacts.  Small ice jams may occur in Winnipeg at some of the Assiniboine River bridges.  Major lakes in Manitoba are within normal or desirable operating ranges.

	Updated forecast information is available at www.gov.mb.ca/mit/floodinfo/index.html.

	More information for residents is available at www.gov.mb.ca/flooding/health_safety.html and http://www.manitoba.ca/asset_library/en/spring_outlook/wellwater_safety_factsheet.pdf.

	A new, $5-million COVID-19 research fund through Research Manitoba was announced today by Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen.

	“This new fund will support a clinical trial to determine if a commonly used drug can safely be used as a treatment for COVID-19,” said Friesen.  “The fund will also provide support for local researchers to develop solutions to health-care issues in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”

	In February, following a recommendation from Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health officer, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, with numerous partners, launched a funding opportunity for 10 clinical research professionals to test therapies to mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19.

	“This virus is one of the most serious public health emergencies the world has faced in many years,” said Roussin.  “This fund will ensure important research can take place to help fight this virus and develop new ways to identify and treat patients, as well as develop strong partnerships to move this work forward.”

	“We are proud to partner with Research Manitoba on this important work,” said Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler.  “Agile and innovative thinking is what we need in rapidly evolving times such as these, and investments into research and development will help advance our understanding and ability to treat COVID-19.”

	Local clinical and scientific researchers and senior officials from the Manitoba government, Shared Health and the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority (WRHA) have identified several new research projects.  These include projects to test possible treatments in clinical trials, better understand how the disease is developing in Manitoba and better understand how the health system needs to react to different complications that are emerging around the world.

	“We are pleased to refocus our research efforts on vital clinical trials and potential interventions in the fight against COVID-19,” said Tracey Maconachie, chair, Research Manitoba.  “Our world-renowned partners are conducting leading-edge research that could expedite treatments for Manitobans and all Canadians.”

	More than $3.5 million will be used to support clinical and applied research including $700,000 for Manitoba’s first COVID-19 clinical trial for a drug to fight this virus, the minister said.  The study will test whether or not the drug hydroxychloroquine, used to treat rheumatology issues, can prevent people from contracting COVID-19.  The scientific trial will determine if the drug can safely be used as a treatment for COVID-19.

	“We are building on the work of preliminary studies to look at how this drug could help fight the spread of COVID-19,” said Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, associate professor, department of internal medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, University of Manitoba and department of medical oncology and hematology, CancerCare Manitoba.  “We are asking Manitobans who meet the study’s criteria to consider joining this trial to help us scientifically prove the benefits for Manitobans and people around the world.”

	An additional $500,000 will be invested in partnerships with industry and philanthropic sources supporting existing trials based in Manitoba but with sites across Canada and in seven other countries around the world, Friesen said, adding $1 million will be invested in COVID-19 innovation projects including looking at the development of diagnostic tools.

	The minister noted the development of the fund builds on funding for other research opportunities during the pandemic including:
	•    the University of Manitoba investigating how logistical systems can adapt to a pandemic;
	•    developing a cost-effective, point-of-need diagnostic test for COVID-19 at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health; and
	•    developing a COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Manitoba.

	“While we have learned a great deal about this virus in just a few months, there are many more questions that need to be answered,” said Friesen.  “These investments will help contribute to the world’s understanding of the virus and make important strides toward vaccines, treatments and possible changes to our health system to better combat COVID-19.”

	Manitobans who wish to participate in the clinical trial can visit www.covid-19research.ca for additional details.

	•    12 individuals are currently hospitalized, which includes six individuals in intensive care;
	•    69 individuals have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba is three.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 477 tests Tuesday.  A total of 14,708 tests have been performed since early February.

	Manitobans should not interpret current case numbers to mean the risk is reduced.  The current statistics may be a reflection of the effect strict social distancing measures have had and reaffirms that these measures must be continued.  Manitobans are reminded this is not the time to let their guard down.  Actions taken today will affect case numbers in the weeks ahead.  All Manitobans must remain vigilant to flatten the curve of this virus.  This weekend is normally busy with gatherings for Easter or Passover celebrations.  However, families are reminded that gatherings with anyone from outside your household are strongly discouraged.

	Manitobans are reminded to continue seeking care for regular and chronic medical conditions.  Primary care and community health offices continue to be available for those patients in need of care, with virtual (phone and video) options available as well as in person appointments and walk-in services.

	The first Community COVID-19 Testing Site and Assessment Clinic in Winnipeg opened today at the St. James Assiniboia Centennial Pool and Fitness Centre, 644 Parkdale St.  With the opening of this site, Access Winnipeg West will once again focus on primary care and community health services and no longer be a designated community testing site for COVID 19.

	Assessment clinics for COVID-19 positive patients offer primary care services on an appointment basis for anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or has respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat or shortness of breath.

	In addition to the primary care space, these locations will also serve as designated testing sites in a separate area at the site to support additional capacity for testing.

	Testing sites and assessment clinics will NOT be walk-in services.  People seeking testing should still call Health Links-Info Santé first or be referred by their primary care provider.

MANITOBA TO EXTEND SUPPORTS AND SERVICES TO YOUTH AGING OUT OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM


	As part of its COVID-19 response, the Manitoba government is taking steps to extend supports and services to all young adults who would otherwise age out of the Child and Family Services (CFS) system during this difficult time, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“This pandemic is creating uncertainty for all Manitobans including many youth in our child welfare system,” said Stefanson.  “Our government will ensure young people who would otherwise age out of CFS care have access to continued financial and other support when they turn 18, giving them a greater chance of independence and success beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.  We will work with child welfare authorities and agencies to ensure funding and supports are in place to make this possible.”

	The Manitoba government will continue to extend supports to all youth currently in care who turn 18 between March 20 and Sept. 30.  This includes extending foster care placements and ensuring that youth who choose to move out of foster care continue to receive financial support, the minister noted.  

	Many youth exiting care at the age of majority choose to transition to an Agreement with a Young Adult, which provides continued care and maintenance funding, with the purpose of assisting youth to transition to independence.  These agreements are voluntary and available to young adults up to the age of 21.  Individuals who currently have a voluntary agreement in place will continue to receive this assistance over the same timeframe, regardless of their age.

	Over the next six months, this change could benefit more than 280 youth in care and more than 70 young adults with agreements.

	The minister noted Manitoba Housing will also make 10 additional units available to provide stable, secure housing to young adults who are aging out of care and other youth in contact with the child welfare system.  Building on an existing partnership, these units will be set aside for clients of Resource Assistance for Youth.

	“The steps the government has taken today for youth aging out of care will help us protect at-risk young people during this difficult time,” said Kelly Holmes, executive director, Resource Assistance for Youth.  “We are all in this together and we appreciate the timely response from the government during this time of crisis.”

	A number of other changes have been put in place to support children in care and the child welfare system during the COVID-19 response.  Foster home and residential care licenses will be extended for 60 days, to ensure continuation of care.  The province has activated a mutual aid agreement with child welfare authorities, to help ensure staff and supports are available when they are needed.  The province also continues to share current, accurate information about best practices for children, families, care providers and other partners, based on public health advice.

MAJOR MANITOBA 150 CELEBRATIONS PAUSED FOR 2020
					  Public Health of Manitobans is Our Priority:  Premier

Watch news conference





	Due to the significant public health concerns surrounding COVID-19 and large public gatherings, major Manitoba 150 celebrations are being paused for 2020, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“As Manitobans, we all love our beautiful summers and we were looking forward to celebrating Manitoba’s 150th anniversary, but right now, health and safety must come first,” said Pallister.  “We know this is a difficult time for Manitobans, but we will get through this.  We look forward to the days when we can reunite with our friends and neighbours to keep celebrating our great province.”

	This year marks the 150th anniversary of Manitoba joining Confederation and many activities and events to commemorate this significant milestone were planned by the Manitoba 150 Host Committee Inc.

	All remaining events and public activities associated Manitoba 150 are being postponed, but funding will remain in place to support community projects and events when public health advice advises it is once again safe to hold large public gatherings, said Monique LaCoste and Stuart Murray, co-chairs of the Manitoba 150 Host Committee.

	“We invited Manitobans to be ‘United in Celebration’ in 2020 and instead, we are united in the fight against COVID-19,” said Murray. “Manitoba 150 celebrations may be on hold for now, but we know this pandemic will end, and when it does, we’ll be ready with a celebration like no other.”

	The Unite 150 Concert featuring a full slate of Manitoba artists, originally planned for June 27 at the Manitoba Legislative Building, will be rescheduled in 2021.

	“Once it is safe for Manitobans to gather for Unite 150 under the watchful gaze of the Golden Boy, the theme ‘United in Celebration’ will truly take on its full meaning,” Pallister said.

	Questions about Manitoba 150 programming can be emailed to aimee@manitoba150.com.

	Every year, the Manitoba government provides support to nearly 50 community events and major festivals.

	For organizations under the province’s ‘Community Festivals and Events’ program, that must cancel their events this year due to COVID-19, the province is committed to covering up to 50 per cent of eligible funding.

	“Ensuring funding continues to flow will help ensure these Manitoba’s cultural organizations remain viable into the future,” Pallister said.

	Organizations with questions about events and funding should email artsbranch@gov.mb.ca.

STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS SUSPENDED TO LESSEN COST BURDEN DURING PANDEMIC
					  Post-Secondary Students Need Financial Break Amid Economic Difficulties Created by COVID-19:  Eichler


	The province is suspending repayment of Manitoba Student Aid loans for six months to reduce the financial burden on post-secondary students during the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister and Economic Development and Training Minister Ralph Eichler announced today.

	“During these uncertain times, Manitobans need to pull together to help each other,” said Pallister.  “While people, businesses and organizations across our province co-operate to try to flatten the curve on COVID-19 and reduce its spread, it’s important that our government also do its part to assist those carrying a heavier financial burden during this public health emergency.  With this suspension of loan repayments, we are giving a helping hand to Manitobans who have invested in post-secondary education.”

	Effective April 1, the Department of Economic Development and Training has suspended all repayments of loans under the Manitoba Student Aid Program through Sept. 30.  The temporary stoppage of repayments parallels a similar suspension put in place by the federal government under the Canada Student Loan Program, also through Sept. 30.

	Manitoba Economic Development and Training had been scheduled to receive a total of about $1 million in repayments on April 1 from Manitoba Student Aid borrowers.  The suspension of repayments from April 1 through Sept. 30 will defer the collection of up to $7 million for 2020-21.

	“Manitobans carrying student loan debt have become vulnerable to programming and labour market changes resulting from COVID-19,” said Eichler.  “This deferral of loan repayments is going to significantly lessen the hardship for them, at a time when they really need it.”

	Manitoba Student Aid loan disbursements, including tuition and grant payments, will continue to be made to students as scheduled while repayments are suspended.  During the deferral period, the program will accept payments from borrowers who choose to repay loans through cheque or electronic fund transfers.

	The overall impact of COVID-19 on Manitoba Student Aid will be assessed as the situation evolves.

	Meanwhile, the province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer during the pandemic, and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols and the three Ps – protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.  For more information visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

List of Manitoba government COVID-19 Measures
Letter from Premier Pallister
Letter from Council of the Federation

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government’s recent proposal the federal government borrow on behalf of provincial governments and loan that money to provinces as part of a collective financial response to COVID-19 has received the support of all premiers in a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“I am gratified that all my colleagues support this Provincial Borrowing Initiative being placed immediately before the federal government,” said Pallister.  “All provinces are going to be on the hook for billions and billions of dollars in new debt to pay for health care and economic recovery programs.  This is a sensible and available way Ottawa can make it cheaper for all of us to do so now.”

	Pallister has proposed the federal government create a standing credit mechanism on an urgent basis that would borrow on provinces’ behalf and then lend the money back to provinces on the same terms.  Through the Bank of Canada, Ottawa can borrow in international financial markets at a lower interest rate than individual provinces can, saving hundreds of millions of dollars that can be redirected to health care and economic recovery actions.  Section 18(c) of The Bank of Canada Act states: “The Bank may buy and sell securities issued or guaranteed by Canada or any province.”

	As outlined in the March 26, 2020, letter from Manitoba, the COVID-19 pandemic is undermining essential provincial borrowing capacity in many areas of the country.  The limited credits that can be accessed by provinces and territories is generally at rates much higher than those available to the federal government.  This means billions of dollars will be spent on debt servicing rather than on health care and other essential front-line services, the premier noted.

	The Business Council of Manitoba has also written the prime minister expressing its support for the premier’s initiative.

	“The proposed solution provides increased liquidity and flexibility during this crisis while ensuring the greatest value for money during the recovery and moving forward,” said Bram Strain, president and CEO, Business Council of Manitoba.  “This truly levels the playing field for all jurisdictions and sets a foundation for us to begin to move forward, stronger and together.”

	Manitoba and other provinces are going to hit a financial wall requiring borrowing well beyond anything in the past, the premier said.  With every government competing for the same dollars, federal borrowing on behalf of provinces can give us access to greater financial liquidity in the bond markets at a cheaper cost than provinces doing it solely on their own, he added.

	This year alone, Manitoba expects borrowing needs of up to $10 billion, Pallister said.  This is necessary to support front-line COVID health-care and family expenses, fill the holes created by revenue and bill deferrals with the current fall in economic activity, and pay for ongoing expenses of government, he added.  If Manitoba could save 1.5 per cent on these borrowing costs, that translates to $150 million a year that could be redirected to health care.  Over the 30-year term of those bonds, that translates to over $4 billion of savings for Manitobans for this year’s borrowings alone, the premier stated.  Across all Canadian provinces and territories, this could easily translate into over $100 billion of savings.

	“The federal government has been innovative and responsive in dealing with the fallout from COVID-19 on behalf of Canadians,” said Pallister.  “This is another, increasingly urgent way we can adopt a ‘Team Canada’ approach to fight this pandemic together, as we are doing right here in Manitoba with all our partners, to ensure we all come out of this pandemic stronger and more united than ever.”

PROVINCE PROVIDES RECOMMENDED METHODS FOR SAFE SANDBAG PREPARATION
					  Part of Provincial Response to Challenges of COVID-19:  Schuler


	The province is introducing new safe work procedures that municipalities can implement to ensure the safety of high water response workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler announced today.

	“This spring, we are potentially facing the unique challenge of fighting a high water event while at the same time slowing the spread of COVID-19,” said Schuler.  “We are rising to that challenge and have developed a creative and innovative solution to ensure sandbagging will be undertaken while keeping Manitobans safe.‎”

	A high water response activity document has been created, which provides a clear and concise process on sandbag production, the construction of two types of sandbag dikes, as well as the installation of water-filled barriers.
	 
	The following precautions can be incorporated into sandbag and water-filled barrier procedures:
	•    social distancing with a minimum of six feet or two metres,
	•    availability of adequate hand-washing and washroom facilities,
	•    regular disinfecting of surfaces,
	•    alteration to work methods,
	•    use of appropriate personal protective equipment,
	•    assurance sick workers self-isolate for 14 days, and
	•    preparation for a number of workers to be sick at the same time.

	At provincial worksites, the province may assign specific duties for regular cleaning of common surfaces, tools and facilities.  A co-ordinated approach with the construction industry, suppliers and consultants is underway to ensure the safety of everyone involved in response efforts.

	“As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, all Manitobans have a role to play in slowing its spread and minimizing its impact on the health-care system as well as in communities across the province,” said Schuler.  “We will work together to ensure everyone involved stays safe.”

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES OVER $100 MILLION IN SUPPORT AND RELIEF FOR MANITOBA'S FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19
					  Manitoba Protection Plan Ensures Government Can Respond Quickly and Effectively to Needs of Manitobans:  Pallister


Backgrounder
Background Information

Watch news conference





	The Manitoba government is announcing new measures in the Manitoba Protection Plan to provide extra support and relief to homeowners and businesses, and to enhance health preparedness for new medical equipment and shelter space in the fight against COVID-19, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Our government’s number one priority during this global pandemic is keeping Manitobans safe and ensuring our health-care system is there for us and our loved ones,” said Pallister.  “We must protect our most valuable service – our health-care system – and protect our most vulnerable people, our senior citizens, our homeless, those faced with threats of violence and those who are facing new financial challenges.”

Faster Health Equipment Procurement

	The government is investing more than $100 million to accelerate the pace at which Manitoba is procuring essential medical supplies and equipment, hotel capacity and other critical needs to help prepare for COVID-19.

	“Manitobans have always risen to the challenge and what we’ve seen so far during this pandemic is no exception,” said Pallister.  “This $100-million investment will allow us to support made-in-Manitoba products and solutions from local businesses to quickly help in our collective efforts to fight COVID-19 and protect Manitobans in the weeks and months ahead.”

	Manitoba manufacturers or businesses that are prepared to rapidly scale up production or re-tool manufacturing lines to develop products made in Manitoba to help in the fight against COVID-19 can go to the portal at www.manitoba.ca/covid19, and then visit the business and workplace page.

	The province is also issuing a call to businesses who have a stock of personal protective equipment.  If the equipment is not being used due to closures and physical distancing, they can also reach out by visiting the portal at www.manitoba.ca/covid19.
	 
	In addition, Manitoba businesses can donate unused personal protective equipment supplies in original packaging, clean and in useable condition.  For more info, visit: https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/.

Cash Flow Tax Relief

	Today’s measures will provide immediate relief to Manitobans facing financial challenges by deferring provincial fees and charges, the premier noted.

	As part of the Manitoba Protection Plan, the province is providing the following protections for the next six months until Oct. 1:
	•    instructing Manitoba Hydro, Centra Gas and Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) to not charge interest or penalties in the event that Manitobans are unable to pay at this time;
	•    instructing MPI to relax ordinary practices on policy renewals and collections;
	•    instructing Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries not to charge interest on receivables from restaurants, bars and specialty wine stores;
	•    supporting Workers Compensation Board (WCB) to do the same and asking WCB to extend relief from penalties for late payments;
	•    directing Manitoba Hydro and Centra Gas to not disconnect customers during these times; and
	•    working with municipal partners to ensure municipalities do not charge interest on provincial education taxes and school division fees and the province is encouraging municipalities to do the same with respect to their own taxes and will start discussions to support implementation.

	The government is also deferring provincial income tax and corporate income tax filing deadlines and payments to coincide with the current revised federal deferral of income tax to Aug. 31 and has indicated it would be willing to extend these deferrals until Oct. 1, should the federal government agree, the premier added.

	The new measures are in addition to the recently announced two-month deferral for small businesses that remit up to $10,000 in Manitoba payroll tax or $10,000 in sales tax.  This will result in $80 million in deferred remittance to the province.

	Pallister also announced plans to help make insurance more affordable for Manitobans.  While the province has no ability to allow for deferrals of payments or the waiver of interest charges and penalties, Manitoba is taking steps to make home and business property insurance more affordable to Manitobans by accelerating the removal of $75 million of annual PST from residential and business properties, effective July 1.  

	This will save residential property owners an estimated $38 million per year and business property owners $37 million a year.

Expanded Shelter Capacity  

	The Manitoba government will add more than 140 new shelter beds to support people affected by homelessness and allow for social distancing protocols as part of the province’s broader Manitoba Protection Plan response to COVID-19, the premier announced.

	“While many of us have the capacity to shelter at home, the reality is some of us do not,” said Pallister.  “Through our Manitoba Protection Plan, our government will ensure people who don’t have a stable home have a place to stay safe and healthy as we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic together.”

	Up to $1.2 million will be invested at several locations in Winnipeg to:
	•    repurpose a vacant Manitoba Housing building on Sargent Avenue to create 31 new beds;
	•    add 35 beds provided by the Salvation Army at its Martha Street location;
	•    expand Siloam Mission’s capacity by 50 beds; and
	•    move individuals currently using the Salvation Army’s SonRise Village to alternate locations, making its 26 beds available for new clients.

	The beds at the Sargent Avenue location will be managed by Main Street Project, which is partnering with other shelters to co-ordinate access among their clients.  This location will open today and others will become available as soon as possible.

	The provincial building on Sargent Avenue may also be used as self-isolation units for homeless individuals who need it.

	The premier noted the province is also looking into additional options to support homeless and vulnerable people outside of Winnipeg as part of the province’s Manitoba Protection Plan response to COVID-19.

	“Our government remains committed to looking at every possible way to help all Manitobans through these uncertain times, by providing financial relief and support needed on the front line as we face this global pandemic together.”

	The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and encourages all Manitobans to engage in social distancing protocols.

PROVINCE ADVISES OUTFLOW FROM SHELLMOUTH RESERVOIR INCREASING


	Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre reports the outflow from the Shellmouth Reservoir will be increasing to 800 cubic feet per second (cfs) from 100 cfs as part of the annual reduction from the upper Assiniboine River.

	This will result in a two-to-three foot increase on the Assiniboine River from the Shellmouth to Russell, and one-to-two ft. from Russell to Brandon.  There will be a 0.5-to-one ft. increase as the water reaches Winnipeg in about two weeks.

	The increased outflow will result in potentially hazardous ice conditions from the Shellmouth Reservoir down the Assiniboine River.  Citizens are advised to stay off the river at this time.

	The province will continue to monitor conditions on the upper Assiniboine River as well as downstream river levels.   

	The Hydrologic Forecast Centre is also advising the public of potentially hazardous ice conditions on rivers, lakes and drainage ditches throughout Manitoba as the spring thaw progresses.

	Use of the rivers, lakes, floodways or drainage ditches for activities such as skiing, sledding and snowmobiling could be hazardous at this time and should be avoided.  People living near waterways should be especially careful to prevent children and pets from wandering onto the ice.

	Daily temperatures are warming gradually and are causing ice thickness and strength to deteriorate.  The quality of river ice within communities is also uncertain, so citizens are advised to stay off rivers and retention ponds.

MANITOBA CALLS ON CHILD-CARE PROVIDERS TO HELP OUR HEROES FIGHT COVID-19

	The Manitoba government wants to thank all child-care providers that have stepped up to provide care to the children of health-care and other emergency services workers, and is calling on all child- care providers to help the heroes who are on the front line during the COVID-19 pandemic, Families Minister Heather Stefanson announced today.

	“The early childhood educators and child-care centres that have stepped up to provide child care to health-care and other emergency services workers are truly heroes helping heroes, and I want to thank them for stepping up during this difficult time,” said Stefanson.  “There are still health-care and other emergency services workers who need child care, and today I want to call on child-care providers throughout our province to help those workers as they provide needed services during this pandemic.”

	As of March 31, more than 1,200 children of health-care and other emergency services workers have been matched with an available space.  To support centres so they can re-open during this critical time, the minister noted the first quarter of the provincial operating grant, amounting to nearly $30 million, started flowing to all licensed child-care centres as of April 1.  Licensed child-care facilities that want to help by re-opening or continuing to have spaces available should notify the province by emailing cdcinfo@gov.mb.ca.

	Last month, the government also announced new programs to expand home and community-based child care, including an $18-million grant program to help early childhood educators begin independently offering child-care services at their homes or in the community, administered by the Winnipeg and Manitoba chambers of commerce.  The chambers will also offer business mentorship to early childhood educators looking to open up their homes or other locations in the community to provide child care.  Early childhood educators can apply for the grant by filling out the Temporary Child Care Service Grant Form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/temporary-child-care-service-grant/.

	“It is not too late to step up and help out, whether you are operating in a child-care centre or in your own home,” said Stefanson.  “Our government is providing financial support to child-care centres and early childhood educators during this difficult time, and we will continue to support the child-care sector so that we can help ensure health-care and other emergency services workers can continue working during this pandemic.”

	All child-care centres have also been asked by the province to reimburse parent fees if care has not been provided and to not charge parents to hold spots if they are not being used, the minister added.

	Licensed child-care centres will continue to be limited to 16 spaces to support social distancing and infection prevention measures based on the advice of the chief provincial public health officer.  Some larger centres with segregated rooms and separate external entrances are able to offer care for up to 16 children per room.  This will continue indefinitely in alignment with the decision regarding kindergarten to Grade 12 schools.

	“If you are a front-line health-care or other emergency services worker, we want to hear from you,” said Stefanson.  “Staff will continue working around the clock to ensure that you can get the child care that you need so you can continue working during this pandemic, after which we will be expanding service to all critical services workers as defined by the chief provincial public health officer.”

	Health-care and other emergency services workers can apply for a child-care space by filling out the request form at https://forms.gov.mb.ca/GoMCovid19ESW/.  These parents, which include health-care providers, emergency service providers, corrections workers, law enforcement workers, fire and paramedic workers, and direct social services and child protection workers, should submit their request to be matched with a child-care spot by Wednesday, April 8, so that they can be prioritized for placement.  Families that have already submitted a request do not need to complete the form again, as the province is already working to match them with an available space.

	Beginning on Tuesday, April 14, all parents who work in critical services, as defined by the chief provincial public health officer, will be able to access child-care spaces available in licensed facilities.  This includes support staff at hospitals and clinics, grocery store staff, farmers and farm workers, construction workers, bank or credit union employees.  Parents working in these sectors who have been unable to make other child-care arrangements will be able to check which facilities have available spaces at www.manitoba.ca/covid19 and work directly with them to receive a spot.

	The listing of critical services, as authorized under The Public Health Act, is available at:

	Public health officials advise 40 additional cases of COVID-19 have been identified as of 9:30 a.m., bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 167 at this time.

	The data also shows:
	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized including four in intensive care,
	•    11 individuals have recovered from COVID-19, and
	•    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba remains at one.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 1,300 tests Wednesday.  As of April 2, a total of 11,327 tests have been performed.

	Three additional staff across two Manitoba health-care facilities have tested positive for COVID-19.  The confirmed cases, at Health Sciences Centre (HSC) Winnipeg and Betel Home Gimli are being investigated by public health, occupational health and infection prevention and control officials.  All affected health-care workers are being provided with appropriate direction related to self-isolation or self-monitoring, depending on their exposure.

	As a result of the positive COVID-19 case at Betel Home in Gimli, public health officials are also investigating a respiratory illness outbreak among residents there.  Nine residents showing symptoms of respiratory illness are being tested for the cause of their illnesses.  This will include testing for COVID-19.  The home has implemented additional infection prevention and control measures to isolate affected patients.

	A change in protocol will soon require health-care workers working in patient care roles at facilities, including at hospitals, long-term care facilities, health centres, nursing stations, Access Centres and COVID-19 testing locations, to expand their use of procedure masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE).  These changes will be implemented over the coming days at sites across the province.  Manitoba’s provincial COVID-19 central supply chain management is working with regions and facilities to identify and ship appropriate PPE.

	New screening procedures are being implemented for staff working in acute and long-term care facilities.  Implementation of these measures has begun and will involve asking staff about travel history, exposure to COVID-19 positive cases, any symptoms they may have and having their temperature taken at the start of their shift.  Staff who are required to come and go during the course of their shift may be re-screened upon re-entry into facilities and service areas.

	Public health is also advising that people remain within or close to their home communities.  This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only.  Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

	As Manitoba’s health system continues with preparations to ensure it is prepared to meet the needs of patients and to ensure appropriate protection from COVID-19 is available to health-care workers, donations of the following supplies are now welcome:
	•    N95 respirators of various models and sizes, both hospital and industrial grade;
	•    surgical/procedure masks;
	•    gloves;
	•    disposable gowns; and
	•    disinfectants and cleaners.

	Supplies must be in original packaging, clean and in useable condition.  Expired supplies will not be accepted.
	 
	For more information on donating supplies, visit https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/supply-donations/ or call (toll-free) 1-833-408-0101.

	In order to meet continued demands of Winnipeggers for COVID-19 screening, a second community testing drive-thru site will open tomorrow at the Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) Main Street service centre, 1284 Main St.  Hours of operation will be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.

	Other Winnipeg locations include:
	•    Mount Carmel Clinic, 886 Main St.,
	•    Access Winnipeg West, 280 Booth Dr., and
	•    MPI’s Bison Drive Service Centre, 15 Barnes St.

	The new Main Street location will allow testing sites at Access Transcona and Access Fort Garry to stop operating as testing sites tomorrow and return to their mandate of providing primary and episodic care to patients.  The public is reminded that a referral to these testing sites is needed and they are not walk-in clinics.  Information on locations and hours of operation throughout Manitoba is available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

PROVINCE ANNOUNCES INITIATIVES IN SUPPORT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH
					  Manitoba Government Partnering with Community to Develop Awareness Campaign on Non-Consensual Distribution of Intimate Images:  Minister


	The Manitoba government is introducing new online resources and supports for victims as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Sport, Culture and Heritage Minister Cathy Cox, minister responsible for status of women, announced today.

	“Sexual violence and sexual assault is traumatic and has severe, long-lasting effects for survivors,” said Cox.  “We are committed to ensuring greater supports using all available technologies, such as online, which are more important than ever given the global health situation and the need for Manitobans to stay at home to help flatten the curve.”

	The province will work in partnership with community experts, including the Shameless Circle and the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, to develop public awareness material about the non-consensual distribution of intimate images, the minister said.  

	“During these unprecedented times and higher than usual online connectivity, it is essential that we work together to educate the public on the harm and ongoing trauma associated with the sharing of intimate images,” said Signy Arnason, associate executive director, Canadian Centre for Child Protection.  “As the designated agency to receive and respond to victims impacted by the non-consensual distribution of an intimate image, we are pleased to be working with the province of Manitoba on this important awareness campaign.”

	The Shameless Circle is a volunteer-led healing circle for women aiming to end stigma around women standing up for themselves and their children.
	 
	“Education and awareness is key when it comes to internet safety, for kids and adults alike.  This is why the Shameless Circle team of volunteers are working so hard to combat this particular issue of non consensual distribution of intimate images – this is an important issue that needs to be addressed at all fronts,” Sara Usman, co-founder of the Shameless Circle.  “We look forward to partnering with the Manitoba government on this important initiative.”

	Cox noted the province has also partnered with Ka Ni Kanichihk to develop a brochure about third-party reporting, which will be available on www.gov.mb.ca/youarenotalone/ in the coming months.  Third-party reporting offers adult survivors the option of reporting the details of their cases anonymously to the RCMP or Winnipeg Police Service through a third-party, community-based victim support agency, if they are not ready to participate in a police investigation or become involved in court proceedings.

	In cases that do proceed to court, Manitoba Justice will be launching new testimonial aids for victims, including ‘soft’ rooms with video-conferencing technology that enable remote testimony, the minister said.  These spaces are designed to provide a comfortable, safe environment to testify, which can protect victims against some of the traumatizing impacts of the court process.  They will be located in several Manitoba Justice Victim Services’ offices around the province.

	The province will use social media to share information about available supports and resources throughout the month of April, and Manitobans can participate in the discussion using the hashtags #SAAM2020, #SupportSurvivors and #YouAreNotAlone.

	In addition, the Manitoba government’s You Are Not Alone webpage is updated regularly and Manitobans are encouraged to go to www.gov.mb.ca/youarenotalone/ for more information on available supports, health information, police information and information on consent.

	If you are in need of support, the Sexual Assault Crisis Line can be reached at 204-786-8631 and (toll-free) in Manitoba at 1-888-292-7565.

	Public health officials advise 24 additional cases of COVID-19 have been identified as of 9:30 a.m., bringing the total number of lab-confirmed positive and probable positive cases in Manitoba to 127 at this time.

	The data also shows:
	•    four individuals are currently hospitalized including three in intensive care;
	•    four individuals have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba remains at one.

	Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 1,130 tests Tuesday.  As of April 1, a total of 10,044 tests have been performed.

	New screening procedures are being implemented for staff working in acute and long-term care facilities.  Implementation of these measures will begin today and will involve all staff arriving for the start of their shift to have their temperature taken and be required to answer questions about any symptoms they have, their travel history and their exposure to positive COVID-19 cases.  Staff who are required to come and go during the course of their shift may be re-screened upon re-entry into facilities and service areas.

	Under The Public Health Act, new public health orders announced earlier this week take effect today.  In addition, the chief provincial public health officer has clarified a public health order to ensure a better understanding for businesses classified as not providing critical services and how they are able to operate during the state of emergency.

	All non-exempt businesses may:
	•    continue to operate where customers can order goods online or by telephone; however, customers cannot attend the businesses’ premises or property to order goods;
	•    continue to sell goods to customers where those goods can be picked up ‘curbside’ or delivered to customers; however, customers cannot pick up goods at businesses’ premises or on its property;
	•    allow staff to attend the businesses’ premises, without a limitation on the number of staff, as long as staff take measures to keep social distancing of one to two metres apart from each other; and
	•    accept delivery of goods and may allow services, such as construction, repairs, maintenance and cleaning to occur at their premises and on their property.

	Additional details are available at https://engagemb.ca/.

	Manitoba Justice continues to take steps to reduce the spread of infection and enhance access to justice throughout the province.  As of April 2, new admissions to all adult and youth correctional centres in Manitoba will be handled through the Winnipeg Remand Centre (WRC).  All individuals coming into custody will be isolated for up to 14 days to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 into facilities.  Sheriff services will be assisting rural police agencies with transports whenever possible.  All in-person visits for people in Manitoba’s adult and youth correctional centres have been suspended including inmate programs, staff training and other group activities.

	The province is expanding the number of free phone calls for individuals in custody to help them maintain contact with their support systems.  Lawyers are encouraged to meet with clients remotely, whenever possible, but in-person visits with clients can continue at all facilities, with the exception of the WRC.  Cleaning procedures in all Manitoba’s correctional centres have increased significantly including the use of fogging equipment to disinfect large and high-traffic areas.  Protocols for the use of personal protective equipment are in place to ensure the safety of staff and inmates.

	As of April 2, greater access to bail hearings on evenings and weekends will increase the efficiency of the system, ensure timely bail and other hearings and limit unnecessary admissions to the WRC.  Crown attorneys will work on evenings, overnight and on weekends for consultations and hearings and to work with defence counsel on sentencing recommendations.  The province is also working with police agencies to expand remote bail hearings in the north.  The number of court hearings that can be held by phone will also be increased to avoid unnecessary transportation of people out of their communities.

	Public health is also advising that people remain within or close to their home communities.  This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only.  Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

	As Manitoba’s health system continues with preparations to ensure it is prepared to meet the needs of patients and to ensure appropriate protection from COVID-19 is available to health-care workers, donations of the following supplies are now welcome:
	•    N95 respirators of various models and sizes, both hospital and industrial grade;
	•    surgical/procedure masks;
	•    gloves;
	•    disposable gowns; and
	•    disinfectants and cleaners.

	Supplies must be in original packaging, clean and in useable condition.  Expired supplies are not able to be accepted.

					  Taking Steps to Add Former Registered Nurses to Support Colleagues Under These Extraordinary Circumstances:  Friesen


Backgrounder
Background Information

Watch news conference





	Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen is issuing an order under The Regulated Health Professions Act to enable the registrar of the College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba to waive or modify registration requirements for former registered nurses, allowing them to apply for temporary registration during the pandemic on an expedited basis.

	“We know the pandemic will place additional strain on the health-care system, and we’re making this regulatory change to ensure former nurses can be called upon to bolster the number of nurses in our hospitals, personal care homes and clinics to provide services to patients,” said Friesen.  “I want to thank the College of Registered Nurses and their registrants for working with us to make sure we can prepare for the challenges we face and ensure the safe care of Manitoba patients.”

	Former registrants of the college seeking information on temporary registration requirements should visit https://www.crnm.mb.ca/about/covid-19.  In addition, application and registration fees will be waived for former registrants applying for temporary registration via this process.

	“We are thankful for the support of our colleagues in government enabling a more nimble response in Manitoba to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic,” said Katherine Stansfield, CEO and registrar, College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba.  “This is a great opportunity for former registered nurses to continue to make a contribution to the health of Manitobans during this critical time.”

	The minister noted the order will remain in place until there is no longer a serious and immediate threat to public health.

	“We know many former registered nurses have already contacted us offering support to their colleagues during this very difficult time,” said Friesen.  “By coming together and taking the right steps, we can make a real difference and help the health-care system be prepared for the hard work ahead.”

	The minister noted this step builds on other recent investments to support the health system including funding for research opportunities during the pandemic.

	The Manitoba government is investing $800,000 and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) is investing more than $465,000 in three research projects including:
	•    investigating how logistical systems can adapt to a pandemic at the University of Manitoba;
	•    developing a cost-effective, point-of-need diagnostic test for COVID-19 at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health; and
	•    developing a COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Manitoba.

	In addition, the province’s first COVID-19 clinical trial for a drug is underway.  The study will test if a rheumatological drug known as hydroxychloroquine can prevent people from contracting COVID-19.  The scientific trial will determine if the drug can safely be used as a treatment for COVID-19.

	People who are eligible are:
	•    people who have tested positive for COVID-19,
	•    people who live with individuals who test positive, and
	•    health-care workers who were exposed to patients with confirmed positive infection.

	Manitobans who meet these criteria and wish to participate in the clinical trial should visit:
www.covid-19research.ca.

MANITOBA GOVERNMENT MAINTAINING FUNDING FOR MUNICIPALITIES
					  Provide Certainty to Local Governments to Help Maintain Critical Essential Services to Their Citizens: Pallister


	The province will ensure critical funding to Manitoba municipalities remains intact during the unprecedented economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“As Manitobans, we are all facing tough times and I want to make one thing very clear – we are committed to maintaining our funding to municipalities as promised in Budget 2020,” said Pallister. “This is in spite of unprecedented financial pressure on the provincial government, but we want to provide certainty to municipalities to help maintain critical essential services such as emergency personnel.”

	The province provides a total of $172.6 million in operating funding to municipalities as well a total of $137 million in municipal infrastructure funding.

	Following Wednesday’s release of Restoring Safe Services: Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap to Recovery, the premier hosted a series of socially distanced meetings and tele-conferences to discuss the front-line fight against the pandemic with municipal leaders from across Manitoba.  

	“Manitobans are resilient and it is heartwarming to witness the way our communities band together in times of crisis,” said Pallister. “We will beat this pandemic together and will come out stronger for it.”

	Full details on the plan are available at www.manitoba.ca/restoringsafeservices and businesses with questions on restoring their services should visit https://engagemb.ca/.

	Maintaining critical funding to municipalities is one of the ways the provincial government continues to directly support Manitoba communities. In March, the province announced nearly $8 million in one-time funding for spring flood preparedness projects in 83 municipalities.

	Manitoba has invested more than $900 million under the Manitoba Protection Plan in the fight against COVID-19. In addition, the province has announced a number of measures in order to provide financial relief for Manitobans including:
	•    Ensuring up to $110 million is returned to Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) policyholders. Rebates are expected to be around 11 per cent, or between $140 to $160 per average policyholder.
	•    Providing up to $120 million to support Manitoba’s small and medium-sized businesses through the Manitoba Gap Protection Program (MGPP). The province will advance each eligible business the non-interest bearing forgivable MGPP loan of $6,000, for a total of up to $120 million.
	•    Returning the $37-million Workers Compensation Board (WCB) surplus to eligible Manitoba employers. This month, eligible employers will receive a credit to their account based on 20 per cent of their 2019 premium. WCB expects $29 million will be returned to the private sector, with approximately $7 million going to small businesses in Manitoba.

MANITOBA LEGISLATURE TO RESUME ON LIMITED BASIS WHILE FOLLOWING PUBLIC HEALTH REQUIREMENTS FOR COVID-19


	The Manitoba legislature will reconvene on Wednesday, May 6, to resume the legislative session on a limited schedule after it had been adjourned March 19 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, government house leader Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

	“As Manitoba gradually begins to reopen next week, our government will do the same to resume the second session of the province’s 42nd legislature,” said Goertzen. “Physical distancing measures will be in place in the legislative chamber, and all members of the legislative assembly will be required to comply with all relevant public health directives in place at that time.”

	One sitting day will be held each week throughout May, on the 6th, 13th, 20th and 27th of the month. These sittings will proceed on a schedule as they would normally, with a question period at 1:30 p.m. and debate on government business in the afternoon.

	A reduced number of members will be in the chamber to participate at any given time, in accordance with public health requirements as ordered by Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer. Some logistical details continue to be worked out including the form that virtual legislative sittings might take with members possibly participating through video and/or audio links. A potential virtual sitting option is being led by the office of the Speaker of the assembly.

	“We recognize it is important to allow the opposition to fulfil its role regarding its questions of the government, as well as to protect the health of all members by limiting large gatherings,” said Goertzen.

	In addition to regular sittings in the chamber, meetings of the Standing Committee on Crown Corporations will be scheduled for May 28, June 4 and June 11. Discussions are also proceeding toward scheduling a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee.

PROVINCE TO HOLD PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON PARAMEDIC SELF-REGULATION AMENDMENTS


	The Manitoba government is holding public consultations to support legislative changes that would transition paramedics and emergency medical responders to self-regulation under The Regulated Health Professions Act, Health, Seniors and Active Living Minister Cameron Friesen announced today.  

	“Our government committed in 2016 to establish paramedicine as a self-regulated health profession to improve the quality of care provided to Manitobans,” said Friesen. “The move to self regulation will also support the professional growth of paramedics and increase transparency in the regulation of the profession. I encourage the public to take part in this consultation.”

	The amendments to the regulation would transition paramedics and emergency medical responders to work under regulations outlined by the College of Paramedics of Manitoba, and would set out the categories of procedures that members of the profession are authorized to perform.

	Currently, paramedicine is not a self-regulating profession like other health professions. Instead, paramedics and emergency medical responders are licensed by Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL) under The Emergency Medical Response and Stretcher Transportation Act. The Practice of Paramedicine Regulation was enacted on June 1, 2018, to:  
	•    designate the profession of paramedicine as a regulated health profession,
	•    establish the College of Paramedics of Manitoba, and
	•    set out the scope of practice of the profession.

	In addition, the Council of the College of Paramedics is seeking public feedback on a proposed College of Paramedics of Manitoba General Regulation.

	“We are appreciative of the opportunity for the public consultation to commence. We value the opinion of the public, paramedics, and other stakeholders related to the proposed regulation,” said Trish Bergal, executive director/registrar, College of Paramedics of Manitoba. “This is an important step to becoming a self-regulated profession in Manitoba.”

	This regulation defines who is able to register with the college and practice as a paramedic or an emergency medical responder, defines what type of health-care procedures paramedics can perform and the terms and conditions on the performance of those procedures, and sets out standards of practice for the profession and continuing competency requirements.

	Due to COVID-19 and restrictions under current public health orders, the public is encouraged to review the proposed amendments and provide feedback online until June 29.

	The data also shows:
	•    five individuals are currently hospitalized, with no individuals in intensive care;
	•    38 active cases and 235 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19; and
	•    the number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains at six.

	As of yesterday, an additional 689 laboratory tests were performed. This brings the total number of tests performed since early February to 25,402.

	Public health orders restricting staff from working in more than one licensed personal care home (PCH) have been signed and will take effect today. The single-site restriction is intended to provide additional protection against the introduction and/or spread of the COVID-19 virus within PCHs.

	In recognition of the vulnerability of the PCH population to severe illness and/or death related to the virus, provincial planning has been underway to ensure the change is able to be implemented quickly while ensuring stable staffing and service continuity. As of today, all of Manitoba’s 127 licensed PCHs have confirmed readiness, with staff in place.

	It is important to note that while some gradual lifting of restrictions has begun, significant work to limit the spread of COVID-19 must continue. Public health officials are also advising people to remain within or close to their home communities. The request to stay home as much as possible is still in place at this time. This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba and neighbouring jurisdictions, to essential trips only.

	The province is also launching an education campaign on being ‘COVID careful’ in cottage country to remind all campers and cottagers that COVID-19 guidelines must be followed. The goal is to raise awareness and encourage Manitobans to do the same within their social networks by posting supportive educational messages.

	The campaign will include portable signs and education stops on key highway routes, new materials that can be displayed in car and cottage windows, as well as a social media campaign, all designed to show that cottagers in provincial parks and across the province are aware of their responsibilities and are encouraging others to stay mindful.

	A secure online portal is being established to allow Manitobans who have been tested for COVID-19 to more quickly access their negative test results. Starting next week, when people are tested they will receive information about how to register and access these results. Users will need a Manitoba health registration card in order to access their results online.

	A toll-free number will be available early next week to provide results to those without a Manitoba health card or those without internet access. As always, public health officials will directly notify Manitobans who have tested positive for COVID-19.

	A new drive-thru community testing site opened today in Swan River, at the Manitoba Public Insurance facility, 125 Fourth Ave. North. Hours of operation are daily from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. This is Manitoba’s 16th community testing site and ninth drive-thru location.

	Additionally, work is underway to get a new testing site established at Thunderbird House to support access to testing for Winnipeg’s homeless and shelter populations, as well as a new mobile service available in the next two weeks to serve clients with limited mobility.

PROVINCE OPENS ONLINE INTAKE FOR $120-MILLION MANITOBA GAP PROTECTION PROGRAM
					  Businesses Impacted by COVID-19 Encouraged to Apply to Receive $6,000: Pallister


	The provincial government’s online portal to facilitate business applications to the Manitoba Gap Protection Program (MGPP) is now live, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

	“Many Manitoba small and medium-sized businesses are facing significant pressures brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we want to help them through this challenging time,” said Pallister. “We created a Manitoba solution to bridge the gap for approximately 20,000 businesses that don’t qualify for the federal funding announced in response to COVID-19, to make sure some relief is available to local businesses so they can minimize layoffs, hire staff back and prepare to safely restore the services they offer to Manitobans.”

	The premier announced the $120-million MGPP last week and noted staff worked hard to get a website up and running so Manitoba businesses can submit applications for funding. The MGPP provides an interest-free, forgivable $6,000 loan to small and medium-sized businesses in Manitoba that have experienced hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health orders. Loans are available to businesses that fail to qualify for the various federal government assistance programs and wage subsidies created because of COVID-19.

	Eligible businesses will receive a one-time, lump-sum payment of $6,000, electronically deposited into their business bank account.

	“Our government has been working with Manitoba’s business sector to identify the greatest need and target our support to businesses harmed by the pandemic and its fallout,” said Pallister. “We are working with our partners to ensure we make the right decisions at the right time so we can provide maximum opportunities for recovery for the benefit of all Manitobans.”

	Permanent, Manitoba-based businesses that were operational in the province on March 20 (the date the Manitoba government declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19) are eligible to apply if they temporarily ceased or curtailed operations as a result of a COVID-19 public health order, which harmed their business in Manitoba. Businesses must not have received federal government COVID-19 grant funding support, and do not intend to apply for and receive previously announced federal government COVID-19 non-repayable funding support.

	Eligible businesses are now able to submit online applications forms at https://manitoba.ca/covid19/business/mgpp.html. To apply online, applicants must have:
	•    a valid Manitoba Business Number;
	•    a Companies Office registry number;
	•    good standing with the Companies Office;
	•    Manitoba Workers Compensation Board and Manitoba Retail Sales Tax account numbers, if applicable;
	•    the sole proprietor’s social insurance number (SIN) as well as one other partner’s SIN (if the business is a partnership);
	•    business email address; and
	•    business bank account information for purposes of depositing the payment.

	The full form and list of eligibility criteria is available online. Individuals that require assistance in completing the online form can contact the Manitoba Economic Support Centre (toll-free) at 1-888-805-7554.
	 
	The province’s goal is to provide a $6,000 deposit to eligible businesses within a few days of applying online, the premier added.

	The application deadline for MGPP is July 31.

					  Manitobans and Outdoor Enthusiasts Reminded to Continue Responsible Social Distancing While Enjoying the Great Outdoors in Provincial Parks: Guillemard


	Reservations for Manitoba campgrounds open next week and staggered dates will be offered to make it easier for outdoor enthusiasts to book a site at their favourite campground, Conservation and Climate Minister Sarah Guillemard announced today.

	“We thank Manitobans for their commitment in acting on the advice our health-care experts to stay home for the benefits of themselves, their loved ones and their community,” said Guillemard. “It is through their dedication and actions that we are able to allow Manitobans to continue to visit our provincial parks, and we are pleased to open up our campgrounds for the season, with additional safety measures in place. I believe this is welcome news for many Manitobans and their families.

	“I encourage everyone to keep practicing the fundamentals of good hygiene and social distancing while at home, and especially while enjoying some quality time outside with their loved ones, whether camping, at the cottage and throughout our beautiful parks.”

	Manitobans are reminded to take advantage of the new opportunity to buy a park vehicle pass online as part of the province’s new e-licensing program that launched earlier this year.

	To accommodate the expected high demand on the opening day of the parks reservation system, online and call centre services will begin at 7 a.m. at http://prs.gov.mb.ca, 204-948-3333 (in Winnipeg) or 1 888-482-2267 (toll free). Check the website for call centre hours on other days. Customers making online reservations are advised to check their user IDs and passwords prior to May 4. For more information, visit www.manitobaparks.com.

	The Manitoba Parks Reservation Service will accept bookings in two phases:
	•    May 4 at 7 a.m. campsite reservations open for Winnipeg Beach, Betula Lake, Big Whiteshell, Brereton Lake, Caddy Lake, Falcon Beach, Falcon Lakeshore, Nutimik Lake, Opapiskaw, Otter Falls, West Hawk Lake and White Lake campgrounds; and
	•    May 6 at 7 a.m. campsite reservations open for all remaining provincial park campgrounds.

	As part of Restoring Safe Services:  Manitoba’s Pandemic and Economic Roadmap for Recovery, additional measures will be in place and enforceable under the public health order, the minister noted. Campers are reminded that current public health orders limit gatherings to 10 people or less and people must continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing protocols. Provincial parks will implement enhanced cleaning procedures and sanitization of public washrooms and shower facilities in the campgrounds. Staff will be monitoring to ensure social distancing is adhered to, especially in public areas like beaches and recreation areas. For more information visit www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/restoring/phase-one.html#parks. 

	In addition, campers are reminded there is currently a travel ban north of the 53rd parallel, with certain exceptions for essential travel. While the ban is in effect, anyone from southern Manitoba should not be travelling to a campground in the north. If making a booking for a northern campground (anywhere north of Lake Winnipeg), confirm the travel ban has been lifted prior to the planned camping trip. Out of province campers and visitors must follow the public health orders related to travel including a requirement to self-isolate for 14 days when entering the province.

	Walk-in reservations and in-person payment arrangements can be made at 200 Saulteaux Cres. in Winnipeg and will be available Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. beginning May 4 for the parks and facilities described above. Be aware that public access to the building is limited due to COVID-19 protocols and may require queuing outside. Online or call centre reservations are preferred.
