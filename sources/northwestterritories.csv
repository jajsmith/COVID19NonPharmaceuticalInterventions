4,2020-10-08,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/masks-required-nwt-airport-terminal-buildings,Government Website,Masks required in NWT airport terminal buildings,"Effective October 13, 2020, travellers and employees will be required to wear a mask while inside Northwest Territories (NWT) airport terminal buildings. Until this requirement comes into effect, the public is still encouraged to wear masks within our airport facilities.  As passenger traffic continues to increase, this requirement will help keep travellers and employees safe amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Travellers are already required to wear a mask while going through security and/or to board a flight. This Transport Canada regulation came into effect on April 20, 2020.  Travellers are responsible for ensuring they are in compliance with the federal government measures prior to travelling. The public is encouraged to bring their own mask; however, if an individual does not have their own mask, there may be some available for use at our airports. You will not be required to wear a mask if you have medical reasons that make it unsafe for you. The following other exemptions also apply: ·       Individuals unable to remove their mask without assistance. ·       Children under the age of two.  ·       Individuals authorized by security, airline staff or airport staff to remove their mask for identification purposes.  ·       Individuals will be allowed to temporarily remove their mask to eat, drink or take oral medications. The use of a mask is recommended by the Chief Public Health Officer as a way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to protect others. It is especially recommended when it is not possible to consistently maintain a two-metre physical distance from others, particularly in public settings such as airports. Wearing a mask does not replace other protective measures including physical distancing, hand washing, covering a cough or sneeze, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, self-monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms, and staying home when sick.  A reminder that until further notice, only passengers, employees and service staff are permitted inside Northwest Territories’ airports. Those who are dropping someone off or picking someone up may not enter the terminal.   Quote “While the best way to protect yourself and your community is to stay at home and not travel outside of the NWT, we want to ensure that people who need to travel, as well as airport staff, are safe in our airports.  The health and safety of NWT residents and communities is our main priority and we ask and thank passengers for their cooperation.”  - Diane Archie, Minister of Infrastructure     Quick facts ·       The GNWT operates and maintains 27 airports across the NWT. ·       The requirement to wear masks will be effective as of October 13, 2020.   Related links ·       List of NWT airports ·       Transport Canada regulation ·       GNWT's Response to COVID-19 information on air travel      For media requests, please contact: Public Affairs and Communications Department of Infrastructure Government of the Northwest Territories INF_Communications@gov.nt.ca"
5,2020-10-08,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/halloween-guidelines-released-nwt,Government Website,Halloween Guidelines Released for the NWT,"Trick-or-treating is on this year and the Government of the Northwest Territories has released guidelines on how to celebrate safely.  The guidelines provide “must-do’s” based on continued public health orders in the territory; things to avoid; and best practices to stay safe for trick-or-treaters and treat-givers.    Key guidance on trick-or-treating includes:  ·       Trick-or-treat in outdoor spaces as much as possible.  ·       Wash your hands often. This is especially important: o   before and after handling your non-medical mask or face covering; o   after touching frequently touched surfaces (i.e., door bells); o   when you arrive home from trick-or-treating; and  o   before and after handling or eating treats. Keep your trick-or-treating partners to your household and Friendship Circle – the five people you like to spend time with most.    Keep interactions brief at homes when getting treats. When approaching houses, take turns one at a time at the door and stay six feet or two metres from others.  ·       Keep mittens on the whole time you trick or treat. Once home, wash mittens and costumes. Wash your hands for 20 seconds. Do not touch your face with the mittens. Haunted houses are challenging settings during a pandemic. This activity requires extra work as haunted houses are made for screaming – and screaming produces a lot of respiratory droplets. That comes with much greater risk than trick-or-treating.    Things to consider for haunted houses:  ·       Holding outdoors is always best: If an open-air setting is possible, it will be safer ·       Allowing for physical distancing: try using glow-in-the-dark physical distancing markers on the floor/ground to keep people at-least two metres (six feet) apart. If it’s possible, it would be better to do four metres. Bigger spaces are always best.  ·       Have a sign-in sheet: keep track of everyone who comes with contact information in case contact tracing is required. ·       Patrons, staff/volunteers use of non-medical masks: requiring non-medical masks will help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling a long distance.  ·       You must control crowds: No more than 25 people can be indoors – and physical distancing must be maintained. Proprietors are responsible.  ·       Hand-washing supplies are a must: Keep them on-site and stocked, and encourage guests to wash their hands frequently.  ·       Have people go through by household wherever possible: Less mixing is always better.   Residents are reminded that anyone who is required to self-isolate for any reason will not be able to participate in:  ·       Trick-or-treating ·       Treat-giving ·       Haunted houses ·       Gatherings of any kind   Full guidelines are available on the GNWT’s COVID-19 response website (link below), including a print-ready document.    Quote(s) “The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenging time, especially when it has created barriers to social interaction, particularly for young people in the NWT. Being able to celebrate Halloween is important for our territory’s social and mental well-being. While Halloween will look a little bit different this year, I know our territory is resilient and creative and I look forward to seeing how families, friends, and especially kids bring that creativity to life, while keeping each other safe during our first pandemic Halloween.”  - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services     Quick facts ·       Trick-or-treating done outside is a generally low-risk activity so long as the right precautions are taken.  ·       If any plans require gathering limits under Emerging Wisely to be exceeded, a plan to mitigate risk must be submitted to Protect NWT for approval by the Chief Public Health Officer.  ·       Gatherings where many different people mix are a significant source of recent outbreaks across Canada. The Halloween guidelines are designed to help limit these risks – but there will never be no risk.

8,2020-10-06,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/nwt-experiences-lower-usual-wildfire-season-2020,Government Website,NWT experiences lower than usual wildfire season in 2020,"A below-average fire season saw 70 wildfires burn 21,139 hectares across the Northwest Territories (NWT) in 2020—less than half as many fires as last year, and only a fifth of the area burned in 2019. Wet weather limited the number of fires and the area burned, with most regions of the NWT experiencing more rain than forecasted. The only exceptions were the Beaufort-Delta and the North Slave regions, which experienced higher than average fire risk throughout the fire season.  The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) made several adjustments to its fire operations in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Training and fitness testing were modified to limit group sizes and potential exposure, an additional air tanker group and more fire fighters were hired, an ignition task team was established and detection efforts were increased. While fire is a natural and important part of the ecosystem, keeping fires small was a priority this year. Due to the risk of COVID-19, it was critical to avoid large-scale suppression efforts that could require the GNWT call on southern firefighters for support or require the evacuation of small communities. We focused on providing an early and aggressive response to all wildfires. As a result, nearly two thirds of all fires were fought this year—twice as many as usual. The GNWT would like to acknowledge the extra efforts of wildfire personnel during COVID-19 to protect the health and safety of our fire crews and communities. Wildfire staff continue to monitor the fire environment and have already begun planning and preparations for the 2021 wildfire season.   Quote “This year’s wildfire season came with a number of unique challenges. Staff worked very hard to prepare for what I’m almost certain was our first fire season in the middle of a global pandemic. Luckily, our wet summer kept the number of fires low, allowing our crews to focus on early detection and response. Thank you to everyone who helped to keep our territory safe this year.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources    Quick facts   NWT wildfires 2020 2019 10-yr. average (2010-2020) Total number of fires 70 149 209 Total area burned (ha) 21,139 111,098 653,000   Wildfires are a natural part of Northwest Territories ecosystems. Without fire, our forests would not be able to fully regenerate and fuel would build up on the landscape, making future fires more severe and harder to control. The decision to fight a wildfire or to leave it to burn out naturally may depend on the location of the fire, availability of resources, fire behaviour and the potential to affect values at risk, The GNWT actioned 58 per cent of all wildfires in 2020, compared to 29 per cent normally actioned.  More than 129 individuals were trained as firefighters across all five regions in 2020 (41 as extra fire fighters).  Almost all firefighting services were provided by northern businesses (22 fire crews were provided by 10 Indigenous companies and seven long-term aviation contracts were held by four northern companies).

The first shipments of the season departed Hay River on July 10, 2020 and the last delivery took place on September 19, 2020. A total of 27.9 million litres of fuel and 2,720 tons of cargo were successfully delivered to the following locations:  Aklavik Norman Wells Łutsel K'e  Tulita K’asho Got’ine  Inuvik Tuktoyaktuk Ulukhaktok Sachs Harbour Paulatuk   MTS overcame the challenges to navigation posed by record high water levels on Great Slave Lake and the Mackenzie River, and the imposition of strict mitigation measures for COVID-19. A total of 171 people were employed during the peak of the 2020 sailing season, including 9 graduates of the Marine Training Centre in Hay River.  These employment and training opportunities positively impact families and communities and support the long-term sustainability of the marine industry in the north.   This sailing season also included the arrival of four new double-hulled barges, which have already entered service.   Quote “Four years after the launch of Marine Transportation Services, we continue to improve our capacity to operate a reliable and professional marine shipping service. Our highways are on water and are at the mercy of Mother Nature every day. Regardless of the challenges posed by our Arctic environment, we are committed to providing the best service possible to all our customers. Thank you to the dedicated crews who worked tirelessly to complete these essential cargo deliveries.” - Diane Archie, Minister of Infrastructure   Quick facts MTS provides essential marine transportation services, seasonally dispatching from the Port of Hay River to government, business, industry, and residents on Great Slave Lake, along the Mackenzie River corridor, and in the Western Arctic.  Barge deliveries are traditionally less costly than moving cargo by air, making it more economically feasible for many communities.

17,2020-09-30,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/orange-shirt-day-and-residential-school-legacy,Government Website,Orange Shirt Day and the Residential School legacy,"Premier Caroline Cochrane issued the following statement on Orange Shirt Day and the legacy of the Residential School system: Phyllis Jack Webstat was six years old when she went to residential school in Mission, B.C. She lived with her grandmother who didn’t have very much money. Her grandmother spent what little she had to buy Phyllis a new outfit for school, one she got to pick out on her own.  She picked out an Orange shirt with string laces in the front. It made her excited to be going to school. When she arrived on her first day, they took her clothes and she never got to wear that orange shirt again. The colour orange reminds Phyllis of how her feelings didn’t matter, how no cared about her and her worth.  In the Northwest Territories, most of us know someone who attended a residential school, and we have all felt the impact of the legacy it left, and will for generations to come.  Orange Shirt Day is about respecting the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry Calls to Justice, to make right the decades of colonial oppression against Indigenous people across Canada because of the residential school system.  It’s not only about that: this day is about standing with survivors, and committing ourselves to meaningful reconciliation. It’s our duty to ensure we support healing, respect the rights of Indigenous people, and work towards a future where Indigenous languages and cultures are able to thrive.  The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to working with and respecting the rights of Indigenous governments, and ensuring we remain partners as we move forward with reconciliation. As part of our mandate, we will work with Indigenous governments to create and implement an action plan to implement the principles set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and work to settle all outstanding land claims in the NWT.  The future health and prosperity of the Northwest Territories depends our ability to do this work to advance reconciliation, recognize and affirm Aboriginal and treaty rights, support program and service delivery by Indigenous governments, and set the stage for further economic development in the NWT. On behalf of Cabinet, I encourage everyone to wear Orange today and stand with the right side of history as we work to right the wrongs of the past and blaze a new path forward. "

The extension of the Public Health Emergency is necessary in order to respond decisively to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.    Reminders to NWT residents:  The GNWT is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT remains restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. It is an offense to travel within the NWT without an exemption under the Public Health Orders. Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions – no matter how long your trip out of the territory is. Self-isolation is the frontline of our COVID-19 defence. If you’re required to self-isolate, do your part and stick to the self-isolation plan. By keeping physical distance of two metres, keeping our circles and gatherings small, washing our hands, keeping our coughs and sneezes to ourselves, and wearing non-medical masks when it’s difficult to keep physical distance will help keep everyone safer by preventing cases from becoming outbreaks.   Recent COVID-19 NWT Updates:  Rapid testing expansion has resulted in considerable improvement in testing return times. Work is continuing on increasing capacity further over the coming weeks.  Equipment required for a full-scale-up of wastewater surveillance for roughly half the NWT’s population is expected to arrive in the coming week-and-a-half. Installation and ramp-up will begin shortly after.    Strong and Stable Together: As the COVID-19 has accelerated across Canada, some provinces are talking about locking down again. The NWT is in a position where we are looking at how to move forward faster with careful considerations of risk because of strong, early response.  Wherever there are challenging outbreaks and community spread, business and society are both challenged. By staying strong on a gradual, deliberate path forward together, the territory can build the stability we need to accelerate our economic and social recovery.

By keeping physical distance of two metres, keeping our circles and gatherings small, washing our hands, keeping our coughs and sneezes to ourselves, and wearing non-medical masks when it’s difficult to keep physical distance will help keep everyone safer by preventing cases from becoming outbreaks.   Recent COVID-19 NWT Updates:  Rapid testing expansion has resulted in considerable improvement in testing return times. Work is continuing on increasing capacity further over the coming weeks.  Equipment required for a full-scale-up of wastewater surveillance for roughly half the NWT’s population is expected to arrive in the coming week-and-a-half. Installation and ramp-up will begin shortly after.    Strong and Stable Together: As the COVID-19 has accelerated across Canada, some provinces are talking about locking down again. The NWT is in a position where we are looking at how to move forward faster with careful considerations of risk because of strong, early response.  Wherever there are challenging outbreaks and community spread, business and society are both challenged. By staying strong on a gradual, deliberate path forward together, the territory can build the stability we need to accelerate our economic and social recovery.

While a sales tax is one common way that governments raise revenues to fund the delivery of important programs and services, the GNWT believes that the introduction of a sales tax at this time would lead to an increase in the cost of living to NWT residents that would likely offset potential revenue increases and run counter to our efforts to grow the economy,  “Members of the Legislative Assembly had asked me to consider ways in which the GNWT may generate own-source revenues.  A variety of options including taxation were discussed during recent public dialogue on the upcoming GNWT budget. While the idea of a sales tax was not deemed to be worth pursuing at this time, the GNWT will continue to examine its revenue and spending options to ensure that we are achieving value for money while continuing to deliver important programs and services to all residents of the Northwest Territories.”"

Mr. Turner cared deeply about Canadians, spending decades as a Cabinet Minister under Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Trudeau with a focus on protecting the most vulnerable of our society. As Justice Minister to Trudeau, he improved rights for the LGBTQ+ community as part of Trudeau’s goal of taking the state out of the bedrooms of the nation. He made provisions in the justice system for legal abortions to take place in hospitals. He lead the efforts to ensure the rights of French Canadians were enshrined in the Officials Languages Act of 1969. In February 1970, he established the Law Reform Commission of Canada, to look at ways to improve the justice system to ensure a more fair and equitable process for all Canadians. He was instrumental in being the first Justice Minister to provide funding for legal aid in Canada, something that was near and dear to his heart. He strongly believed everyone had the right to a fair trial, regardless of his or her socio-economic status.  While his time as Prime Minister was short-lived Mr. Turner’s impact on Canadians cannot be overstated. He has impacted the lives of some of the most vulnerable and marginalized, and paved the way for many who came after him."

These programs reflect the importance of increasing food security through locally-harvested food and are a direct response to the challenges our communities are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Country foods are of critical cultural and social importance to NWT residents, and are an important part of overall wellbeing. Harvesting food from the land can help offset the high cost of living by decreasing reliance on store-bought foods, which have significant cost implications for residents, particularly in remote communities. The programs announced today will also help facilitate the exchange of land-based knowledge and provide training for the next generation of hunters and trappers. Three new programs will offer a total of $330,000 in funding to support harvesters and the traditional economy in 2020-2021. These include: funding to assist families in need to go out on the land a regional harvesting, training and mentorship funding program a pilot program for trapper mentorship These new funding programs will begin accepting applications mid-October. Details and application deadlines will be announced in the coming weeks. In addition, under the Genuine Mackenzie Valley Fur Program, the GNWT has enhanced current grubstake payments this year for eligible trappers in light of COVID-19. A second category of eligibility has been created to make additional funding available to more trappers this year. Grubstake payments are intended to help offset some of the annual start-up costs of trapping and encourage participation in the fur industry.  Changes to the Trapper’s Grubstake Program are effective September 15, 2020 and payments will be made directly to trapper’s accounts.    Quote “In the Northwest Territories, life is tied to the land. Supporting land-based skills and knowledge in our communities is an important part of a prosperous, diverse and sustainable traditional economy, and helps ensure access to safe and quality country foods. It is my hope that this funding will help offset some of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our communities this year, while helping to build resiliency and self-reliance into the future. I look forward to seeing what kinds of opportunities are created through these programs.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources    Quick facts The Department of Environment and Natural Resources administers several funding and support programs to encourage sustainable livelihoods and support the NWT’s traditional economy. This includes six established programs under the Genuine Mackenzie Valley Fur (GMVF) Program to support trappers and harvesters. The GMVF Program is designed to protect NWT trappers and harvesters from market downturns and unexpected events such as the current pandemic. For example, the GNWT provides advances on high quality fur so trappers do not have to wait until auction to receive full payment for their furs. The GNWT provides additional support to harvesters through the Community Harvesters Assistance Program (CHAP). Local Wildlife Committees and Renewable Resource Councils are provided with annual funding to help offset the cost of harvesting activities in their community. The three new programs available this fall will provide additional funding this year for families and new trappers, and provide opportunities for harvesting mentorship, support land-based training needs, and promote harvesting that brings foods into communities. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (ENR) hosts annual regional workshops for trappers to provide information on humane trapping, effective pelt handling, the Fur Harvesters Auction, and species-specific information.

40,2020-09-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/enhancing-safety-nwt-rapid-testing-expansion,Government Website,Enhancing Safety in the NWT - Rapid Testing Expansion,"To enhance the Northwest Territories’ ability to detect and react to COVID-19, the Government of the Northwest Territories has expanded the number of in-territory rapid tests used for COVID-19, and procured additional equipment to expand this capacity further in the coming weeks.  Starting immediately the NWT now can process up to 240 COVID-19 tests per week in-territory. Before this milestone, rapid testing was limited to select, high-priority cases. Careful analysis of current territorial testing supplies has determined this level of testing is sustainable in the NWT. These tests will be processed using the BioFire test platform.  An immediate benefit is that patients can expect to receive their COVID-19 results sooner.   Additional swabs beyond the NWT’s capacity of 240 tests per week will continue to be sent to Alberta for analysis. Should this expanded local testing capacity be exceeded, high priority cases, such as individuals presenting at local healthcare centres with more severe symptoms, will be prioritized for local testing.  Four additional rapid testing units are expected to arrive for installation by the end of this week. Validation will begin immediately and human resource needs are currently being addressed.  It is expected that in the coming weeks, the territory should be able to move comfortably to 500 rapid, in-territory tests per week with further expansions on-the-way as human resource and supply capacity allows.   By increasing our capacity and timeliness of testing, not only will we provide better service to residents, but we will also be better positioned to consider the expansion of testing criteria and potential changes to public health guidance.     The GeneXpert testing platform in Yellowknife and Inuvik will continue to be used for high-priority cases and will complement this expanded capacity.  Expanding rapid in-territory testing is one part of an ongoing expansion of epidemiological surveillance to prepare the NWT for an additional surge in infections of COVID-19.  Expanded local diagnostic testing complements the wastewater testing program announced last week.    Quotes “This is a good first step as we work towards getting the turnaround times we need to rapidly identify and respond to COVID-19 cases in our territory. We will continue our work to expand in-territory testing and put ourselves in a position to deliver on every COVID-19 test within our boundaries.” -Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services   “Staff across the NTHSSA has worked hard to ensure COVID-19 testing is easily accessible and results are received as quickly as possible, building in-territory testing capacity is another success in our fight against COVID-19. Residents also have an important role to play, stay safe, keep your distance, wash your hands, wear your masks, and get tested if you have symptoms to keep us all protected.” -Sue Cullen, Chief Executive Officer, NWT Health and Social Services Authority   Quick facts The average number of tests collected weekly across the NWT since the beginning of August is 175. The maximum number of tests collected in the NWT in one week during the pandemic is  478. The health system expects demand for testing will increase in the coming weeks with return to school and the approach of cold and flu season.   Related links Northwest Territories Epidemiology Dashboard Getting Tested for COVID-19   Media contacts  Mike Westwick  Manager, Communications (COVID-19 Response) Health and Social Services  Mike_Westwick@gov.nt.ca    David Maguire Communications Manager Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority David_Maguire@gov.nt.ca "

42,2020-09-15,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/public-health-emergency-extended,Government Website,Public Health Emergency Extended,"Minister of Health and Social Services, Julie Green has extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the advice of Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) Dr. Kami Kandola. The latest extension continues through September 29, 2020.  With record levels of COVID-19 transmission being reported in neighbouring jurisdictions, the risk to the Northwest Territories is increased. The extension of the Public Health Emergency is necessary in order to respond decisively to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Reminders to NWT residents:  The GNWT is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT remains restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. It is an offense to travel within the NWT without an exemption under the Public Health Orders. Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions – no matter how long your trip out of the territory is. Self-isolation is the frontline of our COVID-19 defence. If you’re required to self-isolate, do your part and stick to the self-isolation plan. By keeping physical distance of two metres, keeping our circles and gatherings small, washing our hands, keeping our coughs and sneezes to ourselves, and wearing non-medical masks when it’s difficult to keep physical distance will help keep everyone safer by preventing cases from becoming outbreaks.   Recent COVID-19 NWT Updates:  The territory continues to increase epidemiological surveillance capacity to prepare for the continuing pandemic.  The wastewater surveillance program announced last week is one of the most ambitious in the country – covering roughly half of the territory’s population and 100% of isolation centres. This can provide an early indication of whether COVID-19 is present in the territory, and allow for targeted advice and action.  The wastewater surveillance program will complement an aggressive testing program. Solutions are being finalized for increasing rapid testing capacity in the territory so patients can get results quickly.    All NWT residents, workers and visitors have a responsibility and role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and we must take the necessary steps to protect each other. If that responsibility holds, the Northwest Territories is in a good position to manage this pandemic.

44,2020-09-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/water-quality-results-released-hay-and-slave-rivers,Government Website,Water quality results released for the Hay and Slave Rivers,"Results of water quality monitoring conducted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in July indicate this year’s prolonged high water levels have resulted in more suspended sediment than usual in the Hay and Slave Rivers. As a result of the increased sediment, many metals associated with silt and clay particles were also found at higher than usual concentrations in both rivers for July. In the Slave River, some concentrations of dissolved metals were also elevated, but most were within the range of what has been measured historically in the rivers. It is normal to see increased metal concentrations due to high water, as particles along the river bed and shores are carried downstream. Under these conditions, nutrients such as phosphorus also accumulate in the suspended sediment. These spikes are observed every spring with snowmelt, and have been amplified this year due to long-lasting high water levels across most of the Mackenzie River Basin, including the Athabasca, Peace, Hay and Liard Rivers. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) monitored water quality in the Slave River during the spring breakup and in both the Hay and Slave Rivers through the summer, with some delays beginning summer sampling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Water quality results for samples collected in August from the Great Slave Lake plume as well as additional samples collected from the Hay and Slave Rivers for the analysis of hydrocarbons and pesticides will be released on the Environment and Natural Resources website as they are available.   Quote “All summer we’ve been seeing extreme high water levels, not just in the Northwest Territories but throughout much of the Mackenzie Basin in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. For example, water levels on the Athabasca River this year are among the highest ever recorded. High water levels have affected water quality. The water quality data being shared by upstream jurisdictions as part of our transboundary agreements can help us get a better understanding of what is happening in our lakes and rivers.”  - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources    Quick facts The GNWT monitors water quality within the NWT, including at transboundary sites on the Slave, Hay, Liard and Peel rivers. Long-term monitoring provides a record of changes over time, and will help detect differences and trends in water quality. Water quality is also measured upstream in Alberta and British Columbia by the provincial and federal governments (Environment and Climate Change Canada). While some water quality monitoring was temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, most has now resumed. An agreement was recently reached with Environment and Climate Change Canada for the GNWT to collect water samples on behalf of ECCC at four important transboundary sites near the Alberta-NWT border (Peace River at Peace Point, Slave River at Fitzgerald, Slave River above the Mouth and Hay River near the Alberta-NWT border). Samples were collected in August and are currently being analyzed. The toxicity of a metal depends on the form in which it occurs. When a metal is attached to sediment in the water, it is less likely to be absorbed by aquatic organisms. Dissolved metals are more likely to affect aquatic organisms. High turbidity in water can interfere with the disinfection process for drinking water. The Department of Health and Social Services issues boil water advisories when there is a risk that microbiological contamination may be present in the water supply. When out on the land, no matter how pristine the water, the water should always be boiled at a rolling boil for at least one complete minute to remove harmful microbes.

47,2020-09-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/wastewater-sampling-form-covid-19-early-warning-system-northwest-territories,Government Website,Wastewater Sampling to Form COVID-19 “Early-Warning” System for Northwest Territories,"YELLOWKNIFE (September 10, 2020) – Regular surveillance to identify the presence or absence of COVID-19 will soon be possible because of a wastewater testing program initiated by the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT).  This program will collect regular samples of wastewater (sewage) from Hay River, Yellowknife, Fort Smith, Inuvik, and Fort Simpson, which will be tested for COVID-19.   It is expected these samples will cover approximately half of the territory’s population. They will also cover 100% of all the isolation centres in Hay River, Fort Smith, Inuvik, and Yellowknife.  This form of surveillance has been found to uncover trends of COVID-19 in the community 4-10 days earlier than clinical data would by detecting the presence of the virus in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic populations.  The presence of COVID-19 in wastewater samples does not necessarily indicate there is active COVID-19 transmission in the community.  However, collecting this information can serve as an early warning system for the territory and help the health and social services system target advice to communities as the pandemic continues.  Initial samples have been collected in Yellowknife and Hay River with implementation in the other three communities beginning in the coming weeks.  The effort will be led by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer in partnership with Municipal and Community Affairs, and Environment and Natural Resources. As a key partner, the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory is providing in-kind testing.  An investment of $100,000 from Indigenous Services Canada allowed the territory to purchase the necessary testing equipment and to coordinate the delivery of this program.  The necessary equipment to begin automatic sampling at regular time intervals is expected to arrive in two-to-three weeks. Initial grab samples are being collected at Yellowknife and Hay River to define processes in the meantime.     Quotes: “Our territory is using every tool at our disposal to prepare for another surge in infections across Canada. Establishing an early-warning system using wastewater samples will allow us to have a much better idea of whether COVID-19 is present in our territory, give communities advice, and get people tested if they need it.”  -Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories   “This innovative early detection initiative will allow the Northwest Territories to learn how wastewater surveillance can play an important role in identifying and preventing further spread of COVID-19 by collaborating with scientists from the Public Health Agency of Canada and assisting their researchers in engaging First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. We must continue to support these initiatives that are essential to prevent, prepare and respond to stop the spread of any potential COVID-19 outbreak.” -The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Indigenous Services   Quick facts:  The Chief Public Health Officer would alert the public regarding positive wastewater results and provide applicable guidance at that time. Upon a positive result, guidance and outreach will be targeted at those in the community who have:  							Arrived in the NWT after travel from outside the territory since the last negative wastewater result; and  Developed symptoms of COVID-19.  The recommendation to get tested for COVID-19 and any other necessary advice will be provided.  This strategy would evolve if community transmission develops.  The presence of COVID-19 in wastewater samples alone will not result in aggressive containment measures as it could be connected to imported travel cases being appropriately isolated.  Public health measures like limits on large-scale gatherings or mandatory masking in indoor public spaces will be considered depending on the strength of the signal.    Related Links:  Canadian Water Network Indigenous Services Canada  GNWT COVID-19 Website    Media contact:  Mike Westwick  Manager, Communications and Public Affairs COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat Mike_Weswick@gov.nt.ca  "

This collaboration reflects the ongoing commitment by both governments to conduct important water quality monitoring at long-term monitoring stations. The quality of water is important for NWT residents and for the sustainability of the Mackenzie River Basin. Long-term monitoring provides a record of changes over time, and will help detect differences and trends in water quality flowing from Alberta into the NWT. The collaboration between governments will allow for monitoring to resume in Alberta on the Peace River at Peace Point and the Slave River at Fitzgerald. Within the NWT, monitoring will resume at ECCC’s long-term water quality monitoring sites on the Hay River near the Alberta-NWT border and on the Slave River Above the Mouth. Provincial monitoring in Alberta has already resumed, as has long-term federal monitoring at important sites on the Athabasca River. Water quality monitoring in the NWT has continued throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with only slight delay.   Water samples collected will be analyzed at Taiga Environmental Laboratories in Yellowknife and will also be distributed to Government of Canada-designated laboratories for further analysis.   Quotes “As the ultimate downstream jurisdiction in the Mackenzie River Basin, the Northwest Territories relies on a network of long-term monitoring sites to detect changes in the water and potential impacts from activities upstream. Working with Environment and Climate  Change Canada to resume monitoring at these four important sites will help us answer residents’ questions about the health of the water flowing across our border, and help ensure the waters of the Northwest Territories remain clean, abundant and productive for all time.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources    “Canada’s freshwater is one of our most precious natural resources and it deserves protection for present and future generations. Our Government is committed to working with other orders of government to achieve that goal.” - Michael V. McLeod, Member of Parliament for Northwest Territories   Quick facts In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ECCC enacted its Business Continuity Plan in an effort to prioritize the health and safety of the Department’s workforce. Water quality monitoring officers continue to monitor the situation in collaboration with Northwest Territories water quality experts. Resumption of field activities in the region by ECCC is scheduled in September. In the meantime, collaboration with the Northwest Territories has allowed for enhanced water monitoring on important transboundary rivers. Water levels across the Mackenzie River Basin have been among the highest on record in 2020. This is primarily due to high precipitation throughout the basin (both rain and snow melt). Rising and sustained high water levels are expected to have a temporary impact on water quality, as particles along the riverbeds and banks as well as in flooded areas are carried downstream.

As highlighted in the Government Response to the Findings and Recommendations of the Aurora College Foundational Review, the transformation of Aurora College into a polytechnic university represents a significant organizational change that will create a new range of opportunities for prospective students and the territory as a whole. Every post-secondary institution is unique. Areas of specialization help distinguish institutions, their contributions to knowledge, and their scope of learning opportunities. Specializations at any post-secondary education institution evolve over time and what is proposed in this discussion paper is a starting point for ongoing engagements with partners and key stakeholders around the future polytechnic university. Over time, it is anticipated that the polytechnic university will refine and expand these areas of specialization as the needs of Northerners and the NWT evolve. While areas of specialization are a basis for planning for the new polytechnic university, they will increasingly inform many of the improvements to Aurora College made through the transformation process. It is important to note that, while areas of specialization will guide programming decisions and shape their design and delivery, they do not explicitly dictate what programs will be offered. Programming decisions require further engagement and analysis. As part of its ongoing engagement with partners and stakeholders, the GNWT is sharing the Polytechnic University Areas of Teaching and Research Specialization discussion paper with Indigenous Governments, campus communities, industry and other key stakeholders for their input. Those interested in providing input are asked to do so by end of day on September 28, 2020.    Quote “As part of the transformation of Aurora College into a polytechnic university, we are once again taking an active approach to engaging with partners and stakeholders in the early stages of decision-making. Getting the areas of specialization right is important as they will focus the organizational change that will create a new range of opportunities for prospective students and the territory as a whole. ” 						- R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   Quick facts Feedback on this discussion paper will be accepted until September 28, 2020 Interested public can provide input at the links below    GNWT recently released the Aurora College and Polytechnic University Governance discussion paper that is open for feedback until September 14, 2020.   Related links www.ece.gov.nt.ca/en/have-your-say www.ece.gov.nt.ca   For Media inquiries, please contact:  Cabinet Communications 						Government of the Northwest Territories presssecretary@gov.nt.ca  "

As Western Canada’s rate of infection reaches levels not seen since the beginning of the pandemic, our territory must remain vigilant to protect our communities, and our health system.  The territory is working hard through every avenue to address the challenge of rapid testing supplies.  Solving this problem will provide new options to identify and respond quickly to cases of COVID-19 when they occur in the Northwest Territories. Everyone entering the NWT and those returning, regardless of how long they have been away, is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions. Self-isolation is the frontline of our COVID-19 defence. If you’re required to self-isolate, it is very important to follow your self-isolation plan. By keeping physical distance of two metres, keeping our circles and gatherings small, washing our hands, protecting ourselves and others from coughs and colds, and wearing non-medical masks when it’s difficult to maintain, physical distance will help keep everyone safer by preventing cases from becoming outbreaks. Continued vigilance and responsibility by all is key to responding to COVID-19 risk.  Together, the Northwest Territories can continue to manage this pandemic.

Built at a shipyard in Nanjing, China, the new barges were transported across the Pacific Ocean on the heavy lift ship Hua Yang Long before being delivered to Tuktoyaktuk on August 31, 2020. The barges will improve operational efficiency, reduce logistical challenges, and reduce operating costs to the benefit of NWT communities that are reliant on seasonal marine resupply programs. The double-walled barges will also offer protection for Northwest Territories (NWT) waterways and our oceans. The barges were delivered 381 kilometres outside of Tuktoyaktuk, in a location known as Wise Bay, with no physical interactions or contact with NWT residents as per OCPHO requirements for the NWT. Coordination of their offloading was completed via radio communications only. An open and competitive process was used for the procurement of the barges, with the solicitation period running from December 19, 2018 to February 11, 2019. Nanjing Jinling Shipyard Co. Ltd. (now called China Merchants Jinling Shipyard (Nanjing) Co., Ltd.) was identified as the highest ranked proponent and ultimately awarded the contract. Quote “Currently, fuel is carried to some Northern communities, particularly those along the Mackenzie River watershed, in single-hulled barges. These new double-hulled barges will minimize the risk of a fuel spill and improve the safety of community resupply operations while helping to stabilize the cost of living for our residents.” - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Infrastructure    Quick facts ·       MTS previously had only two double-hulled barges that met regulatory requirements for the transportation of petroleum products on Canadian waterways and oceans. ·       The new barges have the capacity to carry multiple types of petroleum products and deck cargo.  ·      No Northwest Territories businesses participated in the competitive process, nor did any businesses propose that the barges be built in North America.  ·      The $26 million budget for the new barges has been cost-shared between the Government of Canada (75 per cent, or $19.5 million) and the GNWT (25 per cent, or $6.5 million).   Related links ·       Marine Transportation Services ·       Marine Traffic tracker   For media requests, contact:  Public Affairs and Communications Department of Infrastructure Government of the Northwest Territories INF_Communications@gov.nt.ca "

This also ensures that the CSFTNO incurs no prejudice pending the Court of Appeal’s decision.   Quote: “Further review of the recent decision identified several legal issues that warranted the attention of the Court of Appeal. While we are appealing this decision, we are also working together with education bodies to ensure that student’s needs are met. We will achieve this through policy and practice, by establishing clear guidelines for future program requirements”. 						- R.J.

80,2020-08-18,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/public-health-emergency-extended-through-september-1,Government Website,Public Health Emergency Extended Through September 1,"Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom has extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the advice of Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) Dr. Kami Kandola. The latest extension runs through September 1, 2020.  The Public Health Emergency remains necessary in order to respond decisively to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. .  Reintroduction is most likely to occur as a result of travel from locales with community transmission.  The risk to the NWT remains significant as increases in cases in southern Canada continue to grow – particularly within our territory’s closest provincial neighbours.  With self-isolation plans filed reaching more than 900 last week, travel to the territory by returning residents, and others coming to live, work, or study continue to grow.  Additional entries to our territory include those exercising traditional harvesting rights and those servicing supply-chains – though with significant additional precautions when they are here. We remain intimately connected to the rest of Canada, which means public health officials must consider these risks when planning and executing the territory’s response.  The GNWT is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT is restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. It is an offense to travel within the NWT without an exemption under the Public Health Orders. Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions – no matter how long your trip out of the territory is. Self-isolation is the frontline of our COVID-19 defence. If you’re required to self-isolate, do your part and stick to the self-isolation plan.  Taking responsibility for ourselves is crucial. By keeping physical distance of two metres, keeping our circles and gatherings small, washing our hands, keeping our coughs and sneezes to ourselves, and wearing non-medical masks when it’s difficult to keep physical distance will help keep everyone safer by preventing cases from becoming outbreaks.    For more information, visit our website: www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19. www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19/en/services/public-health-orders/emerging-wisely   Media contact: Mike Westwick Manager, Communications (COVID-19 Response) Health and Social Services Mike_Westwick@gov.nt.ca"

Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment released the following statement today regarding the reopening of schools for the 2020-2021 school year:  “Over the past number of months, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment and education bodies have worked hard to create school re-opening plans that will ensure all students in the Northwest Territories (NWT) can continue their education during the upcoming school year. While consideration has been given to the unique circumstance of each community and school, every reopening plan has been developed in accordance with guidelines provided by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO). These guidelines, which are based on the most up to date research from across Canada and around the world, place the utmost importance on protecting students, staff, families, and communities. I am pleased to report that re-opening plans for all 49 schools in the NWT have been reviewed and approved by the OCPHO, and that education bodies have started communicating the details of these plans to students, families and communities.” “I understand that parents, students and teachers will have many questions as we get closer to the first day of school. I want to reassure you that we are working diligently with education bodies and the OCPHO to ensure that school re-opening plans provide an effective learning environment for students while prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of all students, staff and communities.” “The majority of students in the NWT will begin full time, in-person classes in the fall. However, some students will participate in blended learning, which is a combination of in-person and at home education. The reality is that some schools simply do not have enough space within their existing facilities or in their communities to accommodate all students full time while complying with physical distancing requirements mandated by the OCPHO. An extraordinary amount of work and creativity has gone into ensuring as many students as possible will be able to return to schools this fall, and I commend all those involved in achieving this monumental task.” “In order to support the students and teachers participating in blended learning, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment and a number of other departments have been working in collaboration with education bodies to standardize online learning platforms and address gaps in access to technology. This work is being informed by the education system’s recent experience with distance learning.” “Great care has been taken to ensure all school re-opening plans comply with the requirements of the OCPHO and prioritize safety, while still providing an enriched learning environment. That said, there is no doubt that schools will look and feel different this year. We will need to be flexible and responsive, as well as patient and understanding, as we all adjust to a new model of learning.”"

The latest extension runs through August 18, 2020.   The Public Health Emergency remains necessary in order to respond decisively to needs for personal protective equipment, isolation space, enforcement, and travel checkpoints which essential to the territory’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The risk to the NWT remains high as there has been a recent increase in cases in southern Canada. With upwards of 700 new self-isolation plans filed a week, we have a significant amount of people joining us to live, work, or study.  Additional entries to our territory include those exercising traditional harvesting rights and those servicing supply-chains – though with significant additional precautions when they are here.  Reintroduction is most likely to occur as a result of travel from locales with community transmission. Self-isolation protocols and monitored travel are our best defence from these cases growing into outbreaks.  Given compliance is never 100 percent, taking precautions like physical distancing and limiting gatherings, and gradually, safely releasing public health restrictions, are prudent measures for preventing outbreaks from getting out-of-control.  The GNWT is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT is restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. It is an offense to travel within the NWT without an exemption under the Public Health Orders. Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions – no matter how long your trip out of the territory is.

In these instances, activities were moved from Phase 3 to Phase 2.  The organizations approved were:    Yellowknife Gymnastics Club – all programming for those 19-and-under. Yellowknife Amateur Speed-Skating Association – all programming for those 19-and-under.  Yellowknife Sporting Club Hockey Skills Camp – all programming for those 19-and-under. Minor hockey associations have also been invited to submit their plans for return-to-play in preparation for the upcoming season.    Each of these approvals were based on prudent planning by the organizations incorporating guidance from national associations, rigorous public health risk assessments by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer, and a healthy back-and-forth with organizations to help get them guidance on resuming as safely as possible.    In this way, the process allows for some flexibility – recognizing the value these kinds of activities bring to our communities – while keeping to an evidence-based approach to keeping residents as safe as possible during the pandemic.    A similar process is available to all businesses and organizations in the Northwest Territories – and many have accessed it to increase capacity safely to bring their operations a bit closer to normal.    Quote(s) “As we continue to rise to the challenge of COVID-19, revitalizing our communities safely and as much as possible will remain top-of-mind. It’s one way we’re assuring mental, social, and cultural well-being is not neglected during our response.

We’ve been pleased to see a lot of creative thinking from organizations to make their environments safer for their clients and staff with smart changes in their standard operations.

The global COVID-19 pandemic is not over. In the case of some jurisdictions in Canada, we have seen concerning surges in cases as re-opening plans continue.  This is a strong reminder that vigilance and public health measures remain necessary to ensure that risk to residents – and particularly remote communities – is well-managed; that our health system retains capacity; and the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is prepared to respond quickly to new cases or outbreaks.  The GNWT is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT is restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. It is an offense to travel within the NWT without an exemption under the Public Health Orders.  Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions – no matter how long your trip out of the territory is.

The Aa1 rating is the second highest rating available from Moody’s, and remains one of the highest among provinces and territories.  The rating demonstrates the confidence Moody’s has in the GNWT’s financial management despite revenue and expenditure shocks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The GNWT expects an operating surplus this fiscal year, even with COVID-19 – making the GNWT one of the few provinces or territories with such a positive expected fiscal result. The GNWT has a good base to build upon. A significant portion of GNWT revenues come from federal transfers, at roughly 80 per cent, with various own-source revenues comprising the remainder. This highlights the need to carefully control expenditure growth, since the capacity to raise meaningful additional revenues is limited. While additional costs have been incurred because of COVID-19, the GNWT is working hard to ensure that finances are sustainable. First steps include moving to four-year business planning as part of the budget development process and hosting a pre-budget dialogue over the summer months to gauge residents’ views on how best to position the GNWT’s budgeting priorities in light of the current reality and the need to ensure future fiscal health and sustainability.   Quote “This credit review is a positive reflection on the GNWT’s ability to responsibly manage its budget and expenditures. While COVID-19 has led to additional costs, the GNWT is working hard to ensure that our finances are sustainable and we are implementing a multi-year plan to improve our financial position. I look forward to engaging with residents over the next few weeks to get their input on how best to position the GNWT’s budgeting priorities in light of the impacts the response to COVID-19 has had on our territory.” -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance   Quick Facts A high credit rating supports current borrowing at a low interest rate and helps to ensure affordable borrowing costs for future strategic investments. The Aa1 rating is the second highest credit rating issued by Moody’s. An Aaa rating is judged to be of high quality and is subject to very low credit risk. The GNWT’s Aa1 rating is one of the highest  among Canadian jurisdictions.   Related Links Budget 2020-21 Moody’s Investor Services Budget Dialogues   For more information, please contact:  Todd Sasaki Senior Communications Officer 						Government of the Northwest Territories todd_sasaki@gov.nt.ca 867 767-9168 ext. 15015"

Simpson, announced the extension of all Income Assistance (IA) COVID-19 relief measures currently in place.  Under Income Security Programs, the IA program at the Department of Education, Culture and Employment provides financial assistance to residents, including seniors and persons with disabilities, aged 19 years or older, to assist with their basic and enhanced needs.   In March 2020, the IA program modified its suite of benefits to assist the Northwest Territories’ most vulnerable families and individuals. As the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continued to monitor actions from jurisdictions across Canada, the decision was made to further support the territory’s most vulnerable residents by exempting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) in the calculation of IA benefits.  All IA COVID-19 relief measures will continue to be in place until the end of September 2020, and will be reviewed again at that time. This includes: Exempted the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB).  “Payrolled” all clients so that they do not have to report each month; ensuring they receive their payments consistently, and avoids in-person reporting.  Directed that all clients will engage in only one Productive Choice: taking care of themselves and their families. They are not required to report on this productive choice. Exempted monetary donations from being counted as income in their IA benefits, as of April 2020. These may be in the form of gifts from friends, family, benevolent organizations or Indigenous governments.  Quote “Over the last several months we have made numerous changes to provide further support to the people of the north during these rapidly changing times. I am pleased to announce that we are not only making sure these changes continue, we are enhancing them to better serve our residents.  The last thing we want to do is add any additional stress as residents they keep their families safe and navigate the challenges of this pandemic.”   - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   Quick facts On March 23, all GNWT buildings were closed, and essential employees continued to work with clients and the public by phone and email.  To date, the Income Assistance Program has:  §  Provided a one-time emergency allowance for IA clients registered in March to help them with a 14-day supply of food and cleaning products as the stores have them available. Individuals received $500 and families received $1,000.  §  Directed that all clients will engage in only one Productive Choice: taking care of themselves and their families. They are not required to report on this productive choice. §  Streamlined administrative processes so Client Services Officers (CSOs) can focus on working with clients. §  Exempted monetary donations from being counted as income in their IA benefits, as of April 2020. These may be in the form of gifts from friends, family, benevolent organizations or Indigenous governments.  §  “Payrolled” all clients so that they do not have to report each month; ensuring they receive their payments consistently, and avoids in-person reporting.  §  Modified the intake approach for new clients. Clients have been working with CSOs over the phone or by appointment as necessary, requiring minimal verification to ensure they are registered as quickly as possible. They have been automatically assessed for both basic needs and enhanced benefits. §  Exempted the one-time Special Goods and Services Tax (GST) credit for low and modest income residents. §  Exempted the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB). Informed IA clients through handouts, radio ads, and in-person meetings that both the CERB and the CESB are taxable benefits.  §  Exempted the one-time Special Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) payments. §  Exempted the one-time Special Payment for certified holders of the Disability Tax Credit.   Related links COVID-19 Income Security Program changes General Information on COVID-19 in the NWT Applying for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit through the Canada Revenue Agency   For Media Requests, please contact:  Melissa Bannister 					Education, Culture and Employment 					Government of the Northwest Territoriesmelissa_bannister@gov.nt.ca  "

Mr. Jones has found insufficient grounds to warrant an inquiry and has concluded that the complaint is vexatious and was not made in good faith, “I absolutely believe that the behaviour of all Ministers and Regular Members of the Legislative Assembly must be above reproach, in keeping with the great responsibility and trust that the people of the Northwest Territories have placed in us, and fully support the legitimate use of established processes and tools for holding us to account,   “While I am pleased that an independent authority has examined all the facts related to Mr. Jacobson’s complaint and made an unbiased determination about the truth of the allegations, it is disappointing that this formal process meant to uphold the dignity and integrity of the Legislative Assembly and its Members was evidently used for reasons unrelated to our role or work as government,  “All Members were elected to serve the people of the Northwest Territories and work hard to address the needs and priorities of residents and communities. These unfounded allegations have been a significant distraction that have taken up valuable time and attention from Ministers, Members and officials that could have been better used advancing work that would benefit the territory,   “The past few months have been difficult ones for my new Cabinet and a new government, as the whole territory has had to deal with an unexpected global pandemic that is affecting the territory at all levels. I am proud of all the Ministers, who have risen to the challenge of COVID-19 and their new roles.  “Now that Mr. Jones has made his report, I look forward to putting this distraction behind us and to all Members of the Legislative Assembly being able to focus full time on working together in a respectful and professional manner to chart a path out of the current pandemic, advance the priorities of the Legislative Assembly and mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories.”   Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom added: “I am relieved to receive the report of the NWT Integrity Commissioner and his decision to dismiss the complaint against the Premier and myself. I take my role as Minister of Health and Social Services seriously and am committed to doing the best job I can to help protect the health of all residents of the NWT.

A balance between the safety and well-being of children and youth and respecting the public health orders put in place by the Chief Public Health Officer needed to be made.  Child and Family Services had to quickly adjust its services by determining and addressing risks to children, youth, families, caregivers, and frontline staff.   To date, 50% of action items in the plan have been completed.  Progress on key actions includes: Received an additional investment of $3.7 million to add 20 new positions to support Child and Family Services, increased funding for training initiatives, and funding to support the implementation of youth in care network(s) for the NWT.  Offered training to a number of foster caregivers and foster care staff from across the NWT on how to support children and youth with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder. Offered training to Child and Family Services staff so they can refer families to Strongest Families Institute. Developed virtual training for new staff that can be used as a refresher for current staff, including Case Aides and Family Preservation Workers. Completed the 2018-2019 NWT System Wide Audits for all Authorities. Regional Reports were distributed in June 2020. Completed updates to the Serious Occurrence standard, tool and form.  The Quality Improvement Plan Progress Tracker reflects the latest updates. Visit: Quality Improvement Plan (Child and Family Services) Quote “We have experienced some delays in implementing some of the action items identified in the Quality Improvement Plan as we had to reallocate our resources to address COVID-19.  We have made progress in other areas, and with an additional $3.7 million into the Child and Family Services System, we will see improved outcomes for children and families.” - Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services   Quick Facts The Quality Improvement Plan acts on issues identified through internal audits, the 2018 Auditor General Report, Standing Committee on Government Operations and feedback from staff, Indigenous Governments, Foster Family Coalition of the NWT, and other stakeholders. The Quality Improvement Plan is a living document. The Department continuously assesses the system’s capacity to produce key deliverables, which allows for the ability to be flexible and to modify timelines.  The Plan identifies four underlying strategic directions to improve the system and address priorities:  							Culture of Quality: Embedding quality practice into our culture Human Resource Planning: Making sure the right people are in the right places Building Staff Capacity: Investing in our staff Engagement: Drawing on the knowledge and experience of others  Since October 2018, the vacancy rate in the Child and Family Services System has decreased from 25% to 6.3%. To date, 35 action items are completed, 28 are on track, 4 are delayed and 3 are on hold.

Overall, 81 percent of NWT business respondents reported a significant decrease in revenues.  Tourism businesses experienced the largest revenue decreases in April and May followed by those working in transportation.  Together, these two industries saw their revenues decline by an average of 71 percent. Thanks to steps taken to keep diamond mines and the public sector active, the NWT economy will not be impacted as significantly as in other Canadian jurisdictions. Our economy is expected to contract by 3.3% in 2020; but that is significantly less than the national average of 8.2% forecast by the Conference Board of Canada.  While not all sectors will rebound at the same rate or to the same degree, over 90 percent of businesses surveyed in April and May said, they felt they could survive the COVID-19 pandemic. The GNWT’s Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment has administered three surveys since March to evaluate the impact that COVID-19 is having on NWT businesses and the economy – and to help identify where support is needed to promote economic recovery.  While preliminary findings are available, a consumer survey conducted in June to measure the demand-side of the economy is still being compiled.   Quote “The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected economies worldwide, including the NWT economy. While we know that the pandemic is not over yet, we are already making plans to safely re-start our economy with the appropriate measures in place to protect public health, in consultation with Members of the Legislative Assembly, business, and Indigenous and community governments. These surveys will help inform our joint planning and our continuing efforts to support and sustain the NWT economy and businesses.  - Hon. Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry Tourism and Investment     Quick facts Government and Mining will continue to support the NWT economy primarily through procurement opportunities.   Consumer spending and small business spending has rebounded since May. 71% of NWT residents say they are likely to travel within the NWT in the next 6 months.

Simpson wrapped up the 2019-2020 school year with a teleconference on July 7, 2020 with Northwest Territories (NWT) Education Leaders and the NWT Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) to reflect on lessons learned from the final months of the 2019-2020 school year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Much more is now known about COVID-19 since the early days of the pandemic in March, when education bodies made the decision to close schools. This increased understanding, coupled with evolving advice from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO), has allowed education bodies to proceed with the development of comprehensive reopening plans for each school, aimed at keeping students in school as much as possible in the 2020-2021 school year. Although education leaders have always understood and supported schools to be hubs for learning and social development and safe spaces for children and youth, the pandemic has reemphasized the vital role schools play in each community. For the benefit of students and their families, ECE and education leaders will be supporting education bodies to keep schools open as much as possible, even if there are new cases of COVID-19 in the territory. As decisions are made related to a potential second wave of COVID-19, these decisions will be made not out of fear, but based on the most up-to-date public health research and recommendations. Central to the need for continuing in-person education wherever possible are the technological challenges of providing full-time distance learning. The pandemic has highlighted gaps in telecommunications infrastructure, capacity and equipment in communities and homes across the NWT, and attempts to lean upon those technologies full-time would be technically, financially, mentally and emotionally unsustainable for a large percentage of NWT students and their families. Education leaders cautioned that the unpredictable circumstances of the pandemic could result in some schools closing temporarily due to COVID-19. In these instances, schools will be prepared to adapt to blended or distance learning for students. An increased understanding of COVID-19 and reflection on lessons learned has helped to place a priority focus on continuing full-time, in-person learning, especially for the youngest students in Junior Kindergarten up to Grade 9, who are at lowest risk of getting or spreading COVID-19. Regardless of grade level, all students will be provided with opportunities for continued learning throughout the 2020-2021 school year. All leaders agreed that the high level of interagency collaboration and communication maintained since March, including daily meetings between ECE and education superintendents, biweekly education leaders’ meetings, and regular communications between ECE and the OCPHO, was critical in allowing the education system to respond effectively and consistently to COVID-19 with a focus on equity across regions. Education leaders’ meetings will begin again in late summer and continue throughout the 2020-2021 school year. Quotes: “The COVID-19 pandemic has been an important learning experience for the education system in adapting to rapidly changing information while working to ensure the health and safety of all. Although we could not have foreseen the pandemic, our coordination with the Chief Public Health Officer and education bodies over the past months has allowed us to put the planning in place for the 2020-2021 school year so we can reopen schools safely for the benefit of our students and communities.” 					-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “The school closures in March 2019 were a wakeup call to us all. Education bodies had to mobilize quickly to deliver the best quality education possible under the circumstances. Although there were many successes, we have learned a great deal about the various challenges in each of our jurisdictions. Our goal is to continue to work closely with the Chief Public Health Officer, ECE and the NWTTA to open schools as much as possible, while ensuring the safety and success of all NWT students. Once our individual school plans are approved by the OCPHO, each education body will be able to share their plans with their stakeholders.” 					-Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   Media Inquires:  Cabinet Communications 					Government of the Northwest Territoriespresssecretary@gov.nt.ca    "

During their regular biweekly teleconference with Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) Minister R.J. Simpson on Tuesday, NWT education leaders expressed a strong sense of responsibility to publicly support the peaceful protests of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement that have been taking place globally following the death of African-American George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis on May 25. Education leaders also took the opportunity Tuesday to emphasize the need to continue fighting for an end to systemic racism targeting Indigenous peoples. Recent examples of this intolerable racism, education leaders said, are the death of 26-year-old Chantel Moore, an Indigenous woman, by police during a wellness check June 4 in New Brunswick, and the violent arrest March 10 of Athabasca Chipewyan Chief Allan Adam in northern Alberta for expired vehicle license plates. Education leaders noted many NWT students have been significantly impacted by recent events and demonstrations related to racism. They encourage students to think deeply about how they can positively effect change in the fight against all forms of racism and intolerance, including ethnic, religious, and sexuality or gender-based discrimination.  Indigenous families across the territory continue to deal with the trauma of generations of residential school abuse and historic injustices, education leaders said. They acknowledged that schools have an important role in educating and empowering students to reject all forms of racism and intolerance.  ECE and education bodies continue to focus on development of new curricula and ways of incorporating current affairs to ensure historical injustices related to racism and colonialism are actively addressed in student and teacher learning.   Quotes “Education plays a critical role in addressing legacies of racism and other forms of discrimination in our society. I stand beside NWT education leaders in supporting Black Lives Matter and other anti-racist movements, and urge our students to collectively confront racism in their classrooms, communities and country.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “’If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.’ NWT leaders and our youth cannot be quietly neutral about horrific historic and modern-day discrimination against Indigenous peoples. We must stand up for change and equality.”   -Darlene Gruben, Chair, Beaufort-Delta Divisional Education Council, quoting South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu    “As education leaders, we have a responsibility to affirm and show solidarity with movements for equality and social justice, internationally, nationally and locally. Systemic racism marginalizes countless groups across our global society and leads to inequities that must be eradicated.” -Tina Drew, Chair of Yellowknife Education District No.1, on behalf of all NWT education leaders   Quick facts ·       BLM is an organized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience to protest police brutality against African-American people. The movement began in 2013 with the use of hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 fatal shooting of African-American youth Trayvon Martin. George Floyd’s 2020 death by police has prompted global protests.    For media inquiries, contact: Cabinet Communications Government of the Northwest Territories presssecretary@gov.nt.ca  "

The global COVID-19 pandemic is not over and new cases continue to be reported in other Canadian jurisdictions. Strong public health measures continue to be necessary to ensure that the risk to NWT residents is managed and the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is prepared to respond quickly to any new cases and take appropriate steps to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our territory.   While public health measures will continue, the GNWT has determined that there is sufficient authority under the Public Health Act to implement them, and will not be extending the State of Emergency under the Emergency Management Act.  The GNWT declared the State of Emergency early in the pandemic to make sure it was ready to take extraordinary steps to support the implementation of public health orders. As the NWT has been successful at managing the risk of COVID-19 using the tools available under the Public Health Act, it has not had to draw on the additional authorities available under the Emergency Management Act.  The GNWT will continue to review its actions and arrangements for responding to the pandemic to ensure they remain effective and are aligned with the current circumstances, including relaxed restrictions as identified in Emerging Wisely. If deemed necessary, such as in the event of evidence of community spread in a second wave, and the need for additional powers, the GNWT is prepared to re-enact a State Of Emergency.  The Government of the Northwest Territories is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT is restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith - with few exceptions.

Two funding initiatives to support licensed child care programs have been extended until September 30, 2020: funding to pay up to 75% of eligible fixed costs for child care operators; and funding supports for enhanced cleaning of child care spaces. The GNWT will also continue to waive certain fees for residents and businesses, including: Deh Cho Bridge tolls (extended to Sept 30, 2020); truck permits (Sept 30, 2020); NWT airport landing fees (Dec 31, 2020); and Leases, licences, and concession fees at all NWT airports (Dec 31, 2020).

Schools have submitted their detailed reopening plans and are working to have them approved by the OCPHO as soon as possible. The specific details of these plans will be made available by schools and education bodies once they are reviewed and approved.   Quotes “The Government of the Northwest Territories is working diligently with all of our education partners to create a supportive and effective learning environment for students in the 2020-2021 school year and beyond. Reopening Schools Safely outlines how we intend to approach continuing education for all NWT students during the 2020-2021 school year while prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of all students, staff and communities.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “I am confident that this plan forms a solid foundation for a safe, gradual return to school for students across our territory. Infection control, staggered classes, and physical distancing measures will help the learning cycle get going again, while protecting from the spread of COVID-19. These measures will only grow in importance as the pandemic continues to unfold across Canada.”  -Dr. Kami Kandola, Chief Public Health Officer of the Northwest Territories   Quick facts ●      Education bodies are required to prepare reopening plans for each school. These plans are based on specific criteria provided by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO), and must be reviewed and approved by the OCPHO before schools can reopen. ·       All NWT schools have plans to reopen for the 2020-2021 school year.

Simpson repealed the 2016 Ministerial Directive on Enrolment of Students in the French First Language Programs today. The Directive will be replaced by new regulations under the NWT Education Act prior to the start of the 2020-2021 school year. The decision to repeal was made after discussions with stakeholders and in response to concerns regarding the administration of the 2016 Directive and the need to provide more clarity around admission requirements. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) will be consulting education bodies on the new regulations this summer. It is proposed that the new regulations will include the same three categories for admission into French First Language schools as the directive. These include reacquisition (those whose ancestors were rights-holders), new immigrant and non-citizen Francophone streams. Consultation will also include the possibility of a fourth stream of admission that would take French-speaking non-rights-holders into consideration. The regulations will not be more restrictive than the 2016 Directive. New regulations will only pertain to applications for the 2020-2021 school year and beyond. Applications that are currently under judicial review continue to be subject to the Directive.    Quote “The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to supporting the protection of the French language through the provision of French First Language education in the NWT. Codifying the Directive in regulations that will be based on lessons learned and consultation with stakeholders will ensure greater clarity around enrolment in French First Language schools.” - RJ Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   Quick facts The 2016 Ministerial Directive on Enrolment in French First Language Programs outlines which non-rights-holders can be admitted to French First Language schools in the NWT. Rights-holders under Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are automatically enrolled. There are three categories of admission under the 2016 Directive: 		Reacquisition: The parent would have been a rights holder but for his or her lack of opportunity to attend a French first language school or his or her parent’s lack of opportunity to attend a French first language school (i.e. the child’s grandparent);  New immigrants: The parent is an immigrant to Canada, whose child upon arrival does not speak English or French and is enrolling in a Canadian school for the first time. Non-citizen Francophones: The parent meets the criteria of section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms except for the fact that he or she is not a Canadian citizen.

The GNWT is responsible for the purchase, transport, and storage of fuel in 16 communities that are not served by the private sector: Colville Lake, Délı̨nę, Fort Good Hope, Gametì, Jean Marie River, Łutselk’e, Nahanni Butte, Paulatuk, Sachs Harbour, Sambaa K'e, Tsiigehtchic, Tulita, Ulukhaktok, Wekweètì, Whatì and Wrigley. Local contractors sell and distribute these petroleum products to residents and businesses in their communities. Prices are being adjusted by the GNWT following the completion of the winter fuel resupply program, which concluded on April 9. These prices are based on the real costs of completing that program, which includes fuel, transportation and taxes. The specific changes vary by commodity and by community. In most cases, non-government customers’ prices for heating fuel, motive diesel and gasoline will decrease. The prices of naphtha and jet fuel will be increasing in all communities except for one.  Current prices and prices as of July 1st are available on our website.   Quote “In recent months fuel prices across Canada have decreased, which is good news for NWT residents.

159,2020-06-30,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/gnwt-adjusts-isolation-centre-payment-policy,Government Website,GNWT adjusts isolation centre payment policy,"The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is requiring certain non-residents to pay isolation centre costs. Since the beginning of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the GNWT has been paying the costs of all stays in the territory’s four isolation centres. The amended policy adjusts that approach for some individuals.  Non-residents who have received an exemption from the travel restrictions where alternative arrangements have not previously been made will now be required to pay for the cost of their stay at an isolation centre. This will come into effect on July 1, 2020. The GNWT will continue to pay the costs of staying in isolation centres for residents of the NWT and those intending to become residents.  Self-isolation requirements for workers, including essential service workers, supply chain workers, and non-resident workers, who are already employed, will need to have their isolation costs arranged and paid for by the employer or as otherwise agreed to between the employer and the employee. This is the same as the existing arrangement. As the GNWT continues to implement the Emerging Wisely plan it is critical that appropriate public health measures continue to be followed to reduce the risk of exposing residents to the virus responsible for COVID-19 and importing the virus from outside the NWT. This shift in approach is both fiscally responsible while also respecting the needs and rights of the residents of the NWT and Canada.   Quote: “Northwest Territories travel restrictions and self-isolation protocols will continue so long as they are needed to keep our people and communities safe. Requiring non-residents to pay isolation centre costs demonstrates our commitment to being fiscally responsible and sufficiently flexible to meet unique and exceptional circumstances.”   - Caroline Cochrane, Premier and Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs   Quick facts ·       The four isolation centres are in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River and Fort Smith. ·       The average cost for one person to stay in an isolation centre for 14-day self-isolation period is approximately $4,100.     Related links ·       NWT travel restrictions ·       Compassionate and Family Reunification Exemptions      For media requests, please contact: Darren Campbell Municipal and Community Affairs Government of the Northwest Territories Darren_P_Campbell@gov.nt.ca"

This amendment will apply to MPR workers when they return from the jobsite to their homes and includes updating the social distancing protocols NWT MPR workers must follow while outside the jobsite. .They will still be required to comply with all other restrictions in-place for returning to and working at site.  The original Order directed at the Mineral and Petroleum Industry was developed while the NWT was in containment. The level of risk of exposure to COVID-19 for MPR workers living in the NWT no longer aligns with the level of social distancing restrictions placed on the workers. This has changed thanks to widespread testing which has indicated no evidence of community spread in the NWT, and good processes that are in-place to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 at jobsites.  All workers employed at NWT oil and gas, mining, and other remote sites that do not live in the territory are still subject to the same restrictions while they are no longer at the jobsite and in their home jurisdictions. This includes limiting social interaction to immediate household members inside and outside the home.   Quote “Our public health orders are designed to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 as people continue to enter our territory from places where the virus is more prevalent. This amendment ensures all residents are able to enjoy the ease in restrictions that our territory is awarded as a result of the immediate actions put in place by the Chief Public Health Officer and NWT residents who played their part early on and made sure those measures were followed. .  - Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services    Quick facts The public health order directed at the Mineral and Petroleum Industry outlines specific social distancing protocols and behaviours which must be followed by all workers before coming to the job site in order to reduce contact with others.  The original Order limited activities to MPR workers such as getting haircuts or eating out. These activities are now allowed under Relaxing Phase Two.  This change only applies to NWT resident MPR workers and is simply meant to clarify that while these workers are at home they can also experience the relaxed measures already being experienced by their fellow community members.  Relaxing Phase Two of Emerging Wisely outlines specific precautions which must be taken by everyone in the Northwest Territories on things like:  		Physical distancing  Household get-togethers  Indoor gatherings – like those in businesses or community facilities  Outdoor gatherings    Related links Public Health Orders Emerging Wisely Relaxing Phase 2   Media contact:  Mike Westwick  Manager, Communications (COVID-19 Response) Health and Social Services  Government of the Northwest Territories  Mike_Westwick@gov.nt.ca"

Both extensions will take effect as of June 24, 2020 and expire on July 08, 2020. Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) Dr. Kami Kandola.  Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. The COVID-19 pandemic continues in Canada and around the world. To protect the health of NWT residents, there will continue to be a need for appropriate public health measures and restrictions, including the continuation of the state of Public Health Emergency and the implementation of public health orders issued and enforced by the CPHO. As a result of these measures, the NWT has been successful in managing the risk of COVID-19 to date and has been able to begin implementing Emerging Wisely, the CPHO’s plan for relaxing public health restrictions.  From the start, the addition of the State Of Emergency to support the Public Health Emergency was a proactive measure to ensure the government’s preparedness to respond to any situation that may arise. Extension of the State of Emergency continues to give the GNWT the option of accessing exceptional powers under the Emergency Management Act to support implementation of the Public Health Emergency and public health orders if needed.  The GNWT will continue to review its actions and arrangements for responding to the pandemic to ensure they remain effective and are aligned with the current circumstances, including relaxed restrictions as identified in Emerging Wisely.   The Government of the Northwest Territories is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT is restricted with limited exceptions. Everyone entering the NWT is still required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith before travelling to their home community – with few exceptions. .

Simpson met with Northwest Territories (NWT) Education Leaders and the NWT Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) via teleconference on June 16, 2020 to discuss details of school reopening plans and how learning will be maintained throughout the 2020-2021 school year. All NWT schools have submitted plans for approval to reopen for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools are striving to provide a safe way for students to receive as much in-person, curriculum-based instructional time in classrooms with teachers as possible, with new health and safety procedures and restrictions in place. When full-time in-person learning is not possible, education will be delivered through a blended learning approach, where students are learning part time in school, as well as part time at home or on the land. Distance learning will also be available for students who cannot attend school due to higher health risks, or in cases where schools must close temporarily due to serious health and safety concerns posed by COVID-19.  The COVID-19 pandemic is a dynamic situation and plans may need to change as new information or public health and workplace safety requirements are identified. Education bodies are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020, which includes measures to ensure schools are able to remain open, to the extent possible, if there are new COVID-19 cases in the NWT and that, regardless of circumstances, students will continue to learn. Schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases, and parents, guardians, students and communities should be prepared for the learning situation to change quickly in response to evolving circumstances.  Education Leaders discussed how to best communicate school reopening plans with the public. Details of reopening plans will vary for each school and grade level, and will be shared with students, staff, parents, guardians and the public once reviewed and approved by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer. A high level public document will also be released that lays out what the public can generally expect to see at schools in the upcoming 2020-2021 school year. ECE and its education partners are working diligently to create a supportive and effective learning environment for students in the 2020-2021 school year and beyond, and are committed to providing regular updates to the public as plans move forward for the upcoming school year. Quotes: “As we work together to develop plans to reopen schools in the fall, we continue to anticipate the ongoing and evolving challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools will be taking a flexible approach that prioritizes in-person learning, while providing alternative options for continued learning to ensure our students continue to receive education while we protect the health and safety of students, staff and communities.” 	-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “Although there are many moving parts to consider, all education bodies are staying the course and are now developing plans for the 2020-2021 school year. Once our school plans are approved by the OCPHO, we will be able to share the details with parents, remembering that changes may still be forthcoming. We are proud of our work and look forward to sharing our plans with our stakeholders soon.” -Erin Currie, Chair of Yellowknife Catholic Schools, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   Media inquiries: Cabinet Communications 	Government of the Northwest Territoriespresssecretary@gov.nt.ca  "

As restrictions are eased by the Chief Public Health Officer, and in keeping with the spirit of flexibility, the SEED program can now be accessed to cover costs to businesses such as: ·       Structural changes required to protect employees (i.e. plexiglas shields); ·       Capital improvements (i.e. drive through windows or outdoor patios for restaurants);  ·       Investments related to shifting operations online; and  ·       The purchase of personal protective equipment for employees.   Businesses that have already made such investments on their own will be permitted to apply for a portion of this investment, retroactive to April 1, 2020.  Applications should clearly demonstrate financial need and the need for the proposed improvements in order to open and function properly.  The remaining elements of the existing SEED policy - including funding maximums - remain in place. Funding proposals will still need to be forward-looking and include a viable business case.   Quote: “We have stated from the outset that our programming will be flexible.

I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to the members who have agreed to be a part of this advisory body. I’d also like to thank Ms. Jenni Bruce from the Northwest Territories Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Paul Gruner, President of Det’on Cho Corporation, for agreeing to serve as the Committee’s co-chairs. “While I was pleased to address Members, my role in future meetings will be to listen. The Council will report independently on its work, priorities, and recommendations, and I look forward to receiving this input.  “With over 300 years of collective business experience in the North, and leadership from within the NWT’s business community itself, the Business Advisory Council is well positioned to be a representative voice for NWT businesses to the Government of the Northwest Territories.  “These are difficult economic times, but together and with the insight from the Business Advisory Council and Members of the Legislative Assembly, I know that we can move forward and emerge wisely from this crisis to revitalize, strengthen, and grow our economy into the future.”"

The system includes passes for residents from the NWT and Alberta representing various situations and activities commonly shared between Fort Smith, Fort Fitzgerald, Smith’s Landing, and other nearby communities.  NWT residents from outside of Fort Smith are also able to access this system – opening up staycation possibilities for NWT residents.  For NWT residents: ·       Standard access pass: allows for day-use travel in-and-out of the NWT as far as Fort Fitzgerald and the Salt River Day Use area, and provides an authorized exemption to the self-isolation protocol requirements.  ·       Limited access pass: allows for overnight travel in Alberta where the final destination is north of Hay Camp on Highway 61, or north of Peace Point on Highways 58 and 60 (includes Pine Lake). ·       Restricted access pass: allows for overnight travel Passes for travel originating in the NWT for travel to and from Alberta where the final destination is farther than Hay Camp on Highway 61, or farther than Peace Point on Highways 58 and 60.

The GNWT continues to work with Transport Canada and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) towards additional funding for the NWT aviation industry beyond June 30, 2020. Quote This funding will help northern aviation companies continue to operate as they deal with the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic. While this is an important step that will help these companies to stay in the air in the short-term, we must continue to work with our federal partners to ensure that longer-term support is available to support the aviation industry. —Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance Quick facts Today’s funding announcement covers the period of April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020.

Amendments have been made to form a two-territory travel bubble with Nunavut.    Other amendments include clarification on requirements for those moving to the NWT and traveling within the NWT for work or school. There is also additional clarity for family reunification as a compassionate exemption.    Notice of Future Amendments    Future amendments will also be made to the travel order to allow exemptions for residents of the NWT who are employed as:    Supply chain workers Flight crews Airline employees These workers regularly leave the territory for employment purposes and return in the course of the same day. They have minimal contact with other communities and therefore the need to self-isolate, so long as the right precautions are taken are not necessary.    These situations to date have been handled on a case-by-case. The future amendments would eliminate the need for this burdensome implementation step, and provide clear precautions for these workers to abide by.   Quote(s): “I am pleased that our territory has reached a point where the Chief Public Health Officer feels it is safe to move into phase two of the Emerging Wisely Plan.  Reaching new phases is an important part in making sure our territory is moving forward and able to focus efforts on recovery. As we continue to meet these milestones, the GNWT will continue to work together and find ways to support NWT residents and ensure the health and safety of our people, territory and economy are at the forefront of our decisions.  - Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories     “The changes residents of the NWT have made to the way they live, work, and play during the COVID-19 pandemic, is what has allowed us to reach this phase two milestone. As we enjoy the loosened restrictions though, we are accepting more risk and more responsibility. Chances are we will get more cases in the future, so playing our part and following the rules and recommendations are more critical than ever to keep the ones we love safe.”  	- Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services   “I’m pleased we’ve reached a point where we can revitalize our communities and un-cancel summer. But remember – COVID-19 is unforgiving, and it can move silently. So be on high-alert – not just for today. Get used to good habits we’ve been practicing as we prepare for a large surge of infections across Canada most experts believe will come this fall. Keep up with the basics: wash your hands, cough and sneeze into a tissue or flexed elbow, stay two metres apart, keep your get-togethers small, wear a non-medical mask when you’re out and unable to keep your distance, and stay home if you’re sick. That’s how we can keep each other safe.”  - Dr. Kami Kandola, NWT Chief Public Health Officer   Quick facts: The two-territory travel bubble will allow NWT residents to visit Nunavut without needing to self-isolate upon return, and vice-versa once Nunavut has completed the requisite changes to their public health orders. As of today, Nunavut residents will be able to visit the NWT without self-isolating.  This will not exempt Nunavummiut who are required to self-isolate when returning from travel outside of their territory.  Residents should note that travel originating anywhere other than the Northwest Territories continues to not be permitted in Nunavut. They will not be able to enter.  Self-isolation is still required to take place in the existing isolation communities – Fort Smith, Hay River, Yellowknife, and Inuvik.  For those coming for professional reasons, the GNWT will not be responsible for costs if an established isolation centre must be used.  Existing processes for essential workers, infrastructure workers, those supporting essential workers (i.e. childcare providers), and remote camp workers remain the same.

Simpson: Planning for the Junior Kindergarten – Grade 12 2020-2021 School Year,"Mr. Speaker, as the end of the 2019-2020 school year approaches, planning for how to safely reopen schools in the fall is well underway. The Department of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) is working diligently with its education partners to create a supportive and effective learning environment for students in the 2020-2021 school year, and beyond. 	  As we emerge wisely into more relaxed public health restrictions, I want to be clear: the upcoming school year will not be a return to normal. I understand that all of us want desperately to get back into our routines and have this crisis end. That cannot happen this fall and the number one priority of my office and the Department of ECE has to remain the health and safety of our students and education staff. Schools will be taking strong action to meet the recommendations of the Chief Public Health Officer while providing Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 education programs and services starting this fall and we continue to need the support of all our residents to make this happen. 	  Mr. Speaker, ECE and education bodies responsible for delivering education are working on a coordinated, system-wide approach for the coming school year that is based on the detailed criteria provided by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer on how to safely reopen schools. This approach is focused on achieving the following priorities: Maintaining the health and safety of students, staff and communities; Starting the school year on time; Maximizing in-person learning, as much as possible; Seeking equity across regions; Maintaining financial supports to schools, and the programs they offer; and, Supporting continuity of learning. While details on specific health and safety measures will vary from school to school, Mr. Speaker, there are some general measures that will be enacted in schools across the NWT to help maintain physical distance. These include: Limits on class sizes; Enhanced cleaning and disinfecting practices; Strict hand-washing routines; Designated entrances and exits; Staggered breaks, drop-offs and dismissals; Use of personal protective equipment by staff and students when physical distance cannot be maintained; Spacing of desks and other furniture; Restricting and managing flow in hallways and common areas, through floor markings and/or physical barriers; Encouraging activities to take place outdoors, when possible; Restrictions on assemblies, choir and music classes, drama, team sports and other gatherings, where physical distancing is not possible; and, Limited access to schools for parents, guardians and visitors. Education will be delivered, based on factors such as school size and layout, grade level, the number of students and staff, access to technology, and the unique needs of each student. Individual schools will be making adjustments to student transportation, food programs and scheduling in order to accommodate public health recommendations. 	  In our smaller schools, it is likely that students will be safely accommodated within the existing space, and will not need to rely as much on distance learning. However, larger schools with more staff and students will have a harder time delivering the full extent of education programming within the school space. In these situations, schools may access space outside of the school, provide a blended learning approach that will prioritize in-person learning, or continue to support at-home distance learning if necessary. 	  Mr. Speaker, this is a dynamic situation and plans for the coming school year may need to change as new information or public health and workplace safety requirements are identified. Education bodies are taking a flexible approach to their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020 to ensure schools are able to open and remain open. The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to providing regular updates to the public as plans move forward for the upcoming school year. 	  Each school will need to have its reopening plan assessed and approved by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer and the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission. All schools are working to have their detailed plans submitted before the end of the current school year, and details of these will be made available to students, parents, guardians and staff once those plans are reviewed and approved. In addition, ECE will be publishing a territorial plan on reopening schools for the 2020-21 school year later this month. 	  Mr. Speaker, the health and safety of residents and communities of the NWT is our primary concern. As we near the end of this school year, ECE remains committed to providing support to education leaders, students, parents, guardians and teachers as we truly work together to meet public health and safety requirements, while supporting the critical learning and well-being of all NWT students.  	  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The difficult times that we are emerging from highlight that safe and secure housing is one of our highest needs.  The delivery of housing services became more challenging given our need to stay healthy in preparation of COVID-19 through physical distancing. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the individuals and organizations involved in ensuring safe housing and affordable shelters are available to our residents.  Many of these people work behind the scenes delivering critical services for housing solutions and emergency repairs.   I am proud and grateful for the work being done by the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation staff and all of our community partners, such as local housing organizations and emergency shelter providers that help us to provide housing and homeless supports.  These important front-line workers support approximately 2,800 units under Northwest Territories Housing Corporation programming and five emergency overnight shelters. Indigenous government partners worked diligently with the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation.  When faced with the uncertainty of how COVID-19 would impact their communities, the Délı̨nę Got’ı̨nę Government and the Łutsël K'é Dene First Nation had no hesitation in offering to take on the administration of some public housing units for the purposes of self-isolation.  While ultimately, these units were not required to address COVID-19, these communities and their leaders demonstrated to their people that they were prepared to do what it takes to keep their residents safe. I want also to thank the private industry for their contributions during this time.  Many landlords faced their own economic pressures. In the community of Hay River, I want to thank the owners of the North Country Inn, which was utilized to support some residents experiencing homelessness.  Large industry also wanted to help out.  In Norman Wells, Imperial Oil Limited offered the use of some of its staff housing should it be required. I want to recognize the work of staff at the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation who successfully continued to deliver essential services such as emergency repair programming, rent support and the Homelessness Assistance Fund.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank our partners in delivering housing in the communities, who are facing their own challenges right now, like reductions in income, a lack of childcare, and dealing with the mental strain caused by the uncertainty around COVID-19. I want to express my gratitude for their commitment to housing our residents and their professionalism during this time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The ultimate goal we are all working towards together should be safe communities where our citizens can thrive. The Minister’s Policing Priorities for 2020-2021 have been under development since April and were already in their final form when the ongoing challenges of systemic racism within law enforcement took center stage around the globe.   As we are all acutely aware, the world has changed drastically over the past few months. While it may initially have been a global pandemic that illustrated the need for out-of-the-box thinking as it pertains to our justice and policing systems, it has been society’s recent awakening to the reality of racial injustice that has driven this home. It has become apparent that innovation and reform are necessary in these systems, and that the status quo is no longer acceptable.       We considered not presenting these priorities today through this statement, but decided we cannot shy away from the painful reality of racism and a potentially difficult conversation about policing.  So I will proceed to present the policing priorities today, and I look forward to engaging in more conversations with the RCMP and with the members.  For 2020-2021, the four themes of policing priorities are: first, promote confidence in policing services; second, adapt to changing enforcement and community policing landscapes; third, continue to improve the RCMP’s response to vulnerable population; and lastly, operational and fiscal innovation. Regarding the first priority, the need to build confidence and trust in those who we have trusted with our safety is foundational. Confidence will come from trust; trust requires a relationship and mutual respect. It is also something that must be constantly and consistently nurtured and protected.  To serve communities effectively, it is critical to acknowledge, reflect and learn from a past that has not always been characterized by mutual respect and use those lessons to improve understanding, empathy and cultural safety in how policing is done today. Some progress in establishing trust has been the creation of the Commanding Officer’s Aboriginal Advisory. In addition, the NWT has an Aboriginal Policing Services unit within G Division, and the division’s commanding officer has directed that all new members to a community must complete a personal biography to be presented to the community.  As well, they are required to attend a cultural orientation specific to the community where they have been placed, that includes meeting with local Indigenous organizations and Elders. Such steps should be recognized, but that does not mean the work is done; and so promoting confidence in policing remains a priority.   Northwest Territories communities have made it very clear how much harm they witness in their communities from alcohol misuse, drug trafficking and bootlegging. Bootlegging and substance abuse have been identified on almost every community’s Community Policing Action Plan. In addition to further cracking down on illegal alcohol and drug trafficking, we’ve also identified the need for more effective enforcement of impaired driving legislation as a means to keep our communities and streets safe.  The RCMP must continue to foster trust within communities to help residents feel more comfortable reporting illegal alcohol and drug trafficking and impaired driving which will allow the RCMP to implement more effective crime prevention and enforcement strategies. Although we know that root causes underlying the misuse of alcohol lie in areas beyond the influence of police, their enforcement efforts are integral to the disruption of the illegal networks taking advantage of people living with addictions and mental illness.  The Department of Justice on the RCMP as a first point of contact for the diversion of suitable matters to local restorative justice options such as the Community Justice Committees. Restorative justice practices and principles have long been linked to more positive outcomes for both offenders and victims. By increasing the use of more restorative practices, the RCMP will play a vital role in identifying matters for youth and adult diversion early in the justice system process.  The second priority, adapting to a changing community landscape, is linked to the third priority, which is: improve the RCMP’s response to vulnerable populations. 	The RCMP play a critical role acting as the first point of contact for many people experiencing family violence by informing victims of their rights and connecting those victims to community supports. Recognizing that family violence rates remain consistently high in the Northwest Territories; it is essential that RCMP members and Victim Service workers continue to collaborate so that victims’ rights are recognized and respected. With that said, we also recognize the challenges victims face in reporting sexual assault. We look to the RCMP to continue working with stakeholders and partners including the Department of Justice to implement solutions that would ensure a thorough investigation of a complaint in each and every case. Implementing trauma-informed investigative tools remains a best practice of our police officers and in turn, is an area of focus we’ve identified for the coming year. This lessens the impact of crime and trauma on victims and their families, while also aiding in healing and recovery. Proper training, and accurate use of investigative tools, go a long way to improving the quality of the response provided to survivors of violence.  Our last remaining priority, with connection to the third, is operational and fiscal innovation. Mr. Speaker, the world is experiencing an unprecedented challenge with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Policing is a critical piece of our emergency planning. The RCMP should continue careful planning to support safe communities, and the safety of their members, throughout this evolving situation. They should continue to participate in emergency planning within their scope at the territorial and federal level and collaborate wherever possible with territorial departments and agencies to help keep Northwest Territories residents safe. As we continue to work through the added challenges we face as a result of this pandemic, as well as addressing racism within law enforcement, it is more incumbent than ever on the Government of the Northwest Territories and the RCMP to work collaboratively to leverage our efforts for the benefit of our communities. While this might require some ingenuity, I am confident that we have appropriate and rigorous checks and balances in place to hold our organizations accountable to operate innovatively within the financial limits of our contract. In closing, I reiterate that annual Ministerial police priorities are part of a much wider conversation that includes acknowledging both a past and present that still needs much healing, about building trust and finding a way forward so that police services are partners in upholding and protecting the safety of all people.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
190,2020-06-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-covid-19-and-nwt-economy,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: COVID-19 and the NWT Economy,"Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted every aspect of life in our territory.   The Government of the Northwest Territories has responded to the pandemic in a variety of ways. In addition to the measures taken to protect the health and safety of our residents and communities, our government has acted to mitigate the economic impacts of this crisis on our economy, and to invest in the economic well-being of Northwest Territories industry and businesses.                                                                Mr. Speaker, we knew that for our economy to recover, we would need our mines and supporting industries to be operating, small businesses to be open, and our people to be working.   That being said, our first priority was to address the health and safety of entrepreneurs, business owners, and their employees.  Following that, we acted to ensure that Northwest Territories communities and residents would continue to receive critical supplies. With so many remote and dispersed communities, we are acutely aware of the importance of the supply chain, perhaps more so than some of our southern counterparts. Since these initial first steps, Mr. Speaker, the Departments of Infrastructure and Industry, Tourism and Investment  have rolled out a sequence of measured and organized steps, in tandem with the federal government, to ensure funding reliefs are available. Some of these reliefs include waiving fees impacting truckers and air carriers to provide nearly $2.5 million dollars in economic relief. We have also continued to advocate regularly to the federal government, on behalf of northern airlines facing unprecedented operating challenges due to the pandemic. Capital loans have also been made available through the Business Development and Investment Corporation to businesses that needed immediate liquidity.  Mr. Speaker, since March 20th, the GNWT has committed over $20 million dollars in off-sets and supports for NWT businesses.   Collectively, our territory, its governments, business chambers, and stakeholder organizations, have been able to deliver the message in Ottawa that we need specific and regionally-appropriate support programs for our businesses.   As a supplement to Canada’s national business relief plans, CanNor’s Northern Business Relief Fund significantly expanded relief options for NWT and Indigenous businesses.  On May 8th, the Minister of Finance announced $8.7 million for NWT airlines; the first of two phases of federal funding to help maintain the critical links that they provide.  On May 12th, with support from the federal government, the GNWT then announced a $6.2 million plan to top up wages for workers making less than $18 per hour.   Through all of this Mr. Speaker, we have also worked with our mines and resource companies to ensure their safe and continued operation. We have taken steps to protect mineral tenure in the NWT by suspending payment and work requirements until the end of June, and will be extending this relief for an additional 90 days.  We will need our resource sector to anchor our recovery.  Mining and exploration are the biggest source of private sector jobs and income for our residents, and as we get back to business, will be a major buyer of products and services from NWT companies.    The Mining Incentive Program has been adapted to support NWT prospectors and company-led mineral exploration projects, and to ensure that their projects this summer will be in line with orders and conditions of the Chief Public Health Officer. Mr. Speaker, much has been said about the need for economic stimulus and recovery but it is only thanks to our investments in relief efforts that we are able now to look forward. As we do, an important component of economic stimulus and recovery will be investment in GNWT infrastructure projects. Not only will these projects inject money into the economy, they will provide business and employment opportunities for our residents.   In 2020/2021 the GNWT is planning to invest over $500 million in infrastructure throughout the NWT.  This will allow us to deliver a total of 152 capital projects in 28 NWT communities, including schools, long-term care and health care facilities, and major transportation projects. Many of these projects are multi-year projects that will begin or continue this year. This investment continues to leverage significant federal infrastructure dollars. Mr. Speaker, the GNWT will continue to advocate and work with the federal government on infrastructure initiatives that lead to jobs, economic growth, and prosperity for both the NWT and Canada. Meanwhile, as NWT businesses begin to resume operations across the North, we have 	re-introduced our Support for Entrepreneurs and Economic Development Policy Program for the 20-2021 fiscal year.  It represents $4 million dollars of potential investment into projects in which community employment is emphasized, and where the bulk of the funding will be spent in our communities. Similarly, we will inject almost $4.4 million into parks infrastructure, tourism product development and community infrastructure projects this summer; supporting local suppliers, contractors, and employees as we improve our tourism product for the future. As we begin to Emerge Wisely from public health measures, Mr. Speaker, economic recovery will begin within our territory, and will depend greatly on what we can do for each other. The importance of the “BuyNorth” or “ShopNWT” message has never been as true as it is today.  Our recovery will also have to be in step with the needs and capacity of our business community.   The new Business Advisory Council will be the voice of NWT business to my office.  It will ensure that the experience, talent, and resources of the NWT’s private sector are considered in our decision making. And, as we look ahead, I believe the collective 	world-wide effort that will be put into economic recovery will bring new opportunities. If we can position ourselves to learn from the wave of innovation that I believe we will see, we can re-imagine our own economy for the future; one that continues to promote our wealth of natural resources, but also encourages a more diversified and resilient economy that builds upon our natural strengths. Thank you Mr. Speaker "

Premier Caroline Cochrane and Dehcho First Nations (DFN) Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian are pleased to announce today that the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is indefinitely extending a subsurface land withdrawal for the Edéhzhíe Protected Area. The extended withdrawal will complement this culturally and ecologically important region’s future designation as a National Wildlife Area.  A multi-stakeholder working group recommended the permanent protection of the ecological and cultural values of Edéhzhíe through National Wildlife Area designation under the Canada Wildlife Act. Completing the designation will honour shared principles and values between DFN and GNWT and support community job creation, climate action, regional decision-making, and implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.   Premier Cochrane and Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian are also announcing their highest level of commitment to complete the Dehcho Land Use Plan as soon as possible. The finalized Plan will provide a shared vision to respect land in the region in a manner that guides conservation and supports the economic, social and cultural well-being of residents in the Dehcho.   Quotes: “Our government has made a commitment to strengthening relationships with Indigenous governments and finding innovative solutions to outstanding challenges. I am very pleased to see the willingness of the Dehcho First Nations to engage with the GNWT and advance our shared priorities, including the protection of Edéhzhíe and the completion of the Dehcho Land Use Plan. By working together, I am confident that the GNWT and the DFN can build strong, trusting and respectful relationships that will resolve many of the complex challenges we have faced for decades.”  Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories  “Edéhzhíe represents a new government to government relationship and hope for the future. Our elders and leaders have always regarded Edéhzhíe as an important landmark. They worked faithfully to achieve permanent protection for many years and today we celebrate this important milestone. It ensures a successful future for Edéhzhíe that will help enable Dene survival and well being into the future. As Dene, we understand the importance of taking care of the land, and our relationship to the land, as being integral to our culture and language. In Dene Zhatié we have a saying, “yundáa gogha” meaning “for the future” and Edéhzhíe brings us renewed hope for future.” Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian, Dehcho First Nations “Edéhzhíe is a significant cultural and ecological area, and the work to advance the Edéhzhíe National Wildlife Area is an important piece of the land management picture for the Dehcho Region. This unique, Indigenous-led protected area is designed to preserve not only the biodiversity of the area, but also the rich cultural traditions of the people who call this land home.  I am very encouraged to see the GNWT and DFN focus on completing a Dehcho Land Use Plan. Having a complete picture for shared land management throughout the Dehcho Region will help communities and residents of the region build a stronger and more diverse regional economy.”  Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources, Minister of Lands  Quick Facts: Completed land use plans that reflect the priorities and values of Indigenous residents and governments, NWT residents and the federal and territorial governments are important tools for guiding shared decision making about the management of land and resources in applicable regions.  The GNWT land withdrawal provides indefinite protection for 14,200 square kilometres of subsurface land to complement the designation of an Edéhzhíe National Wildlife Area.  Designation of Edéhzhíe as a National Wildlife Area would provide new opportunities for Dehcho residents to participate in the conservation economy.  Creation of the National Wildlife Area will provide protection for critical boreal caribou habitat.  It would protect 1.1% of the NWT and contribute 0.14% to Canadian Biodiversity Target 1 (to protect 17% of Canada’s land and inland water).  With the establishment of Edéhzhíe the NWT has more than 17% of its land and freshwater protected.    Links Edéhzhíe (ENR) Department of Lands – Land Use Planning Dehcho First Nations Website Finding Common Ground - a renewed commitment to regional land use planning in the Northwest Territories Dehcho Land Use Planning Committee  Deh Cho First Nations Interim Measures Agreement Media inquiries:Trista Haugland                                                                      	Cabinet Communications                                                        	Government of the NWT                                                         	Tel: 867-767-9140 ext. 11090                                                             	Email: trista_haugland@gov.nt.ca Dahti Tsetso 	Director of Lands & Resources 	Dehcho First Nations 	Tel: 867-447-3526 	Email: Dahti_Tsetso@dehcho.org    "

193,2020-06-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-senior-citizens-month-june,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Senior Citizens Month - June,"Mr. Speaker, the month of June is designated as Senior Citizens Month in the NWT.  It is a time to recognize and show appreciation for the contribution made by seniors and elders to our communities, our families and society in general.  In the Northwest Territories, seniors continue to be the fastest growing demographic in our population.  In fact, it is projected that seniors and elders will comprise approximately 20 per cent of our territory’s population by 2035. This presents opportunities as well as challenges, Mr. Speaker.  We must ensure our seniors have a good quality of life that enables them to thrive and continue to be respected and contributing members of society.   One of the priorities of this 19th Legislative Assembly is to enable seniors to age in place with dignity. We must ensure that seniors have the necessary supports that allow them to live at home for as long as possible.  The GNWT is working across all levels of government and with community partners to ensure a wide range of social programs are available to meet the needs of seniors, including housing, financial and income supports, health care supports and accessible community infrastructure and transportation. Mr. Speaker, one serious challenge that negatively affects many of our seniors’ quality of life is elder abuse. June 15th is designated as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day to bring awareness and encourage dialogue around this important issue.   This is a topic that is uncomfortable to acknowledge or discuss, as elder abuse financial, emotional or physical can happen in a senior’s own home.  We must continue to address this so to ensure vulnerable seniors are protected.  The NWT Seniors’ Society has worked closely with the GNWT and has been instrumental in taking the lead on elder abuse prevention initiatives by way of awareness workshops and by providing a toll-free Seniors Information Line. To complement this support, the NWT Help Line service offers confidential counselling support for residents of all ages in need of support.  Mr. Speaker, one of our first responses to the COVID-19 pandemic was to ensure the safety and well-being of our seniors, particularly those residing in long-term care facilities.  We implemented a range of protective protocols and worked with families to ensure that residents could stay connected to those that love and care for them.  As the COVID pandemic response carries on, we will continue to deliver the services that seniors rely on.  We are collaborating with community agencies and non-government organizations to ensure they are aware of the federal funding available to provide local support to seniors during this challenging time. We are also working with the NWT Seniors’ Society to ensure communication material related to COVID-19 gets out to seniors in their Indigenous languages. This material will hopefully increase their awareness of the situation and how they can protect themselves, as well as reduce their anxiety about contracting the coronavirus.  The Department of Health and Social Services is also currently revising and updating the Seniors Information Handbook, Mr. Speaker.  This is a valuable resource for seniors, and those who support them, that provide listings of available services from numerous helpful sources. This Handbook was developed in partnership with GNWT departments and the NWT Seniors’ Society, and is updated periodically. It is available as both a hardcopy handbook and online now, and the updated version is in progress.  In closing, I want to assure our NWT seniors that the GNWT remains committed to protecting their health and safety during this uncertain time, as well as moving forward. We will continue to work cooperatively with Indigenous governments, government agencies and non-governmental organizations to achieve our goal of providing quality services for our seniors to ensure their able enjoy long and happy lives, here in the NWT.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The goal of the new system is to focus on a more user-friendly experience, allowing the GNWT to better track and manage the lifecycle of an application, and enhance accountability. It will also help foreign nationals who start, purchase or invest in an existing business as outlined in the NWT Immigration Strategy, Building a Skilled Workforce and Vibrant Economy 2017-2022. A recently developed Welcome to the NWT resource booklet will also assist in the attraction, settlement and retention of foreign nationals to the NWT. This booklet describes everything from initial checklists to schools, communities and cultures, employment, services, healthcare and weather. It is a comprehensive, plainly written resource available in both English and French.  The new online application system will support the population growth of the NWT. It will also be showcased in the launch of a campaign to attract foreign nationals abroad and already living and working in Canada, to help fill the critical labour market gaps in the NWT with skilled workers.  Quotes: 						“There are many people interested in living and working in the Northwest Territories, who will bring much needed skills and new industry to our economy. The new online system will make the application process easier and quicker for Nominee Program applicants, helping us to assist employers in meeting critical labour market needs.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “Among the most important investments that can be made to stimulate opportunity and diversity with regards to the Northwest Territories economy, are those to attract a healthy vibrant population. We recognize the considerable contribution that newcomers and immigrants can make to our territory and welcome those interested in making the North home. This new platform has been created to help meet this objective. 						- Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment Quick Facts: ·       Since 2016, the NWT has welcomed 17 business nominees, five of whom are currently operating their businesses in Hay River and 12 operating in Yellowknife. Together with their family members, these nominees bring new businesses services and numerous new residents to the territory.   ·       From 2009-2019, the Employer Stream of the Nominee Program has welcomed 427 nominees into the Northwest Territories. With their families, the total number of foreign nationals living and working in NWT communities is 819. ·       With NWT borders currently closed, we are seeing less foreign nationals able to travel to the NWT. The launch of the online application system allows people to start thinking about the immigration process as the decision to immigrate to a new country or territory takes months. It is important to continue raising the awareness of the NWT as a great place to live and work, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Simpson: Immigration and the Northwest Territories Nominee Program,"Mr. Speaker, we will defeat the scourge of COVID-19, and when we do, we will be better prepared to attract and welcome new residents. Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide an update on the new immigration related initiatives that the Department of Education, Culture and Employment has implemented or undertaken in the past six months, including an immigration settlement and integration pilot project, development of a new immigration stream, the creation of new resources for newcomers, and a refreshed website. I am also happy to officially announce the launch of the all new online application portal that will replace the current paper-based application process.  ECE delivers the Employer Stream of the Northwest Territories Nominee Program, which assists employers in filling workforce gaps with skilled and semi-skilled foreign nationals when local workers are not available. While the vast majority of the Nominees supported under the Nominee Program are already working in the Territory, we continue to receive requests for information from people around the world who are interested in coming here. The entry of foreign nationals into Canada is a federal responsibility so, like other provinces and territories, we work with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to ensure that processes and supports are in place when we welcome new residents to the Territory. In order to assist employers to build a skilled workforce while also supporting the immigration of foreign nationals who contribute to the economic development and success of the NWT, the Government of the Northwest Territories developed an Immigration Strategy, titled Building a Skilled Workforce and Vibrant Economy 2017-2022. Recent progress on the actions from the strategy include the development and implementation of a comprehensive marketing strategy to promote the NWT and the Nominee Program to both employers and foreign nationals at the local, national and international levels. We are also working to introduce a new program stream specific to Francophone foreign nationals, which we hope will encourage new residents to become a part of our vibrant francophone community in the North. With the input of local community organizations, we have developed a Welcome to the NWT resource booklet to provide key information to foreign nationals and newcomers on the services they need to settle, integrate and succeed in their new communities. This booklet shows newcomers what it is like to live here, and describes everything from initial checklists, to information on schools, community and government services, employment, healthcare, and weather. It is a very comprehensive, plainly written resource in both English and French and available on the ECE and immigratenwt.ca websites.  Mr. Speaker, the immigratenwt.ca website has been refreshed to a more vibrant story-centric site with testimonials, narratives and multimedia. It is one stop for all of the information we have on the Nominee Program, and now includes an online application portal.  The new online application system will be more user-friendly for the applicant, allow the departments to better track and manage the lifecycle of an application, and enhance accountability. It will eliminate the need for paper applications, while maintaining efficiency and improving the collection of information under the program.  Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased to note that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the Conseil de développement économique des Territoires du Nord-Ouest and the Fédération Franco-Ténoise are piloting the delivery of immigration settlement and integration services through an Integrated Service Centre for newcomers in Yellowknife. The goal of the pilot is to enhance the coordination and delivery of settlement and integration services, provide a one-stop-shop for these services, and support the success and retention of newcomer immigrants in the NWT. The Centre officially opened in December 2019 and will continue in pilot for the remainder of the 2020-2021 fiscal year. To improve partnerships with immigration stakeholders we are holding semi-annual meetings with federally-funded Settlement Service Providers and offering information sessions and resources to newcomers and employers.  Mr. Speaker, from 2009-2019, the Employer Stream of the Nominee Program has welcomed 427 nominees to the territory. With their families, the total number is 819 people attending school, shopping at our stores, and contributing to their communities.   Since 2016, the Business Stream of the Nominee Program, delivered by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment, welcomed 17 business nominees. Five are currently operating their businesses in Hay River and 12 are operating in Yellowknife. Together with their family members, these nominees bring new business services and a number of new residents to the territory.   Mr. Speaker, we continue to have requests for information from potential new residents to come to the NWT to live, work and contribute to a growing economy. Now more than ever, addressing workforce gaps and supporting the development of a strong labour market is critical to the territory’s economic future. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
196,2020-06-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-mining-week-2020,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Mining Week 2020,"Check Against Delivery   Mr. Speaker, every June the Government of the Northwest Territories, together with the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Chamber of Mines, and the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission of the NWT and Nunavut, mark mining week in our Territory.  This year will be no exception. From June 21st to 27th we will, once again, recognize this industry that is a foundation of our economy. What will be different this year is that with COVID-19 restrictions in place, Mining Week will take place entirely online. A robust calendar of social media content is being planned. A dedicated mining week page on the Mining North website will provide access to geologist-led virtual rock walks, an opportunity to engage with representatives of the NWT Geological Survey, short videos, a kids activity booklet, and links to feature stories, infographics, and a list of resources and information. For its part, Mr. Speaker, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment’s Mineral and Petroleum Resources Division will be introducing an App with two guided walking tours that we hope will encourage the public to explore our local geology. One walking tour will feature the Ranney Hill Trail, while the second will walk participants through downtown Yellowknife. Both will highlight and offer information on this region’s varied geology and the rich mining industry that it has sustained. Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to mark mining week this year, I would also like to recognize the importance of not just our diamond mines, but the exploration companies and prospectors that also make up our resource sector.   Just as it underpinned our economy before the pandemic struck, we will need mining, exploration and development to anchor our economic recovery from COVID-19. Mining and exploration has always been the biggest source of private sector jobs and income for our residents. When they return to full operations or when new projects advance they will, once again, be major buyers of products and services from NWT companies and employers to our residents. We recognize that these are trying times, and, beyond addressing health and safety concerns as a first priority, we have worked to protect the livelihood of NWT residents and the many associated businesses working in our resource industry. Like we have with all sectors of the NWT economy, we continue to consider how we can best support our mineral sector through this period of reduced or limited activity.  We initially suspended payment and work requirements to protect mineral tenure holders until the end of June.  I am happy today to announce that this relief is being extended for another three months until September 24th. This is an ongoing interim measure while we continue to work on more fulsome relief measures that require legislative change and consultation with our Indigenous partners, including those who share in the NWT’s resource revenues. We have also made changes to our Mining Incentive Program to strengthen our support this year for proposed mineral exploration projects.   Overall, priority will be given to projects that offer the greatest potential to advance both mineral exploration and economic recovery in the NWT.  Applicants are being advised to improve the attractiveness of their applications by committing to use services provided by NWT businesses and contractors to conduct most or all components of their work.  Mr. Speaker, through this COVID pandemic, our resource companies and their contractor partners have, once again, proven themselves to be strong corporate citizens. In particular, our diamond mines have worked with the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer and the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission to identify and put into practice very stringent guidelines and conditions governing the movement and interactions of their workforces. I want to thank them for their continued commitment to our territory.   Mr. Speaker, I have committed to being a strong advocate for our mining sector, and I stand by that today. I encourage all Members of the Legislative Assembly to seek out the online presentations and resources events that will mark Mining Week beginning on June 21st; and to take some time to acknowledge the opportunities and benefits which have been afforded to our Territory by our historic relationships with mining.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Some functions or activities were delayed as more urgent tasks took over and staff were redeployed. Yet as we begin to take stock of the last few months, there are both challenges and opportunities that have appeared. I want to speak today on the response and emerging opportunities within Court Services and Corrections.  Our correctional facilities have implemented numerous measures including modifying intake assessment procedures and practicing physical distancing. The Department worked closely with the Chief Public Health Officer on developing new protocols.  One of the first and more critical responses to COVID-19 was to reduce the number of inmates at the Correctional facilities. With support and cooperation from all those who work within the justice system including the judiciary, the Federal Public Prosecution Service and the Defense bar, there has been a strong focus on some of the core principles of both judicial interim release, or bail, and sentencing to ensure that only those who must by law be separated from society are directed to the Correctional facilities. Within the Department of Justice, we are ensuring that inmates who are eligible for temporary absence release are aware of their opportunity to apply, have support from case officers to make those applications, and will have those applications examined promptly.  The application process for temporary absences includes a thorough risk assessment because one of the goals of the Correctional Service is to preserve public safety. But it has been an opportunity for many individuals nearing the end of their formal custodial sentence to complete their period of rehabilitation outside the walls of the correctional facility. All of this work monitoring access to bail and supporting applications for temporary release, can continue past the current COVID-19 measures.  Another challenge that we are still facing is the lack of internet services available to inmates. For safety reasons, inmates do not have unrestricted access to the internet. With visits cancelled in order to reduce the risk of an outbreak in our correctional facilities, this created a very real challenge to ensuring that inmates can keep in contact with their loved ones. The Department of Justice has responded by bringing in dedicated lines that can be set up to facilitate virtual contact sessions. Looking forward, this improved connectivity could also help facilitate access to new and innovative education and programming opportunities.   Court Services have also implemented measures to allow court operations to continue in accordance with the protocols set by the Chief Public Health Officer, and as directed by the Judiciary.  To reduce the number of people present in a courtroom, hearings are only being held for urgent matters, and video appearances and videoconferencing are being utilized where feasible. Court circuits have been postponed to protect our communities. Additionally, we have reduced the hours of our Court Registries and installed depositories for the safe drop-off of court documents to protect both staff and the public.   Like other jurisdictions across the country, we are now examining how technology worked for us during the pandemic and considering how we may be able to continue to provide the Court with flexible tools so there are options available in the future. The pandemic forced an increased reliance on technology for the delivery of Court Services, but going forward we have an opportunity to decide how technology can mean better service for the people of the Northwest Territories. That can include not only the efforts made to date but also looking at where we can continue to grow, including improvements to video and other telecommunication processes and electronic filing opportunities. Mr. Speaker, Court Services and Corrections were not the only divisions within the Department of Justice impacted by COVID-19 and that worked to deliver a swift response. Lawyers in Legal Division have been called on to provide opinions and draft documents in a situation without precedent; Community Corrections has worked to deliver their programs even when our method of community engagement has been upended; Legal Registries and the Public Trustee developed new work processes and found new ways to interact with clients. In every case, we are seeing some of our challenges more acutely but also seeing opportunities for improved service delivery and innovative responses. The Department of Justice will continue to ensure health and safety first for all residents and will also continue to grow the creativity and innovation that has been a part of our response to COVID-19. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
198,2020-06-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/release-integrated-case-management-program-evaluation-and-social-return-investment-report,Government Website,Release of the Integrated Case Management Program Evaluation and Social Return on Investment Report,"Minister of Justice Caroline Wawzonek released a third-party program evaluation and social return on investment (SROI) study on the Integrated Case Management Pilot Program in Yellowknife.   The goal of the study was to determine the social value created by the ICM pilot program and how we might apply the lessons learned from it to how we continue to provide services to residents of the Northwest Territories, as well as providing those lessons to other service providers.  The study undertook a rigorous methodology of data analytics along with a careful review of case files, interview data, frontline service provider data and program participant testimony.    The conservatively calculated ratio concluded that for every dollar the GNWT invested in the ICM Program, it resulted in at least $4.50 of value.   Most of this value is returned to ICM participants (56% or $2.52) but a significant portion is returned to the GNWT as well (29% or $1.31), with  additional value generated for children and families of ICM participants (14% or $.66) as well. The ICM Program funding has been included as an on-going budget in the 2020/21 Main Estimates before the 19th Legislative Assembly for review.  The program will continue to work with its community and government partners to support program participants out of crisis and towards greater self-sufficiency. The outcomes from this study reinforce that much of the program’s success lies in the way that service is provided and how people are treated rather than solely on the availability of Pathfinders. Evidence from this study and many others show that equity, flexibility and person-centered service make up the foundation to effectively support people living with complex social challenges.  The Department of Justice, along with support from GNWT partners, is committed to making the move towards Integrated Service Delivery (ISD) a priority.  For the past four years, an inter-departmental group within the GNWT has been working on ways to move ISD forward in the territory, with a focus on the principles of person-centered service delivery.  In collaboration with its social envelope partner departments, the Department of Justice has recently staffed a Territorial Director of Integrated Service Delivery position to lead the initiative.   Quotes “As Minister of Justice, I fully support Integrated Case Management.  This program is integral in supporting the individuals and families in our community struggling the most to access the supports they need. It is not enough that government services are available; they must be accessible and delivered in a timely and flexible manner that recognizes that not everyone starts from the same point, and ensures all members of the community are treated with dignity and respect.” -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Justice Quick Facts ·       What is an SROI? An SROI is a methodology that determines the outcomes associated with a program, and then assigns values for these program outcomes to determine how much the social value has created . The goal is to calculate a ratio, or the “social return on investment”; for instance, a 3:1 ratio would indicate that for each dollar invested in the program, 3 dollars’ worth of social value are being created. ·       It was determined that for every $1 spent on ICM, $4.50 worth of social good is created, with 29% of this value returned directly to the GNWT.  ·       Demographics of participants (248 active program participants): o   54% female/46% male  o   Medium age 44 years o   55% from Yellowknife (either born and raised or been in Yellowknife more than five years) o   Self-identified identity: §  20% Inuit or Inuvialuit  §  52% First Nations  §  6% Metis §  14% non-Indigenous. ·       The study provided data to support several successes of the program so far, including:  flexibility and availability of support to participants building trust between Pathfinders and program participants and increased self-sufficiency of participants. ·       The study found that program participants feel that ICM support has been the cause of positive changes in their lives. ·       The study found that the majority of other service providers found that ICM alleviated pressure from their workload. ·       All interviewees for the study were randomly selected by the contractor by using a statistical technique to ensure the interviewees were part of key clusters of similar program participants.  This helped to ensure a balanced cross section of perspectives. ·       Of the 217 participants that had significant interactions with the ICM program, 80% are ·       Indigenous, 54% are female, the median age is 44, and 99 have children (with a total of 203 children of participants). ·       ICM participants face significant challenges when they enter the program—80% are unemployed, 65% are residential school survivors or had family that attended residential schools, 70% experience mental health issues, and 53% struggle with substance use.   Media Contact Sue Glowach Senior Communications Advisor Department of Justice Government of the Northwest Territories  Email: sue_glowach@gov.nt.ca "

200,2020-06-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-emergency-management-organization-and-community-and-indigenous-engagement,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: The Emergency Management Organization and Community and Indigenous  Engagement on COVID-19 Response,"Check Against Delivery   Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis on a level the world has not seen in generations. Taking action to slow its spread and protect public health has required leadership from all levels of government. Today I would like to highlight the work that has been done by the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs and the Emergency Management Organization in response to COVID-19. The Department of Municipal and Community Affairs, or MACA, has the mandated responsibility for public safety within the Northwest Territories. To accomplish this, MACA  houses the Emergency Management Organization, which provides guidance and coordination for our Government and our partners to respond to territorial emergencies. Each government department and external agency continues to be responsible for its own operations and decisions, but by having members of each department attend the meetings, the Emergency Management Organization provides a forum for discussing what they are doing and making sure their plans align in a coordinated manner.  The Emergency Management Organization, or EMO, is also responsible for making sure that all members have good, timely information about the full scope of the emergency response and for identifying potential gaps or the need for additional resources.  Typically, the focus for the EMO would be emergencies like floods or fires that only affect a portion of the Northwest Territories and are over relatively quickly. The COVID-19 pandemic is different in that it has affected everybody in the territory, has gone on for many months, and projected to last for some time. This has required the EMO to take on additional tasks and responsibilities that are unique to this pandemic.  Specifically the EMO has established and maintained all isolation centres in the four regional centres – Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River, and Fort Smith. In addition, EMO is supporting check points at airports and highways to keep track of who is entering the territory and make sure they know about our public health requirements.  The EMO also supports the 8-1-1 Support Line. Residents can dial this one easy number and select one of three options - general information on COVID-19 in the NWT, Protect NWT to raise issues of compliance for the Enforcement Task force and the third to inquire about available service and support in Communities. EMO operators answer the calls on community supports.  The EMO is also working to obtain and distribute Personal Protective Equipment for non- medical essential workers, non-government organizations, community governments and Indigenous governments. Community and Indigenous governments have supported these efforts by completing needs assessments to identify their personal protective equipment needs.  Mr. Speaker, community and Indigenous governments have also been affected by COVID-19 and have needed to adjust their operations and how they serve their residents. Since mid-March the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs has worked with Senior Administration Officers and Band Managers to identify and monitor impacts to communities as a result of COVID-19, share information, update community emergency plans and ensure continuity of emergency and essential services. These have included practical challenges such as holding council meetings remotely and making the required changes to bylaws to do so and helping community governments understand how the Chief Public Health Officer orders affect them.  As well, I have held weekly virtual town hall meetings with community and Indigenous government leaders since the beginning of the pandemic to provide a forum to hear and answer their concerns. Other Ministers and GNWT officials have also joined me at these meetings to answer questions leaders have had about specific topics.  Our government is extremely grateful for the support municipal and indigenous governments have provided residents since the beginning of this pandemic.  These governments are doing all they can to assist residents and we would not be where we are without their support.  I would also like to say thank you to all staff from the various departments who are involved with the EMO, all those who have voluntarily redeployed from other departments and agencies to support the response efforts, regional MACA staff who are continuing their direct engagement with communities, our management team who have worked non-stop since this began and, all those supporting the EMO and health efforts. Only by working together, to identify and address gaps in our plans, have we been able to keep this pandemic at bay and protect the residents of the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, we have faced many emergencies in the past, but none have measured in comparison to COVID-19. This pandemic is not over, but by each of us doing our part to abide by the Chief Public Health Officer orders, and all stakeholders working together through the Emergency Management Organization, we will be better prepared as we plan for a potential second wave in the fall.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
201,2020-06-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-covid-19-travel-restrictions,Government Website,Diane Thom: COVID-19 Travel Restrictions,"Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 has affected all areas of social and economic activity in the Northwest Territories and around the world. As the pandemic has evolved and jurisdictions have been able to manage its spread, all governments are looking at the public health measures that have been put in place and are continuing to adjust them.  One area of significant interest to our government and to all people and communities in the Northwest Territories is travel.  Due to the restrictions the Chief Public Health Officer placed on travel early on, we have been fortunate in the territory to have only seen five cases of COVID-19 so far. While our strategy of restricting travel has clearly been a success when it comes to protecting public health, we have to recognize that it is a serious step and there are some significant legal limits and considerations that need to be respected. One of those legal limits is the requirement to respect the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees on freedom of mobility.  The Charter gives all Canadians the right to travel freely throughout Canada, and the Government of the Northwest Territories does not have the legal authority to override that.  Although this means that our government cannot close the borders to Canadian residents, it does not prevent us from placing restrictions and conditions on travel by people once they are in the Northwest Territories.  This is what we have done under a public health order issued by the Chief Public Health Officer.  Under the current orders, all travelers entering the NWT are greeted at a checkpoint by a Border Officer.  The Border Officer collects their information, and if they do not meet an identified exemption, informs them of the NWT’s public health travel restrictions – including the requirement for anyone entering to self-isolate for 14 days.  Travellers have the opportunity to voluntarily turn around. If they choose not to, they are informed that they must seek an exceptional circumstances exemption, and immediately self-isolate if they wish to proceed further in the Northwest Territories.  This is a shift in how the current order was being implemented, Mr. Speaker.  Before May 29, border officials asked people to turn around and return to their destination if they did not fit an existing exemption in order to meet our objectives. Following legal developments in Southern Canada challenging similar actions in Newfoundland and Labrador, we realized we needed to take steps to more closely align implementation of our order with the mobility provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  When I, or the Premier, have spoken about travel restrictions, we have spoken about different aspects of the same order.  The bottom line is that our government cannot prevent people from entering the Northwest Territories, but we can restrict and prohibit their movements once they are in the Northwest Territories.  Travel restrictions are a legitimate and necessary measure to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact on Northwest Territories residents, communities and the health care system.  We will continue to maintain travel restrictions so long as they are necessary to protect our residents.  We will also continue the requirement for people to self-isolate in one of the four regional self-isolation communities, if they have entered from outside the territory. Our plan is to continue to cover the costs for people who need to access one of our self-isolation centres for Northwest Territories residents, but we will be asking 	non-NWT residents to cover the cost of their stay themselves. Mr. Speaker, we recognize that our public health measures have to adjust to meet the realities on the ground.  As the threat of the pandemic changes, we will review our measures and adjust them to reflect the current situation.  We will also continue to strive to make sure our orders are in line with all the necessary legal requirements and that the way we describe them are clear and accurate.  COVID-19 is a dynamic situation and how we have responded has changed.  It will continue to change, Mr. Speaker, and so will the way we describe our response publicly.  We recognize that this can be confusing for people, but we will commit to doing a better job to explain those changes as soon as we make them, and speak about them as clearly and directly as possible.  We have two different changes coming on Friday, Mr. Speaker.  One change is to the travel restrictions that I have been speaking about this afternoon.  As I have said, these changes will line up better with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and will more clearly address leisure travel within the territory.  The second change will be the implementation of phase two of relaxing restrictions under our Emerging Wisely plan.  I know that all Members, and all residents of the Northwest Territories, are looking forward to phase two.  We will be briefing Members on phase two tomorrow, Mr. Speaker, and making a public announcement on Friday afternoon. While we are able to start revising our public health measures as the pandemic evolves, Mr. Speaker, I want to remind all residents that COVID-19 is not over and we must still be cautious, and follow the direction and guidance issued by the Chief Public Health Officer to keep our territory safe.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

If they choose not to, they are informed that they must seek an exceptional circumstances exemption, and immediately self-isolate if they wish to proceed further in the NWT.  “This is a shift in how the order was being implemented through May 29, and reflects an effort to more closely align implementation of the order with the mobility provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  “Prior to May 29, border officials asked people to turn around and return to their destination if they did not fit an existing exemption in order to meet our objectives.  “The process outlined above is an interim measure and the CPHO and her team are working diligently on amendments to our travel restriction and self-isolation order to more transparently protect mobility rights under the Charter.  ‘In an interview with CBC Television on Monday, June 8, Premier Cochrane was asked if tourism was “off the table” for the NWT. The Premier answered that tourism was on the table, so long as people self-isolated for 14 days, which is consistent with how CPHO orders are currently being implemented.  ‘While the GNWT approach to tourism during the pandemic is still developing, the NWT is expecting to establish a travel bubble with Nunavut as part of its new travel orders and will be encouraging tourism by residents of both territories.  ‘The Premiers comments were made in the context of the current understanding of Charter limitations on the CPHO’s powers and the intention to promote tourism among NWT and Nunavut residents.  ‘While it will respect the right of any Canadian resident to enter the territory, the GNWT will still be enforcing the CPHO’s legitimate orders to restrict travel within the territory, including restrictions on leisure travel within the territory, to ensure that the health of all NWT residents and communities is protected.  “As stated in the House yesterday, new travel orders are expected to be implemented with Phase 2 of the Emerging Wisely Plan and when details of those orders are finalized, they will be thoroughly explained to NWT residents and the media.”"

Both extensions will take effect as of June 10, 2020 and expire on June 23, 2020. Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Kami Kandola.  Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. NWT residents entering the NWT are still required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith before travelling to their home community.  In order to ensure we can maintain ongoing support of the Public Heath orders, including checkpoints and isolation centres, as well as the ability to respond to any potential new cases and the impacts that might arise, it is necessary to continue to maintain a Public Health Emergency and State of Emergency.  While the Northwest Territories is currently in containment mode, with no evidence of community spread and all cases recovered, the situation can change quickly without carefully managing the continued response.    Nationwide spread is the biggest risk of expanding spread within the Northwest Territories and Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably across Canada.

207,2020-06-09,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-aurora-college-covid-19-response-and-beyond,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Aurora College COVID-19 Response and Beyond,"Check Against Delivery   Mr. Speaker, when students at Aurora College left for March break they were unaware of the uncertainty that the pandemic would bring to so many aspects of their lives, including if they would remain on track to achieve their education and career goals. I would like to share with you today some of the challenges and innovative solutions that the team at Aurora College implemented to support their students and their communities. When the pandemic hit the Northwest Territories, all Aurora College programming was temporarily suspended while the College team planned and executed a fundamental shift in how they would teach. In a two week period, Aurora College transitioned from classroom-based learning to a distance learning format for all of its full-time certificate, diploma and degree programs. Through innovation and determination on the part of instructors, the majority of students remained on track to complete their semester. Mr. Speaker, students who previously relied on access to a shared computer lab faced the challenge of not having the technology typically required to learn from a distance. In response to this challenge, Aurora College collaborated with Computers for Schools to provide computers to students who identified they needed one to continue their studies.   All throughout these changes to  the program delivery, the College continued to consider how suspended and cancelled programs might restart, and the Aurora College team stayed in touch and followed up with affected students to support their continued educational journey ensuring continued relationships between the students and staff during this difficult time of transition.  Mr. Speaker, in addition to a monumental shift in their teaching method, Aurora College was also able to assist with the broader Government of the Northwest Territories’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Student housing in Fort Smith was repurposed to accommodate travellers returning to the Northwest Territories who needed to isolate for 14 days. In addition, the Aurora College Centre for Mine and Industry Training facility became the solution to address the need for a drive-through COVID-19 testing site for the Department of Health and Social Services.  At the Yellowknife-North Slave campus, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing staff stepped-up to inventory medical equipment and supplies used in that program and designated for use by health authorities if required. Aurora College engaged with the Department of Health and Social Services to determine how current students in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Practical Nursing Diploma, and Personal Support Worker programs could play a role in the emergency response at health care facilities. These students also participated in the emergency response either through casual employment or through their scheduled practicum. There have also been engagements with Education, Culture and Employment to determine how students in the Early Childhood Development program could support the re-opening of day care facilities under emergency conditions.  Mr. Speaker, at the Inuvik Campus, the Arts, Crafts and Technology Micro-Manufacturing Centre has been using 3D printers to make mask tension relievers for hospital workers, and developing prototypes for door openers that allow you to open a door with your arm instead of hand. In addition, it has all the supplies and is on stand-by to produce face shields should they be required. As well, the single-student housing facility is being provided as a temporary solution to address the emergency isolation needs of the town’s vulnerable population.  Mr. Speaker, as the College plans for how to deliver programming in the fall of 2020, their primary responsibility remains the health and safety of students, staff and residents. In response to the Government of the Northwest Territories’ Emerging Wisely reopening plan and to its ongoing commitment to student success, the majority of Aurora College programs and courses offered in the 2020 fall semester will be delivered entirely by distance learning. Acknowledging the importance of hands-on and face-to-face learning, Aurora College continues to determine how and when critical in-person programming can happen based on advice from Office of the Chief Public Health Officer and the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission. Mr. Speaker, all of the challenges faced and changes made have strengthened the College and shown that the institution is ready and capable of making the changes necessary to transform into a polytechnic university. The transformation remains on target and is more important than ever for the Northwest Territories.   There are wide ranging benefits to establishing a polytechnic university in the Northwest Territories, many of which could contribute to the social and economic recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The combined short and long-term benefits could make the transformation a focal point for drawing post-COVID related investment, primarily from the Government of Canada, but it may also draw attention from wide-ranging sources.  Mr. Speaker, Aurora College currently serves a student population that is 75 per cent Indigenous and oversees several academic and research programs in partnership with Indigenous governments. Engaging our Indigenous partners in a meaningful way in transformation is critical to its success. That is why I have written to Indigenous leaders to collaborate on an approach to how and when they are engaged in the transformation based on the principles of United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It is also important to highlight that what we are building is a post-secondary institution that reflects the values and interests of our residents. Beyond the simple mechanics of economic stimulus, residents must be inspired by new short and long-term opportunities. Mr. Speaker, in closing I would like to say that despite the additional challenges Aurora College students have faced, it has been heartening to see their continued dedication to advancing their education. I also have to congratulate all of the Aurora College graduates of 2020 who, in the face of adversity, successfully completed their programs. They should be very proud of their achievement.

From medical personnel, to the folks stocking shelves and keeping the grocery stores open, to the water and fuel delivery staff and the officers in our communities and at the borders – I am grateful to you all for this selfless work. It is because you are at work that others, in fact, much of the Government of the Northwest Territories workforce, have been able to work remotely through this crisis.  Mr. Speaker, it has indeed been a challenge with so many people working from home – many with added responsibilities – to ensure each department can continue to fulfill its critical functions. From processing applications for land leases, to issuing permits for wildlife and forestry, and keeping the lights on across the Northwest Territories, has required extra time and attention.  For the Northwest Territories Power Corporation, this includes new protocols for entering communities and performing emergency work or required maintenance. Importantly, this also means working with the Emergency Measures Office to acquire Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to keep those essential workers safe. COVID-19 has changed the way we work, but the work to protect our land, water and air must continue. Staff at the departments of Lands and Environment and Natural Resources has worked diligently to develop new protocols to ensure the important work of protecting our environment and managing land use can continue in a way that is safe for our employees and residents. This includes new ways of carrying out inspections; research and environmental monitoring while maintaining physical distance and respecting the public health orders that are in place. Environmental assessments are a critical part of our regulatory system in the Northwest Territories, and involve a high level of coordination between departments, agencies and Indigenous governments. Despite the challenges caused by the pandemic, I am proud to say we are on track to meet the legislated timeline of June 06, 2020, to complete our response the Review Board on the Diavik Environmental Assessment.   As you know, Mr. Speaker, many northerners are going out on the land in response to COVID-19.  As a result, Environment and Natural Resources and Lands officers have increased wildlife monitoring, enforcement activities and inspections.  And of course, the way we fight fires this summer will be unlike any other season before. Environment and Natural Resources has been preparing for months, reviewing best practices in other jurisdictions and adapting our operations to reduce the risks to our staff and our communities. On top of their regular duties, many of our Environment and Natural Resources and Lands officers have also stepped up to support the larger Government of the Northwest Territories-wide effort to combat the spread of COVID-19. These efforts are critical to keeping our families and communities safe and healthy. Between Environment and Natural Resources and Lands, well over 70 staff have taken on extra duties or lent their expertise to other departments over the last couple of months, notably the Emergency Management Organization, the COVID Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce and at border crossing check stations. The level of collaboration and cooperation throughout the Government of the Northwest Territories has been incredible. At Lands alone, a full 25 per cent of the department’s employees are on redeployment or reassignment as part of the COVID-19 efforts. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to give a special shout out to Environment and Natural Resources’ Taiga Environmental Laboratory. The lab has been hard at work in recent weeks producing hand sanitizer for our frontline workers, including the officers I just mentioned.  Getting the supplies and the okay from Health Canada to produce took a lot of time and effort but it is truly paying off. At last count, the lab has produced more than 4,000 litres of hand sanitizer! Mr. Speaker, the physical distancing and isolation measures put in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 have created new and very real economic stress on Northwest Territories residents, families, businesses, Indigenous governments and communities.  That’s why the Department of Lands is helping to ease some of the burden by waiving rent for leaseholders on public land, for the fiscal year 2020-2021.  Looking forward, we hope to be able to open our regional and local offices to the public very soon under appropriate health order protocols. And that’s not all. To help customers impacted by the crisis, Northwest Territories Power Corporation removed all load limiters, suspended disconnections and collection activity.   At the same time, Northwest Territories Power Corporation is coordinating their response with its counterparts across the country and with the territorial Emergency Management Organization.  Through it all, Northwest Territories Power Corporation is keeping its workers safe while maintaining optimum service levels for Northwest Territories residents. I am grateful to the many individuals across my departments who have taken on extra duties to ensure we continue to protect our land, air and water and ensure the wise use of our natural resources. I appreciate your commitment to the important work we do.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The two-page document covers topics on everyone’s mind like mass-testing, rapid testing, and asymptomatic testing – providing a rationale for the territory’s decisions on each.  Testing is the foundation of good pandemic response – allowing health professionals to identify, trace, and isolate cases and contacts to minimize community risk.  From the start, the Northwest Territories has had one of the most aggressive testing strategies in the country – testing those without travel connections and expanding symptoms before other jurisdictions.  The territory will continue to get supplies in-place as test traffic is lower to continue meeting that standard as additional waves of COVID-19 arrive.     Quote “As we continue our pandemic response, residents want to see exactly how we’ll continue to rise to this challenge. This short document clears up some misconceptions, outlines our approach, and explains how it will keep us safe. And it underscores just how important it is to stay vigilant – especially as we ease our public health measures – because we’re in this for the long-haul, and now is the time to prepare.”  -Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services  Quick Facts  The Northwest Territories is testing at a rate of 466 per 10,000 in population.  Asymptomatic testing will not be applied on a wide-scale basis – only with priority populations like health care workers entering the territory to reduce risk.  This is because asymptomatic testing offers too much risk of false negatives and a false sense of security which then encourages riskier behaviours.  GeneXpert rapid testing kits are arriving and being set up in the territory. Mine sites in the Northwest Territories have their own testing strategies they are using to screen workers.

217,2020-06-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-housing-and-homelessness-response-covid-19,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Housing and Homelessness Response to COVID-19,"Mr. Speaker, we recognize that supporting vulnerable residents in need of housing or at risk of homelessness across the Northwest Territories is an essential part of the overall response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.  The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation has been working to ensure that we meet the needs of our residents during this difficult and challenging time.  The need for social distancing due to COVID-19 had a significant impact on how we support our residents and highlighted the need for all of us to work together, respect one another and be sources of hope in these trying times. To support meeting the housing and shelter needs of Northwest Territories residents during this pandemic, the Government of the Northwest Territories announced $5 million to support initiatives that recognize that vulnerable residents have limited ability to self-isolate safely.  This included $1.4 million to create housing for persons at risk or persons experiencing homelessness to self-isolate, and $3.6 million to bring on stream up to approximately 130 units across the Northwest Territories that were either available for occupancy or in need of renovations to meet the core housing needs.  Now that these units are no longer required by the Emergency Management Organization, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation is in the process of re-allocating these units to the Corporation’s rental programs:  Public housing, market rental and affordable rental or to support homeownership.  The re-allocation of these units will help in alleviating overcrowding in smaller communities.  Some 60 of these units are available for immediate allocation.  The introduction of these units will decrease the waiting lists across the NWT and make us better prepared should there be a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Speaker, we also recognized that some residents were facing economic challenges due to this virus.  To meet that need, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation enhanced the Transitional Rent Supplement Program by extending the program to August, streamlining the application process, and simplified requirements for participants.   Where there were approximately 40 program participants last year, this program is now helping almost 150 households. One of the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic is that the sudden loss of income could lead to residents being at risk of homelessness.  In anticipation of that, we increased the budget for the Homelessness Assistance Fund from $125,000 to $300,000.  This program provides financial assistance for the private rental market for people to find stable housing.  We have been working to ensure that these applications are processed as quickly as possible, as we know that these times are extremely stressful for our residents. Mr. Speaker, we have been working with community partners to access buildings to help serve as isolation centres for those vulnerable people who are at greater risks to contract COVID-19.  Under this action, we leased Aspen Apartments from the federal government that has provided 36 units in Yellowknife; and we have accommodated up to 18 people to be sheltered and experiencing homelessness at the North Country Inn in Hay River.  During this pandemic period, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation continues to be accessible to residents even with the realities of many working remotely.  As such, emergency hotlines were set up for homelessness assistance, emergency repair and access to the Transitional Rent Supplement Program. Mr. Speaker, as we begin recovery, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation will be an important contributor to the economic recovery of the Northwest Territories.  We will be working with communities to ensure that construction, renovation and repair work is done in a safe and considerate manner and bring in much needed economic benefits to our small communities. Lastly, even though we have entered into Stage 1 of the pandemic recovery plan, I would like to remind our tenants that the risks posed by COVID-19 are not over.  I know that with the easing of some social distancing, we want to gather and spend time with friends and families, but we all need to follow the directions of the Chief Public Health Officer.  So, let us  be considerate, be helpful, be kind, and keep washing our hands. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take the opportunity to thank all Northwest Territories Housing Corporation staff and the Local Housing Authorities who have been creative, flexible and responsive throughout this pandemic.  They have gone above and beyond to provide direct, appropriate assistance to all residents of the Northwest Territories. Your time, energy and countless hours are extremely appreciated.   Mahsi, Mr. Speaker."
218,2020-06-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-inuvialuit-day-and-national-indigenous-peoples-day,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Inuvialuit Day and National Indigenous Peoples Day,"Mr. Speaker, I know that renewing our government’s relationship with Indigenous governments is important to all Members. That is why the 19th Legislative Assembly has established settling and implementing treaty, land, resources and self-government agreements as one of its priorities. We have also made it a priority to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.   On June 5th each year, we commemorate Inuvialuit Day to celebrate the signing of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement in 1984.  In many ways, this agreement led the way for the future negotiation of land, resources and self-government agreements in the Northwest Territories and, perhaps, all of Canada.  The Inuvialuit Final Agreement was the first comprehensive land claim agreement north of the 60th parallel and only the second of its kind in Canada.   The Final Agreement designates over 90,000 square kilometres of land as the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and includes close to 13,000 square kilometres of subsurface ownership and certain wildlife harvesting rights within the region. The agreement also established the Inuvialuit Development Corporation to support Inuvialuit self-reliance by providing a solid economic base that allows them to participate fully in the Canadian economy.  Just as importantly, the Final Agreement gave Inuvialuit a guaranteed right to participate in important decisions affecting the Inuvialuit Settlement Region: it established the Inuvialuit Game Council, ensured Inuvialuit participation on co-management boards, and led to the creation of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation.  To this day, the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation remains one of this government’s most important and valued partners. The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation was the first Indigenous government to join with our government in signing on to the Devolution Agreement-in-Principle in January 2011, and their support and participation in the negotiation of the final agreement was invaluable to our government.  The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation continues to be a strong supporter and ally as a member of the Intergovernmental Council on Lands and Resource Management.   Following Devolution, the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation and our government jointly advocated to Canada for a start to Arctic offshore oil and gas accord negotiations, as called for in the Devolution Agreement. These negotiations began in the spring of 2019, and the GNWT and the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation share an interest in bringing more decision-making authority to the North as part of the accord.  Earlier this year we celebrated Gwich’in Day. Later this summer, we celebrate two additional important landmarks for the people of the Northwest Territories. Sahtu Day on June 23rd will mark the 27th anniversary of the signing of the Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement, and August 4th will mark the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Tłı̨chǫ Agreement.  We look forward to recognizing these accomplishments with our Indigenous government partners, and continuing to build on the vision of reconciliation expressed in these agreements.   On June 21st, we will also celebrate National Indigenous People’s Day. This is a day to celebrate the first peoples of Canada, including the rich and diverse cultures of the Dene, Inuit and Métis peoples.  National Indigenous People’s Day also serves as a reminder that we are stronger, and more successful, when our public government works in collaboration with Indigenous governments throughout the Northwest Territories.  Mr. Speaker, our collaboration with the Inuvialuit, the Sahtu Secretariat Incorporated and the Tłı̨chǫ are just three examples of the government-to-government relationships we are building with all Indigenous governments of the Northwest Territories. We look forward to continuing to build and strengthen these particularly important relationships.  The future of the Northwest Territories depends on partnerships. One of the things that the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated is that we are all connected. Everybody has been affected by the pandemic, and all governments have had to work hard together to help protect the health of Northwest Territories residents.    Indigenous governments are a critical partner for us and that is why our government has been meeting weekly with them throughout the pandemic to discuss our response and how we can work together to serve our people. While this pandemic will not last, I look forward to continued close collaboration between the Government of the Northwest Territories and Indigenous governments in the years to come.   We ask all Members to join me in congratulating the Inuvialuit people on the 36th anniversary of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Simpson and the NWT Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) on June 3, 2020 to discuss priorities and planning for the upcoming 2020-2021 school year. Planning for re-entry into schools in the fall is ongoing, with ECE and education bodies actively working together on a coordinated, system-wide approach for the upcoming school year. This planning follows the detailed criteria provided by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) on how to safely reopen schools. How education is delivered will be different for each school and community, based on factors such as school size and layout, access to technology, and the number and ages of students and staff. It is likely that individual schools will be adjusting student transportation, food programs and even scheduling, depending on their ability to accommodate the public health recommendations. Education leaders have agreed on the following priorities for the 2020-2021 school year: Maintaining the health and safety of students, staff and communities Starting the school year on time Maximizing in-person learning, to the extent possible Seeking equity across regions Maintaining financial supports to schools Education bodies will be taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020, which could require a return to increased public health restrictions. All schools are working to have their detailed risk assessment plans for reopening submitted to the OCPHO in June 2020. A more formal outline of the 2020-21 school year will be available once these plans are approved. Quotes: “The upcoming 2020-2021 school year will not be a return to normal for education staff and students in the NWT. In order to ensure the health and safety of our students and educational staff, schools will be taking strong action to meet the recommendations of the Chief Public Health Officer, while providing a blended learning approach that will prioritize in-person learning wherever possible, and support at-home distance learning where required.” 	-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment “With guidance from the Department of Education, Culture and Employment and the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association, all NWT Education Bodies are presently evaluating their capacity to deliver a quality education program while meeting the public health recommendations. It’s a daunting task, but I am confident that by continuing to work together and keeping our sights set on the priorities we agreed upon, we will be ready to welcome students back for the upcoming school year.” 	- Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   Related Link: Emerging Wisely – Path to Eased Public Health Restrictions Media inquiries: Cabinet Communications 	Government of the Northwest Territoriespresssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

You’ll Need to Bring Your Own Non-Medical Mask,"Effective June 8th, 2020, Northwest Territories residents must bring their own non-medical masks to their flights in order to comply with Transport Canada regulations. Supplies of masks provided to airlines operating out of Yellowknife by the Department of Health and Social Services as a courtesy will soon be depleted. The requirement to provide your own non-medical mask is consistent with practices in other destinations across Canada. Passengers will not be allowed to board their flight without demonstrating that their non-medical face mask will adequately cover their mouths and noses for the duration of their flight with durable material like cotton. This is also consistent with broader public health recommendations. Dr. Kami Kandola, the NWT’s Chief Public Health Officer, strongly recommends non-medical masks for use in public places – especially those where maintaining physical distance of two metres is difficult. While a non-medical face mask does not protect the wearer in the same way a medical mask would, it does prevent your respiratory droplets from contaminating other people or landing on surfaces. An inventory of non-medical face mask manufacturers across the territory has been established for those wishing to purchase them. If you prefer to make them at home, they can be made with common materials and with-or-without sewing. Here are some tips on how.

The Final Report is split into two volumes with three main sections: Section 1 presents a comprehensive person and community-centered understanding of the crisis of violence experienced by Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ+ persons.   Section 2 takes a deeper look at topics that present distinct issues or perspectives.  It also describes opportunities to demonstrate, within a distinctions-based approach, how culture, health, security and justice can create particular challenges for specific groups, institutions, geographies, or other circumstances,. Section 3 focuses on different models of healing and Indigenous-led best practices. The report ends with the presentation of the 231 Calls for Justice covering a wide range of topics and themes including, culture, health and wellness and human security.  The Government of the Northwest Territories prepared an initial response to the Calls for Justice entitled Doing Our Part. While the GNWT did not respond to specific Calls for Justice in Doing Our Part, we provided a list of thematic sections related to each of the Calls for Justice highlighting the work we are already doing or can build upon.  We also set out a number of high-level questions that will need to be considered more fully by our government.  Then-Minister Cochrane tabled this report in the Legislative Assembly on August 22nd, 2019. To date, the GNWT remains the only jurisdiction in Canada that has prepared a response to the final report. The GNWT has also made a commitment to work with Canada on the development of the National Action Plan in a coordinated manner that involves all stakeholders.  The Minister of Crown-Indigenous Affairs had committed to having the national action plan developed by June 2020.  While that deadline has been pushed back due to circumstances related to COVID-19, the GNWT remains committed to working to move this work forward.  The GNWT has set up an interdepartmental working group for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls to coordinate our response to the Calls for Justice.  This working group is chaired by the Special Advisor to the Minister Responsible for the Status of Women and includes appointed representatives from the departments of Executive and Indigenous Affairs, Health and Social Services, Justice, Housing Corporation and Education, Culture and Employment.  Other departments are invited to meetings or asked for input, as required.  Mr. Speaker, the GNWT is aware that we cannot do this work alone.  Our government is committed to working with all Northerners and with partners across Canada to support the work needed to address systemic causes of violence, inequality and racism, so that Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ+ people are able to feel safe and empowered in our territory and in our country.  According to Statistics Canada, the Northwest Territories has the second highest rate of violence against women in the country.  As a government, we need to take the necessary steps to address the systemic causes of violence, inequality and racism that contribute to the problem in the Northwest Territories.  The Final Report shares stories we all need to hear: stories about someone’s sister, someone’s niece, someone’s mother, someone’s child.  Sadly, Indigenous women and girls in the NWT continue to live these stories.  Trying to put the pain that loved ones and communities deal with into perspective is difficult.  The NWT may be large geographically, but the events in one community can affect us all. That is why it is so important that we work together to address the ongoing violence being experienced by Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQ+ people.  It will require many people willing to work together to explore ways in which we can end violence that continues to have a negative impact on the lives of many NWT residents.  I recognize that change will not happen overnight but change MUST happen. Mr. Speaker, violence against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ+ people is not an individual problem or an issue only for certain communities.  This violence is rooted in systemic factors woven in the fabric of Canadian society like economic, social and political marginalization, as well as racism, discrimination and misogyny.  As the previous Minister Responsible for the Status of Women so eloquently put it and I quote “We must keep this issue at the forefront of people’s minds and consistently convey another truth: that Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ+ individuals are valued, loved and worthy of justice.” To conclude, I would like to acknowledge the courage and strength shown by those who agreed to share their “truths” with the National Commission.  I offer my thoughts, my prayers and my gratitude. Quana/mahsi, Mr. Speaker "

226,2020-06-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-2020-wildfire-season,Government Website,Shane Thompson: 2020 Wildfire Season,"Mr. Speaker, the wildfire season this year is off to a slow start thanks to cooler temperatures in May, right across the territory. It is only been in the last week or so that things are finally starting to warm up. Hot weather is predicted through June and July with temperatures well above normal. These are prime conditions for wildfire. As of this week, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources has responded to one wildfire in the Northwest Territories.  This fire is suspected to be human-caused and is under investigation.  Mr. Speaker, it is critical that residents use extreme caution with campfires while out on the land. This is especially important early in the season when the land is often dry. People planning to do spring brush or grass burning must get a burn permit, and make sure they have water and tools on hand to put it out. Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 presents some unique challenges this fire season. Staff at Environment and Natural Resources have been preparing for months, learning from other parts of the country whose fire seasons began weeks or months before our own, and establishing best practices to keep our fire crews and communities safe.  Large fires require a large response, Mr. Speaker, many people working closely together, eating and sleeping in close quarters. Physical distancing is not possible on your way to a fire, whether you are traveling by aircraft or by vehicle. Setting up pumps and pulling hose around a fire needs teamwork and people working alongside one another. That is why we have put in place new health and safety measures for our wildfire operations this year. Fitness testing and training and camp protocols have been modified to limit group sizes; new briefing formats keep face-to-face interactions to a minimum; and surfaces are more frequently cleaned and sanitized. We are also monitoring the health of our fire crews and staff on a daily basis. Mr. Speaker, wildfires also produce a lot of smoke which can be hard on residents with existing health conditions. In a worst case scenario, wildfires can require community evacuations. Physical distancing would be extremely challenging while evacuating large numbers of people, and add additional stress on communities, residents and emergency responders. This is why we have adjusted our wildfire response strategies this year to take into account the additional challenges of COVID-19. To limit the risks to our fire crews and communities, we will aim to catch fires early. We will also be more aggressive in how we fight fires to keep them as small as possible. As I mentioned, large fires require a large response, and we want to keep the number of crews on a fire to a minimum, and try to avoid bringing in crews from outside the Northwest Territories. Under certain conditions, we may also need to put in place fire bans to reduce human caused fires and consider restricting burning when the fire danger is moderate or higher. Mr. Speaker, it is important to recognize fire is an important and necessary part of the forest ecosystem. Historically, Environment and Natural Resources responds to less than half of the wildfires on the landscape in any given fire season. Each fire that is actioned increases the risk of fire in future years. That is because forest fuels build up to a point where controlling new fires becomes more challenging, and can result in greater human, financial and ecological impacts. While more fires will be actioned in 2020, not every fire will be fought. Environment and Natural Resources has reviewed the additional COVID-related measures for the 2020 season with the Chief Public Health Officer and the Departments of Municipal and Community Affairs and Health and Social Services, which are in support of the plan. Environment and Natural Resources will continue to work collaboratively throughout the season to ensure a coordinated effort. Mr. Speaker, it is so important, perhaps now more than ever, that each one of us does our part to prevent wildfire. This year, Environment and Natural Resources launched a new contest to encourage residents to FireSmart their properties while maintaining physical distance from others. I encourage Northwest Territories residents to take part. Clearing brush, raking leaves, even cutting your lawn, can help keep your home safe. Finally, I would just like to remind everyone to be careful on the land. Do not let your campfire become a wildfire. By reducing the number of fires in the Northwest Territories this summer, we can all help keep our fire crews and our communities stay safe and healthy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

System accreditation is an important and major milestone for our health and social services system. It signals that our system meets fundamental national standards of practice, policies and programs. Our commitment to high quality health care should reassure residents that they are receiving care and services to national standards. Accreditation is an intensive and ongoing process that assesses health and social services systems organizations against standards of excellence to identify what is being done well, and where they can improve. This process helps create better services for all, and it allows our organization to better understand how to use resources, increase efficiency, enhance quality and safety and reduce risk. Quote: “I am very pleased with our Health Authorities for receiving and maintaining their accreditation status. This milestone is a testament to the hard work our Health care professionals provide daily, should reassure residents that they are receiving care and services to national standards. -Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick Facts: ·       The NTHSSA received a 97% compliance rate, HRHSSA received 88% compliance rate and TCSA received 98% compliance rate with Accreditation Canada Standards.  ·       The 2019 Accreditation survey is the very first assessment completed of all health and social services in the Northwest Territories.   ·       More than 1,000 health and social service organizations and 7,000 sites in Canada and around the world have been accredited through Accreditation Canada. ·       Accreditation surveys and site visits were completed in late 2019.

Simpson: Education, Culture and Employment Response to COVID-19","Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 global pandemic has had profound effects on people around the world, including residents across the Northwest Territories (NWT). The Department of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) has been working tirelessly to adapt its programs and services to help lighten the economic, social and emotional weights of the pandemic, and I would like to provide an update to the public about those efforts.  We recognize the essential role that licensed early learning and child care programs have for our youngest residents and their families, and as a result ECE has continued to flow existing funding for licensed programs to daycares and day homes, regardless of whether they have chosen to close or remain open, since the start of the pandemic. In addition ECE helped coordinate with the NWT health authorities to match parents working within the healthcare system with childcare, as well as coordinating an online list of open licenced early learning and child care programs throughout the NWT. To provide further support during this challenging time we responded with an additional $5.1 million in temporary subsidies, including a 33 per cent subsidy for parents who are essential workers, an additional wage top-up of up to $1,000 a month for child care staff or family day home operators providing care during the pandemic.  Mr. Speaker, ECE continues to work closely with licensed early learning and child care programs and pass on regular information updates from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer, including best practices for early learning and child care, to ensure programs that are open remain operational and ones that have closed are able to reopen quickly.  In our Junior Kindergarten-Grade 12 education system, significant efforts have been made by educational staff, students, parents and guardians to accommodate the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. On March 24, 2020 based on my recommendation and initial recommendations from the CPHO, all elected NWT education leaders made the decision to keep schools closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year and to proceed with plans focused on a distance education approach for the continuity of learning for all Junior Kindergarten-Grade 12 students.   On March 30, 2020 we released the NWT Education Bulletin, which set the framework for continued learning. Since releasing the NWT Education Bulletin, ECE has provided additional support to teachers on all aspects of at-home learning, including providing distance supports for students with complex needs, course completion processes for high school students, and at-home Indigenous language learning, among others. ECE is providing guidance and support to Indigenous language instructors during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of our ongoing support for continued learning. Some language instructors have been collaborating with other subject teachers to incorporate language into their units, and many schools are using social media and school websites to promote and teach language and culture during school closures. Mr. Speaker, on May 12, 2020 the Emerging Wisely plan was released, which contained a recommendation for the reopening of schools. On May 13, 2020 NWT education leaders with my support decided that the challenges faced by schools due to the pandemic would make it impossible to reopen schools now and that the focus needed to be on planning for the upcoming 2020-2021 school year. The Department of ECE continues to work closely with education bodies and the NWT Teachers’ Association on continued learning for all NWT students for the 2019-2020 school year and on planning for the fall.  Mr. Speaker, for Grade 12 students who have worked so hard towards graduating and planning their next steps, Career and Education Advisors are reaching out to students by telephone, email and video conferencing to ensure they are aware of the support available to them.  These advisors will continue to offer their support to all interested Grade 12 students from now until September to support those dreams of where their adult lives would take them. I send my congratulations to all NWT high school graduates. You have worked hard and you made it. For post-secondary students accessing Student Financial Assistance, their funding continued for the remainder of their winter semester, and for those repaying loans, we deferred all payments to the end of September 2020, with no interest accrued during this time period. Student Case Officers also reached out to every single student receiving Student Financial Assistance to ensure they had information on how to return home safely, including contacts for travel agencies, information about self-isolation requirements, the self-isolation plan, and the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer. For students who will not have the opportunity to work to repay loans or save, the Student Financial Assistance program provided information on accessing income support and available federal benefits.   Mr. Speaker, to ensure the most vulnerable residents have enhanced supports for themselves and their families, the Income Assistance program made a number of temporary changes beginning in March. We provided a one-time emergency allowance for Income Assistance clients registered in March. Individuals received $500 and families received $1,000 in order to ensure they could purchase the necessary supplies to self-isolate for two weeks, if necessary, and to encourage physical distancing.  Monetary donations such as gifts from friends, family, benevolent organizations or Indigenous governments intended to provide support during the pandemic have been exempted from the calculation of Income Assistance benefits, through the end of June. We also made the decision to exempt the one-time Special GST credit for low and modest income residents, the one-time Special Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement payments for seniors, and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit for students. Administrative processes were streamlined to focus on quick responses and turnarounds for clients, including payrolling all clients through the end of June so that they do not have to report each month. The Productive Choice reporting requirement was also removed, and all clients were directed to engage in only one Productive Choice; taking care of themselves and their families. Finally, all clients were automatically assessed for both basic needs and enhanced benefits. Seniors receiving the Senior Home Heating Subsidy received a modest increase to their benefit beginning in April 2020, and automatically had their applications renewed for the 2020-2021 year to allow them to maintain physical distancing.  Mr. Speaker, Labour Development and Standards programs and services at the Department include Labour Market Programs; Apprenticeship, Trades and Occupation Certification; Employment Standards; and the NWT Nominee Program. These programs provide a range of financial supports to students, apprentices, employees, employers, communities and organizations. Clients have been advised that funding will continue as planned until the end of their programs, tuition refunds would be provided as required, training costs reimbursed, and funding for community and organization training and employment projects would continue.  In the areas of Culture and Heritage, Mr. Speaker, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre and NWT Archives closed to the public on March 16, 2020 due to the serious health concerns posed by COVID-19. Focus was placed on ensuring the public was aware of the museum’s extensive virtual exhibits and online resources. Staff worked hard to ensure delays in funding to NWT artists have been minimal and that accommodations are in place for arts projects impacted by the pandemic, and archaeological permitting and land reviews have continued with minor delays. Phase One of the Emerging Wisely plan recommends museums and art galleries reopen. While reduced hours and reduced public programming are expected the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is gearing up to open its doors to the public before the end of the month. The Francophone Affairs Secretariat worked quickly to streamline services available to our francophone population. Services TNO positioned itself as a hub for all non-health related information for our French speaking residents, and provided them with a single point of contact for all requests. The Secretariat also provided 24/7 translation services to ensure that our francophone residents had timely access to the vital information being shared by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer, the Department of Health and Social Services, and every other GNWT department involved in the COVID-19 response.  I want to thank the staff of ECE and the NWT Education Authorities for their incredible work in adapting to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The situation created by the pandemic has been unprecedented and so has the response from our staff. I want to personally thank them for all their efforts and hard work.  Mr. Speaker, everything we have responded with over the last few months has come about through an imperative to support Northerners, to make sure all Northerners had answers to their questions quickly, and critical programs were modified to meet their needs. As we move to adapt our programs further, the residents and communities of the territory are our primary concern and we commit to continuing to provide the supports and services residents need during this difficult time.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The Chief Public Health Officer is leading the public health response and providing subject matter expertise to the Health and Social Services system and Government of the Northwest Territories on pandemic planning requirements.  Our first step in responding to the threat of COVID-19 was to activate the Emergency Operations Center, or EOC, on March 11, 2020. The EOC assesses risks, identifies mitigation measures, and coordinates the Health and Social Services system response and recovery.  It includes representatives from the Department of Health and Social Services, the Health and Social Services Authorities, the Department of Finance and the NWT Emergency Measures Operations, led by the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs.  Mr. Speaker, this early coordination of our health and social services system response allowed for the necessary service adjustments to support the public health orders.  This included reducing non-essential health services in order to ramp up testing, contact tracing, and care for those who may test positive for COVID-19.  We also put in place measures to manage our Personal Protective Equipment inventory for front line health care workers and we are working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada to secure our supply. To safeguard residents living in long-term care facilities, guidelines were implemented to reduce visits, institute daily temperature checks and health screening.  Service providers also implemented protocols in relation to the use Personal Protective Equipment and enhanced disinfection practices well before we had any cases in the NWT. Mr. Speaker, in order to meet the requirements for physical distancing and provide timelier access to care, our health system has expanded virtual care.  This enables practitioners to meet with each other and with a patient over distance.  It also reduces physical patient interactions in waiting rooms, with clinic staff, and with providers through the use of phone visits and 	video-conferencing as well as providing remote access to the Electronic Medical Records.    We have also accelerated Primary Health Care Reform in Yellowknife in order to support the roll out of virtual care and to maintain continuity of services while physician resources are redeployed to other parts of the system. We have now moved to an Integrated Care Team model, which gives clients access to a dedicated primary care team rather than just a doctor.  We are also testing some outreach approaches to provide primary care services to individuals being served by shelter organizations in Yellowknife. Mr. Speaker, at the same time, the three Health and Social Services Authorities have been working diligently to address and prepare for the surge of transmission of the COVID-19 virus.  This coordinated approach across the NWT healthcare system is critical to ensure all resources are aligned in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients, staff and the residents of our territory at various stages of pandemic response.   This four-stage response plan is based on principles that acknowledge that the pandemic response is our government’s primary priority; that all response activities are coordinated and all resources must be managed system-wide.  It also focuses the response within the capabilities of our system:  maximizing and mobilizing staff where needed; moving patients to where care can be provided; redistributing supplies and equipment where and when needed and the appropriate triaging of care, including centralizing hospitalizations in Yellowknife and Edmonton for patients with severe symptoms.   This plan demonstrates a thorough and realistic approach to respond to COVID-19.  The Health and Social Services Pandemic Response Plan is being shared with Members of the Legislative Assembly and will be made public as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, the safety of children and youth in our care has been central to our COVID response.  We are taking every opportunity to improve the quality of our child and family services to positively impact outcomes for children and youth while working within the current public health measures.  During the containment phase of the pandemic, most face-to-face visits were temporarily suspended.  These temporary suspensions were in place to make sure children, families and frontline workers are safe.  Child and family services staff made use of virtual technology to keep children and their families connected with each other and with frontline workers.  With the release of the Emerging Wisely Plan, we are now assessing how to safely, gradually introduce face-to-face visits once again.  We are offering one-time, short-term financial support to help families meet their basic needs if they cannot get enough assistance from other programs and we have extended support services for youth in care and young adults who are aging out of these services during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also working with the Foster Family Coalition of the NWT to respond to the needs of foster caregivers and to provide ongoing support and communication.  We have established respite services for foster caregivers in the NWT to support them during the COVID-19 pandemic and have established clear protocols should a child in their care require testing or care for COVID-19. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our front line health and social services workers for their hard work and dedication to the people they serve.  I recognize that there are many challenges ahead and know that you will continue to serve our residents, as you always have, with professionalism, compassion and commitment. Our health and social services system has responded quickly and effectively to the COVID-19 challenge to date.  I am confident that we are well prepared to respond should there be a surge in COVID-19 transmissions into the future.    However, it remains critically important that we all remain vigilant in following the public health measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 and minimize the demand on our health and social services system.  We are stronger and healthier if we act together.     Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation’s 2020-2021 capital project delivery represents a total investment of over $43.8 million in the NWT.  Approximately 90% of this amount is targeted for housing projects outside of Yellowknife, with the focus being on our smaller communities. It will include the construction of 89 units and repair projects for 160 owned public, market and Homeownership Entry Level Program housing units located throughout the NWT. Highlights of our new construction include:  22 new and replacement units across the NWT including   		 6 market and public housing units in Behchokǫ̀ 2 market housing units in Hay River 4 market housing units in Tulita 6 public housing units in Délı̨nę 2 public housing units in Fort Smith 2 public housing units in Ulukhaktok   9 seniors units in Fort Good Hope,  8 single occupancy public housing units in Yellowknife,  4 New Home Program units in Fort Resolution, Tulı́t'a, Délı̨ne and Tuktoyaktuk,  45 market housing units for RCMP  		6 in Fort Smith 3 in Norman Wells 17 in Inuvik 7 in Fort Simpson, and  12 in Hay River.  This year’s unit repairs also include a major energy project in Yellowknife for the conversion of oil-fired furnaces to biomass heating.  We are undertaking this project with significant assistance from the federal government under the Low Carbon Economy Fund federal program.  The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation will be supplementing this $43.8 million with a further $3.6 million investment to deliver additional unit repairs by utilizing the internally funded $5 million COVID-19 reserve.  The aim of this additional investment is to bring on stream approximately 130 vacant housing units.   Approximately 60 of these units are available for allocation in the short-term.  Many of the remaining units will require some minor or major repair.  When repaired, these units will be allocated for use within the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation 's public housing, market and home ownership programs.   The introduction of these units, as well as the construction of new units, forms the basis of the housing response for any subsequent waves of the COVID-19 virus and is also a step towards fulfilling our mandate commitment to increase the number of affordable homes and reduce core housing need. While we expect that the vast majority of the planned capital investment will be delivered in this fiscal year, some projects such as those involving winter road and barge transportation, may require a two-year delivery.      The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation has a long history of supporting community businesses.  In 2018-2019, 94% of our contracting opportunities were awarded to local and northern businesses, and we expect similar results for this last year.  We have also worked closely with community leadership to obtain support to proceed with the majority of planned delivery for 2020-2021.  Mr. Speaker, housing will be a key element of the economic recovery of this Territory.  The construction, repair and other contract work around housing brings in much needed income to the NWT, and to our smaller communities.  This capital investment will support local and regional contractors, provide opportunities for apprentices and building trades-helpers, and ensures that a large portion of investment stays in the NWT.  I look forward to seeing these new projects and opportunities for our people become reality. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

239,2020-05-28,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-tourism-nwt-post-covid,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Tourism in the NWT Post-COVID,"Mr. Speaker, businesses across the Northwest Territories have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but perhaps none more so than our tourism sector. The tourism sector was one of the first hit by the pandemic and will likely be amongst the last to recover from its effects. Northwest Territories tourism is reliant on national and international travel however for the time being our borders must remain closed to protect the health of our residents and our small and remote communities.   We recognize that this is happening at a cost to business owners and entrepreneurs in the Northwest Territories.  For those whose livelihoods are built around attracting and welcoming visitors to our territory, the impacts have been significant.  As we mark National Tourism Week this year, we continue to work with the Government of Canada to identify a measure of relief for the Northwest Territory tourism industry that is reflective of the impact that is being felt and the significance of the tourism sector to our economy.   The advocacy of our territory’s tourism association on behalf of our tourism industry has been instrumental in helping us increase the overall awareness in Ottawa of the need for specific and regionally-appropriate support programs.   The federal government is listening. As a result of our work, CanNor’s Northern Business Relief Fund was introduced and significantly expanded relief options for Northwest Territories and Indigenous businesses. We were also able to secure additional support for the North’s airline industry, which a large portion of our tourism sector relies on.  We know that some of our tourism operators have accessed relief from this fund but we still have work to do. In the coming weeks, Premier Cochrane will be bringing the challenges faced by our tourism sector to the attention of the Prime Minister, asking for more funding under the Northern Business Relief Fund to address the specific needs of our operators and tourism businesses.   Meanwhile, as Northwest Territories businesses begin to resume operations across the territory, and we take steps to recover our economy, we have re-introduced our Support for Entrepreneurs and Economic Development Program, also known as SEED for the 2020-2021 fiscal year.  It represents $4 million dollars of investment into businesses in our communities.   Similarly, we will inject almost $4.4 million into parks infrastructure, tourism product development and community infrastructure projects this summer; supporting local suppliers, contractors and employees as we improve our tourism product for the future.   We will be waiving tourism insurance requirements and licensing fees for the 2020-21 season as another means of short term relief. Mr. Speaker, in the wake of COVID-19 the landscape of tourism in the Northwest Territories has changed.  We are already considering how our next tourism strategy can be adapted and its funding approach redefined to support the economic recovery of our tourism sector. To this end we are once again engaging with our tourism sector specifically to understand the level to which their businesses and operations have been changed.  As we do so, we can take some comfort in what hasn’t, and will not, change.  With its wild natural beauty, rich cultures, midnight sun, and Aurora Borealis, our North remains as attractive as ever before. Northerners will always be warm and welcoming; our industry vibrant and resilient; and our tourism product spectacular. It will take time, and it will take work, but we will recover.   Our borders will open and our North will once again take its place as one of the world’s most spectacular tourism destinations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

As we continue that discussion, we are also moving forward to other financial matters to be discussed during this sitting of the Legislative Assembly.  The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic do not change the Government’s need to continue providing programs and services.   At the same time, we have been responding to the immediate needs of the Northwest Territories economy, communities, businesses and residents as a result of the health restrictions.    Since the 2020-2021 Budget was introduced, the Government’s fiscal situation has worsened as the COVID-19 pandemic has created declines in own source revenues and increases in expenditures as the Government has developed and launched a variety of economic relief packages. The significance of the negative effects on the fiscal framework will be better known as the Emerging Wisely plan is further implemented.   Mr. Speaker, we are fortunate that Canada has provided $23 million in support to the GNWT response that will partially offset costs directly related to COVID-19. Right now, departments are responding to COVID-19 in ways that have not been included in their budgets through existing appropriations. These include the establishment of Emergency Management Operations, which are likely to be ongoing for some time; the roll-out of managed alcohol; check stops at borders; monitoring of incoming air traffic passengers; self-isolation centers in regional centers; and homelessness supports. The Department of Finance is working with all departments and public agencies to track all incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, the Government of the Northwest Territories has spent almost $7.9 million in COVID-related costs and we project an additional $31.1 million will be needed, of which $11.3 million is allocated to the health response.  The Government of the Northwest Territories has also provided targeted assistance to various sectors in the territory including funding for childcare providers, airport landing fee holidays, airport lease fee holidays, and increased income assistance which to date totals over $30 million.   I believe we must work to creatively use further assistance to advance the 19th Legislative Assembly’s Mandate. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting health measures being implemented across the planet have thrown the global economy into the economic equivalent of a 100-year storm.  Given the economic disruption, and despite all immediate government actions to support the economy, things will not be the same when the COVID-19 pandemic health measures have lifted. The Government of the Northwest Territories has a responsibility to support the recovery as quickly as possible or much of the private sector may not have the ability to recover. We need to act quickly and strategically to invest in the future economy and in our residents and businesses in a way that reflects the core values held by Northwest Territories residents and builds on the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly. It is my expectation that through the structure of the Emerge Stronger dialogue and process, we will be able to gather ideas and proposals that reflect needs from across regions, communities and sectors in order to take responsive and responsible funding decisions.  Mr. Speaker, departments have provided high level assessments of COVID-19 impacts on the Mandate priorities and associated actions that indicate a lot of the Mandate items can be fulfilled by the end of the 19th Legislative Assembly with few delays or issues.  As we adjust to a post-COVID environment, I look forward to working with all Members to keep the Mandate largely aligned with the economic and social recovery by recognizing priorities that may no longer be relevant and embracing new priorities that may have emerged.   As part of the 2020-2021 budgeting process, a fiscal strategy has been presented that spans the life of the 19th Legislative Assembly. Part of this strategy identified $25 million to fund Mandate priorities over the next four years.  This funding is proposed to remain in place and the Supplementary Appropriation to be considered this sitting will include an advancement of immediate funding to begin work on several initiatives.   Mr. Speaker, back in February, I indicated that we would hold public discussions on the next budget as soon as possible so that the Assembly would have the benefit of residents’ priorities in advance of finalizing the four-year business plans. These plans and increased program evaluation, among several policy initiatives, are intended to lead to governing so that “the Northwest Territories is a premier destination to live with a positive economic future, strong educational opportunities for our children, quality health care, a respectful approach to honouring lands, water and wildlife, and collaborative relationships with Indigenous governments based in a commitment to reconciliation.” We want to understand how residents interpret what is essentially our mission statement.  The COVID-19 pandemic has not changed this commitment. Over the summer months of 2020, supported by the Department of Finance, I will endeavour to meaningfully engage with residents of the Northwest Territories to determine their views on a variety of topics related to how and why the Government of the Northwest Territories spends money. Of particular interest to me, given the drastic changes that have taken place as a result of COVID-19, is how residents and stakeholders think the Government should change the way we do business and what measured risks they would support the Government to take to aid with the economic and social recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Both extensions will take effect as of May 27, 2020 and expire on June 9, 2020. Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Kami Kandola.  Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. We are now just over a week into eased restrictions as described within Phase One of the Emerging Wisely plan. These include opportunities like increased interpersonal interactions, the opening of some business and organizations, and increased numbers for outdoor gatherings. It is important to remember that most travel into the NWT by non-residents is prohibited with limited exceptions. NWT residents entering the NWT are still required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith before travelling to their home community.  In order to ensure we can maintain ongoing support of the Public Heath orders, including checkpoints and isolation centres, as well as the ability to respond to any potential new cases and the impacts that might arise, it is necessary to continue to maintain a Public Health Emergency and State of Emergency.  While the Northwest Territories is currently in containment mode, with no evidence of community spread and all cases recovered, the situation can change quickly without carefully managing the continued response.    Nationwide spread is the biggest risk of expanding spread within the Northwest Territories and Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably across Canada.  These extensions reflect the need to remain vigilant and swiftly respond to any changes to the current situation in the Northwest Territories. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continues to enhance our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an ongoing effort to protect the health of the residents of the Northwest Territories.

245,2020-05-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-covid-19-public-health-response,Government Website,Diane Thom: COVID-19 Public Health Response,"Check Against Delivery    Mr. Speaker, in the past few months, we have asked people to change the way we live, work and socialize in order to protect our territory against COVID-19.  This is by far.  the most significant public health crisis we have faced in decades.   Today, I would like to reflect on the public health measures we have put in place and how we will continue to protect our territory, while bringing some stability back to our lives.  Mr. Speaker, our response to COVID-19 began well before the Public Health Emergency was called.  In early March, the Department of Health and Social Services and the Chief Public Health Officer activated the Emergency Operations Centre.  This allowed for rapid COVID-19 system planning and preparation.  We had also began enhanced testing of residents and visitors for COVID-19 who presented flu-like symptoms and had travelled outside of the Northwest Territories well before the pandemic was declared.  This allowed us to take quick action if a positive case was confirmed and ensure our testing capability was in place across the NWT. The Chief Public Health Officer also issued guidance to all Long Term Care facilities to protect our elders against the spread of the virus.  Additionally, our health care system initiated enhanced infection control practices in all health care facilities to protect front-line health care workers.   Our public outreach was also increased to provide residents with truthful, evidence-based information on the virus, and how to keep each other safe.  Mr. Speaker, as the situation in Southern Canada began to escalate it was apparent that stronger action was required.  I declared a Public Health Emergency on 	March 18 on the recommendation of the Chief Public Health Officer.  This allowed the Chief Public Health Officer to issue the necessary public health orders to protect our territory.  These Orders prohibited non-resident travel within the territory, mandated two weeks of self-isolation for residents returning from anywhere outside our boundaries, and that Self-Isolation Plans be submitted in order to ensure compliance.  Mr. Speaker, as we began to get positive cases we made the difficult decision to close businesses where physical distancing could not be maintained.  At the same time, we provided the necessary advice for essential businesses and employers to stay open safely.  We also acted to limit the risks from essential workers entering into the NWT to play crucial roles in our society and our economy by getting measures in-place to track them, monitor their health, and have them self-isolate whenever possible.   Mr. Speaker, a significant amount of work went on behind the scenes to build the necessary systems to fully implement the public health measures.  Within hours of restricting travel, our government instituted a public call centre, staffed check stops on our highways and airports, set up self-isolation hubs and implemented a self-isolation planning and assessment process.  The Chief Public Health Officer has also established a Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce trained to respond to public health risks in our communities.  This team is working across the NWT and has visited more than half of our communities to provide outreach events to educate residents about the public health measures as well as enforce.  Mr. Speaker, the results from our initial response has allowed us to contain the spread of COVID-19.  We currently have no active cases and no community spread. That is a testament to the effectiveness of the orders in keeping us safe.  And it is a credit to everyone in this territory who followed the orders and advice to contain this virus.  Mr. Speaker, while implementing timely and aggressive public health measures was necessary to contain the spread, the need to gradually and wisely ease our restrictions was always part of the overall plan.  We were just waiting until it was safe to do so.  Two weeks ago, the Chief Public Health Officer released Emerging Wisely, our path to emerging gradually, safely, and wisely from our strictest public health measures, and bringing some stability back to the territory.  It reflects the caution and care our residents expect in order to continue to protect our remote communities, and our healthcare system.  Through the four phases of easing, restrictions are gradually lifted to allow for residents to visit their friends, family, and neighbours; do more activities; and 	re-open more businesses – and doing it all safely. But we also made it clear that this is not a return to business-as-usual – and it will not be until this pandemic has run its course.  We are calling on residents to accept that some measures will be in place for a long time.  Travel into the territory will remain restricted, and self-isolation requirements will remain in place for residents who chose to travel outside of the NWT and for those entering on an essential or exceptional basis.  And until there is a vaccine, we must keep physical distance of two metres and continue to wash our hands more than we ever have; wear non-medical masks in crowded spaces; and keep our most vulnerable safe.  That is what will keep this territory strong and healthy. Mr. Speaker, all Northwest Territories residents have a role to play.  We must remain mindful and use caution as our restrictions are lifted, because this pandemic will continue – and so will our response.  Lifting restrictions comes with some risks.  It is likely that we will get more cases and we may experience community spread.  And to rise to the challenge, we may need to call on everyone to make sacrifices again.  But with these months behind us, I am confident that Northerners have the strength and resiliency to do what is necessary to protect themselves, their family and friends and communities to remain healthy.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
246,2020-05-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-may-june-2020-sessional-statement,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: May-June 2020 Sessional Statement,"Check Against Delivery    Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome all Members back to the continuation of our Second Sitting of the 19th Legislative Assembly.  Much has changed, in the Northwest Territories and around the world, since our sitting was interrupted by the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic this past March.  Governments across Canada, including our own, have had to take swift and strong action to protect the health and safety of Canadians from this disease.  COVID-19 is a disease that no one in the world has natural immunity to. There is no vaccine, and there is no effective anti-viral treatment for it. The best way to prevent its spread is to ensure people are not exposed to the virus.  Physical distancing was – and still is – the best protection against COVID-19, and that is why governments across Canada moved quickly in mid-March to close businesses, restrict travel and put limits on gatherings of people.  Mr. Speaker, while these strict limits were absolutely necessary for protecting everybody’s health, they were devastating for the national and territorial economy.  The situation has left our government, like all governments in this country, grappling with two challenges at the same time: a public health crisis and a socio- economic crisis.  On the public health side, we have relied heavily on the work of the Northwest Territories’ Chief Public Health Officer, as well as the Department of Health and Social Services and the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority.  Along with public health officials across Canada, the Chief Public Health Officer was monitoring the progression of COVID-19 in other countries and taking steps to make sure the Northwest Territories was ready for it even before the global pandemic was declared on March 11.  The day before the pandemic was declared, the Chief Public Health Officer issued an update on COVID-19, and gave extensive advice to Northwest Territories residents on how to keep themselves safe. Recommendations included avoiding non-essential travel outside of the territory, self-monitoring for people who had recently travelled, reconsidering plans for public gatherings, and keeping a two-week supply of food and medicine at home.  As COVID-19 began to spread in southern Canada, the Minister of Health and Social Services on the recommendation of the Chief Public Health Officer declared a public health emergency in the Northwest Territories on March 18, 2020. The following day, the Government of the Northwest Territories took the unprecedented step of directing its employees to begin working from home, in an effort to help encourage physical distancing and slow the spread of COVID-19. Two days later, on March 21st, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Northwest Territories and a public health order prohibiting travel into the territory was put into place, except for residents returning home and workers providing essential services. All people entering the NWT from outside were also required to self-isolate for 14 days in one of four regional communities where appropriate medical care was available in case they developed COVID-19.  On March 22nd, the Chief Public Health Officer recommended that all mass gatherings be cancelled immediately, and that certain businesses where it would be impossible to maintain physical distancing be closed. These recommendations were made into binding public health orders on April 10, 2020.  To assist with the implementation of the Chief Public Health Officer’s orders, the Government of the Northwest Territories set up regional self-isolation centres for people returning from outside the territory, and established a compliance and enforcement taskforce, drawing on staff from across the Government of the Northwest Territories with enforcement experience.  To better coordinate the whole of government response, the Municipal and Community Affairs Emergency Management Organization was fully activated and a territorial state of emergency was declared on March 24th.  While all these measures were necessary to protect residents and communities from the spread of COVID-19, our government recognizes that these decisions also had serious economic consequences for people, businesses and communities.  We also recognized that we had an obligation to not just protect public health, but to help the territory weather the financial and economic storm that COVID-19 has caused. This would require a whole-of government effort, with all departments involved in the response.  On March 20, just days into the crisis, the Ministers of Finance and of Industry, Tourism and Investment announced on behalf of our government the first set of measures designed to help reduce the impacts of the COVID-19 shutdown on the NWT and its residents.  Valued at $13.2 million dollars, this first economic package included measures like providing low-interest loans through the Business Development and Investment Corporation to help businesses offset the impacts of COVID-19.  The Government of the Northwest Territories also agreed to advance resource revenues to Indigenous governments that are signatories to the devolution agreement and to allow Indigenous governments, non-government organizations and community governments to carry over unused contribution amounts into the current fiscal year.  Increased funding was also made available through Education, Culture and Employment for income assistance clients and seniors to help address the impacts of COVID-19.  In addition to new funding, the Government of the Northwest Territories also decided to suspend or defer the collection of fees and revenues owing to it. This was another way to relieve the financial burden being experienced by people, businesses and communities as a result of COVID-19.  These measures included removing transportation fees by the Department of Infrastructure, deferring Business Development and Investment Corporation and student financial assistance loan payments, pausing most collection efforts, and extending the due date for Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission employer fees. The Northwest Territories Power Corporation contributed to these relief efforts by removing load limiters and ceasing disconnections, as well as pausing its collection efforts.  A second economic relief package valued at almost $8.3 million was announced on March 31st, including additional supports for income assistance clients and further fee reductions.  This package also identified $5 million for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation to create temporary housing for homeless persons, including housing in Yellowknife and 130 units in communities outside the capital.  Further announcements saw Education, Culture and Employment allocate $5 million dollars to support child care for essential workers and decide to exempt federal emergency benefits from income assistance eligibility calculations. The Department of Finance also introduced a wage top-up plan for workers earning less than $18 dollars an hour. The Department of Justice also instituted a moratorium on residential evictions, allowed for rent deferrals for residential tenants affected by the pandemic, while the Housing Corporation enhanced the Territorial Rent Supplement Program.  Leaseholders on public lands are also seeing relief in the form of a $2.7 million dollar decision to waive rent on existing leases for the 2020-2021 fiscal year from the Department of Lands.  Support to businesses has been a joint effort of our government and the Government of Canada, with Government of the Northwest Territories efforts being designed to complement immediate relief available to Northwest Territories businesses from the federal government. In addition to working capital loans provided by the Business Development and Investment Corporation, $4 million dollars is available to territorial businesses through Industry, Tourism and Investment’s SEED Program, to help businesses recover as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.  In the first of two planned announcements, the Government of the Northwest Territories in partnership with the Government of Canada is helping four northern passenger-based airlines access $8.7 million in funding. Further funding announcements with Canada are expected for additional airlines.  Of course, the Northwest Territories is not alone in facing this pandemic, and all Members of Cabinet have been working closely with their federal, provincial and territorial counterparts to help coordinate efforts and advocate for the Northwest Territories.  All Ministers are working hard to ensure that Northwest Territories needs are clearly understood so federal assistance programs benefit our residents and businesses. We are also coordinating on key issues like securing the national supply chain so the territory continues to have access to essential goods, and participating in national bulk orders for personal protective equipment.  While the threat of COVID-19 is not over, our government also recognizes that a complete shutdown of the Northwest Territories economy and society is not sustainable or affordable. Although our priority in the past two months has been on managing the immediate threat to public health, we have also been working on plans for recovery and for emerging wisely.  Mr. Speaker, I am sure all Members felt the same relief I did when the Chief Public Health Officer unveiled her phased plan for carefully relaxing the public health restrictions that have kept Northwest Territories residents safe during the first stages of the pandemic.  To be clear, emerging from those restrictions means taking on greater risk that there could be new COVID-19 infections, but the gradual relaxation outlined in Emerging Wisely will help us manage that risk together.  With a plan in place for managing the public health risk, the Government of the Northwest Territories is now focusing on emerging stronger with a plan for broader social and economic recovery.  This will not be a plan the government develops in isolation; the pandemic hit all sectors of the Northwest Territories and all sectors will need to be involved in designing the recovery. As outlined to Members previously, we will be working closely with Members of the Legislative Assembly to design a plan, advised by committees representing business and industry, Indigenous governments, community governments, and community organizations.  COVID-19 presents a shared challenge like none this government has faced before, Mr. Speaker. No previous territorial government has had to respond to a global health threat so quickly and with so little time to prepare.  I am proud of the work the Government of the Northwest Territories has done to design solutions on the fly, protect public health, manage and mitigate the social and economic impacts on individuals, businesses and communities, and keep essential services running safely.  I want to thank all the staff who worked tirelessly to help support the government’s response to COVID-19, especially our front-line staff in the health care system, staff managing the self-isolation centres and the compliance and enforcement staff protecting our borders and making sure people are following public health orders.  I also want to thank and recognize all the essential workers who have continued to come into work throughout this pandemic – like the truckers, grocery store and pharmacy workers, child care workers law enforcement, and airline employees – who have continued to keep the Northwest Territories moving.  While the entire territory has risen to the challenge of COVID-19, there are more challenges to come. We are a strong and resilient territory, and I am confident that we can successfully manage our way through this pandemic and emerge even stronger, by working together with the same kind of spirit and determination that Northwest Territories residents displayed over the past two months.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

The reintroduction of approximately 130 units will help to reduce overcrowding and assist smaller communities to address homelessness by lowering public housing wait lists. Easing overcrowding will also help us as a territory for any potential second wave of COVID-19.    In terms of sales of NWTHC units for homeownership, priority will be given to applicants who are currently public housing tenants. Doing this will free up public housing units and reduce the number of clients currently sitting on wait lists. As in incentive to attract homeownership clients, a $20,000 improvement allowance will be included.    Quote: “As we work to address housing demand in our small communities, freeing up these approximately 130 units will be very beneficial to supporting residents who are at risk of or currently experiencing homelessness. The allocation of these units will allow us to transition our higher income earners currently in public housing to homeownership, reducing overcrowding, freeing up spaces on the public housing wait lists and providing stable housing for those residents who are at risk.” -Paulie Chinna, Minister Responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation and Minister Responsible for Homelessness     Quick Facts:    Approximately 60 units are available for allocation in the short-term.  Many of the remaining units will require some minor or major repair No new operations and maintenance expenditures will be required for these units. The total number of Public Housing units after the additional units are introduced will still not exceed the budgeted allocation of 2,423 units.   Related links Northwest Territories Housing Corporation – Programs and Services GNWT’s Response to COVID-19   For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

Simpson, the NWT Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) and NWT Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) Dr. Kami Kandola on May 19, 2020 to discuss planning for the coming 2020-2021 school year. Last week, Dr. Kandola released Emerging Wisely, the plan to ease public health restrictions in the NWT during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of Phase 1 of the plan, the CPHO recommended schools could be reopened for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year, provided they are able to follow new health and safety measures.  While education bodies agreed to keep schools closed for the remainder of the year due to operational challenges with reopening, there was strong agreement that the detailed requirements provided by the CPHO provide schools with the necessary guidance to inform ongoing risk assessment and planning for reopening classrooms in the fall, should the COVID-19 situation remain similar. Education leaders and the NWTTA were able to hear from Dr. Kandola on the Emerging Wisely plan and current public health information on COVID-19, and ask questions as it relates to planning for the 2020-21 school year to ensure the safety of staff and students.  The discussion focused on current knowledge about COVID-19 infections among children and youth, balancing the social and health impacts of school closures with safety requirements, and the various public health measures to be put in place at schools, including physical distancing requirements, use of personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning and disinfection, and other types of administrative controls to minimize risk. Questions from education leaders focused on how schools should put health and safety guidance into practice under the new requirements; for example, how to comply with class size limitations in large schools with lots of students, and how to ensure physical distancing in smaller schools with multiple age groups sharing limited space.  Recognizing the varied circumstances of schools across the NWT and their unique challenges, Dr. Kandola emphasized there would not be a one-size-fits-all approach for reopening classrooms. Education bodies will have the flexibility to determine what works best for them based on their capacity, and the Office of the CPHO will be able to provide direction and assistance on risk mitigation as part of their review of each school’s plan for reopening. Education bodies will continue to coordinate with ECE and the NWTTA on planning for the upcoming 2020-21 school year based on the most up-to-date recommendations from the CPHO. The next meeting of NWT Education Leaders and Minister Simpson will take place Wednesday, June 3, 2020. Quotes: “The guidance provided by Dr. Kandola in Emerging Wisely provides important direction for how we can safely reopen schools in the fall. I’m grateful for her expertise and openness in working with our Education Leaders to convey the latest public health information and recommendations, and to assist as we balance the need to support our students with the need to protect all residents of the NWT.” 	-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment ""The Education Leaders thank Dr. Kandola for providing more clarity around the Emerging Wisely document and its implications for the health and safety of students, staff, parents and visitors. It was acknowledged that we have very different circumstances, be they in the regional centres or in our remote communities, and that each school and district will have to plan for the reentry of students in the way that best aligns to their reality. We also know that we have the support of ECE, the NWTTA and the CPHO moving forward. This support will be crucial in the weeks and months to come. We remain optimistic and we will continue to inform our stakeholders as plans are developed."" 	 -Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

As part of the GNWT’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and recognizing that acquiring personal protective equipment (PPE) would be challenging for governments and organizations in the NWT due to increased global demand, the GNWT is working to procure PPE and distribute bulk orders throughout the territory. The orders in question were part of this effort to support communities, Indigenous governments and non-government organizations.  The recalled KN95 masks in the orders are made by several overseas manufacturers. They have been recalled by Health Canada because they do not meet the 95 per cent filtration specifications for medical respirators in Canada. The recall was issued on May 11, 2020. Procuring PPE at this time has proven very challenging for the GNWT, as this equipment is in great demand across the country and globally. The KN95 masks were ordered before the Health Canada recall was issued. The GNWT is contacting the community governments and organizations who received these shipments of KN95 masks and informing them they cannot be used for medical or industrial purposes.  The health and safety of NWT residents is the main priority of the GNWT. That is why it has invested resources into procuring and distributing PPE throughout the territory during these challenging times. It will take steps to address the situation and make any necessary adjustments to ensure it is sourcing PPE that meet Health Canada standards in the future.    Quote “The GNWT takes this matter very seriously and we are doing all we can to inform communities and organizations about the KN95 mask recall and to ensure we have the processes in place to prevent a similar situation from happening again.  We are already actively working to replenish this order as we assist communities and residents to find the PPE supplies that will protect them from the COVID-19 virus and keep them safe.” -Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories     Quick Facts ·       PPE is a vital control measure that, used appropriately with other controls, can prevent transmission of infectious disease and save lives.  ·       PPE includes face masks, eye protection, gowns, and gloves. KN95 masks are designed to filter out at least 95 per cent of airborne particles and are most necessary in health care settings and may also be used in some industrial applications. ·       PPE is not a substitute for physical distancing or engineered and administrative controls intended to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.    Media contact  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories PressSecretary@gov.nt.ca "

260,2020-05-15,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/phase-one-eased-public-health-measures-begins,Government Website,Phase One of Eased Public Health Measures Begins,"Today, the Northwest Territories (NWT) takes its first careful steps towards a more open society.  As announced on May 12th, the territory needed to complete several essential steps to move into relaxing phase one of eased measures outlined in the Emerging Wisely Plan shared with residents by the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) earlier this week.  Today, the territory completed the final essential step by having no community spread for 28 days since the last negative test was collected for the final recovered case. With no community spread, the territory is now implementing an order to ease up on the public health restrictions across the NWT. The order is effective immediately.  NWT residents can expect to enjoy more interpersonal contact, outdoor gatherings of up to 25 people, as long as physical distance is maintained, and some businesses and organizations can open with new rules. Other phase one activities include outdoor sports clubs and organizations opening with restrictions, and some recreation facilities – including outdoor kitchen shelters and day-use areas in parks opening.  Orders on travel restrictions, essential workers, remote camp-workers, physical distancing of two metres, and the requirement not to participate in activities if you are sick will remain in-place for the foreseeable future.     Quotes:  “The health and safety of NWT residents is our main priority as the Government of the Northwest Territories. We aren’t out of the woods yet, and as we head into the long weekend, I urge all residents to remember  that we need to work together to keep COVID-19 out of the NWT.  Pleases follow the measures in place and abide by the Chief Public Health Officer’s recommendations as we enjoy this first long weekend with a more open society.” -Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories   “Implementing phase one of our Emerging Wisely plan is exciting news and I hope residents across the territory enjoy time with friends and family this weekend that you maybe haven’t been able to see in some time. That being said, I want to remind folks that our Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce will continue to investigate and respond to reports throughout the weekend to ensure compliance with these new orders are maintained. Now, more than ever, we need to work together to keep each other safe.”  -Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick facts:  Here’s how indoor visitation works:   		Each household can have up to five people they don’t live with come over and be inside their house, to a maximum of 10 people in total inside the house at any time. This is required.  				It's strongly recommended that in your household, you keep a circle of friends as small as possible. Here are a few good ways to do it. Keep to your fave five: Stick with the same five people to invite over to your place. Remember – you could still hang out with others at a park or in your backyard as long as you keep two metres apart. Your fave five would just be for inside your house where the risk is highest.  Have each person in the house pick one person they will have over regularly: this is a great way to make sure your best friends can come over for a coffee, while your household’s circle stays small. Pick another house with your best friends or a family you get along with and have them over regularly: this is another way to keep your circle small.   It’s also strongly recommended that you keep physical distance of two metres in your house as much as you can to protect each other.  If you’re having someone over who’s older, has a weaker immune system, or has an illness already, we strongly recommend your house doesn’t have anyone else over while they are.  Our message to NWT resident: use your common sense to protect each other while we all get some relief from being cooped up.  Certain other indoor gatherings will be allowed to a limit of 10 persons or less – with strict physical distancing measures in-place. Outdoor gatherings will be limited to 25 persons or less – with strict physical distancing measures in-place.  Some organizations will be able to open up – including personal service establishments, massage therapy clinics, chiropractors, museums and art galleries, and others, so long as they put in place the required public health mitigation measures. Outdoor sports, with the exception of rugby, will be able to occur as long as the outdoor gathering limit is maintained Outdoor kitchen shelters and day use areas at parks can be opened. Overnight camping is not permitted at private or publicly-owned campgrounds until phase two. Specific types of mass gatherings will be allowed with capacity and other restrictions in place. For example: farmer’s markets, some recreational facilities, libraries, golf courses, beaches, boat launches, and playgrounds.

Simpson and the NWT Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) on May 13, 2020 to discuss the recent recommendation that NWT schools are safe to reopen for the remainder of the school year as part of Phase 1 of Emerging Wisely: Path to Eased Public Health Restrictions. All leaders agree that the recommendation from the NWT Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) that schools can be reopened is encouraging news as it relates to the COVID-19 situation, and that the detailed risk assessment planning process provided by the CPHO gives schools the essential guidance needed to move forward with reopening classrooms for students and staff. As circumstances vary greatly across communities and regions in terms of capacity to reopen schools at this time, Education Leaders have agreed to take a coordinated, territory-wide approach to determining if schools will reopen for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. Due to the many complex operational challenges faced by schools at this time, Education Leaders have decided not to reopen schools for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. These challenges include, but are not limited to, the absence of teachers in many communities, strong concerns from local governments, and an immediate shortage of the equipment required to maintain safety under the CPHO’s recommendations. Most schools anticipate being unable to complete and implement the rigorous risk management plans needed to reopen prior to the end of the school year. With the ECE Minister’s support, Education Leaders have agreed to use the new recommendations of the CPHO to inform ongoing planning for the 2020-21 school year to ensure strong health and safety practices are put in place for staff, students and their families. Both the Minister and Education Leaders recognize the efforts that educational staff, students, parents and guardians have made to accommodate the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation over the past weeks. Many difficult decisions have had to be made in the interest of public safety in a short amount of time, and the education system will continue to adapt to public health information as it becomes available, while taking into consideration the unique circumstances of schools and communities across the territory. ECE continues to provide guidance and resources to schools to help them support students and families with at-home learning for the remainder of the year, and ECE, Education Bodies and the NWTTA will continue to work together on planning for the coming 2020-21 school year based on the most up-to-date recommendations from the CPHO.   Quotes: “I am encouraged by the recent recommendations of the NWT Chief Public Health Officer regarding the safe operation of schools during the time of COVID-19. I understand the many challenges faced by our Education Bodies across the territory, and support their unified decision to focus efforts on planning for the fall while supporting continued learning for all NWT students for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.” 					- R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “The phased-in approach to lifting restrictions as described in Emerging Wisely is indeed welcome news. As school boards, we have heard the recommendation that schools can reopen. Together, we have analyzed our capacity to do so and have determined that for the safety of our staff and students, we will not. Taking the necessary time to plan for a well-thought-out re-entry in the fall is our priority. That being said, we will continue to support our students via our continuity of learning plans until the end of June.” 					 -Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   For all COVID-19 media inquiries, contact: Cabinet Communications  PressSecretary@gov.nt.ca"

Both extensions will take effect as of May 13, 2020 and expire on May 26, 2020. These extensions are due to the continued need for response to the COVID-19 global pandemic to protect public health in the Northwest Territories and do not indicate a significant change in circumstances or an increased risk to the people of the NWT. Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Kami Kandola.  Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. This extension of the Public Health Emergency allows the Chief Public Health Officer to continue to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic. Extending the State of Emergency ensures the Emergency Management Organization (EMO) continues to be in a position to support the orders issued by the Chief Public Health Officer. While the Northwest Territories is currently in containment mode, with no evidence of community spread and all cases recovered, we continue to see new cases in the rest of Canada.  With community spread continuing at high levels across Canada, the risk presented remains high to the Northwest Territories. The NWT relies in part on out-of-territory workers to maintain essential services and deliver on critical projects.  The need to maintain border controls to limit the exposure to COVID-19 continues to be a priority. Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably across Canada.  With the current Public Health Emergency in place, the Chief Public Health Officer has been able to safeguard our territory and to develop forward looking plans that are only possible with the Public Health Emergency and the State of Emergency in place.  These extensions reflect the need to remain vigilant and swiftly respond to any changes to the current situation in the Northwest Territories. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continues to enhance our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an ongoing effort to protect the health of the residents of the Northwest Territories. All residents are reminded to follow the orders and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer during this challenging time.   For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

Under this program, businesses are asked to apply for temporary funding to increase the wages of their employees who make less than $18 per hour, for a maximum of 16 weeks between April 1 and July 31, 2020. The program is available to all workers in the NWT that are currently earning less than $18 per hour and are over 15 years old. The federal government has contributed $4.74 million for the NWT Wage Top-up Program, which is intended to assist all lower-wage workers working to keep the economy running while physical distancing measures are in place. Businesses can start applying immediately for funding to top up employees’ wages from April to $18/hour. While the intent of the program is to help employees, we are asking businesses to partner with us to deliver the program, as the funding will flow through the employer. With that in mind, employees are encouraged to make sure that their employer is aware of the program and notify them if not. Quotes: “The NWT Wage Top-up Program provides a thank you in the form of a financial boost to our lower paid workers who are continuing to help sustain the NWT economy while the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic continues. I call on all NWT businesses with employees to participate, and thank them in advance for helping to make this program successful.  All residents and families are struggling in some way during this pandemic. My hope is that these measures will offer some relief, and a well-deserved ‘thank-you’, to those among us who need and deserve it most.   We will continue to monitor the economic impact of COVID-19 and introduce further supports for NWT residents and businesses to help support and re-build the NWT economy.” -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance   ” There are many lower-wage workers who must still work outside the home during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide essential services that our residents and communities rely on. The NWT Wage-top up program is a way to give back to those workers who have continued to provide essential services to our residents. I want to thank each of you for helping us get through these unprecedented and challenging times.” 					-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment  Quick facts: ·       The wage top-up is a taxable benefit for employees. ·       Businesses will receive a one-time payment from the GNWT to cover the administrative costs of adjusting their employees’ wages and the employer CPP and EI contributions for the top-up portion of the employee’s wages. ·       Businesses will be asked to complete an application, providing eligible employee hours and wages. Once applications are approved, the GNWT will issue monthly payments to employers to cover the cost of the top-up, for a maximum of 16 weeks.

The plan, titled Emerging Wisely, outlines where we are today, how we got here, and a five-part approach for gradually moving the territory from the containment measures in-place today through four phases of eased measures. The path includes progressively-eased restrictions on people, businesses, and activities important to residents.  Beginning as soon as circumstances allow and rolling out over the next 12-18 months, the phases are as follows:  ·       Current state: Containment  ·       Relaxing Phase 1: First steps  ·       Relaxing Phase 2: Next steps  ·       Relaxing Phase 3: Careful steps past the second wave ·       Final Measures Lifted Included are descriptions of what requirements must be met to begin moving into each phase, what kinds of activities will be considered within each phase, and timeframes in which they can be expected (where they can be predicted).  Notably, the plan introduces a new model for indoor visitation – the Friendship Circle – whose implementation will begin in phase one.  The plan also highlights the measures which will need to be in place until a vaccine or effective treatment is widely available to NWT residents. There are also scenarios described which could cause the territory to move back to stricter measures. While everything will be done to avoid returning to aggressive containment measures, three criteria for considering a return to containment measures are also identified:  ·       Travel prohibition and restriction failures ·       Loss of contact tracing abilities  ·       Health system breakdown   Quotes  “Responding to the threat of COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories required strong measures and swift action. Because of the actions we took, the NWT is now in a position to start gradually relaxing the restrictions on our people and communities, including allowing bigger indoor and outdoor gatherings, and allowing some businesses to re-open. The measured approach outlined by Dr. Kandola will help us get the NWT and its economy moving again, while continuing to protect the health of NWT residents.” -Caroline Cochrane, Premier   “Residents and businesses have made huge sacrifices to protect each other in this unprecedented time. And together, we did something amazing: we all got on the same team to change our lifestyles, and we contained this virus for now. And that means that together, we can now start gradually, and safely re-introducing the things we love most into our daily routines. So, as we move forward, focus on your wellbeing because we’re in this fight for the long-haul – and we need to be in it together.”  -Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services    Quick facts  ·       Some measures are going to have to stay in place until the pandemic is over, including:  o   Travel restrictions at the border;  o   Self-isolation for returning travelers; and  o   Robust testing.  ·       There may be a need to re-impose restrictions when COVID-19 risk levels increase. These restrictions may not need to be the same for all communities and regions. Where community spread remains limited, regional or community-specific restrictions will be considered so areas considered to be at lower-risk may maintain their freedoms while outbreaks are controlled.  ·       Here’s how indoor visitation will work, beginning in phase one:  o   Each household can have up to five people they don’t live with come over and be inside their house. A maximum of 10 people in total can be inside the house at any time. This is required.  o   It's strongly recommended that in your household, you keep a circle of friends as small as possible. It’s also strongly recommended that you keep physical distance of two metres in your house as much as you can to protect each other.  o   If you’re having someone over who’s older, has a weaker immune system, or has an illness already, we strongly recommend your house doesn’t have anyone else over while they are.  o   Our message to NWT resident: use your common sense to protect each other while we all get some relief from being cooped up. ·       The phases and eased measures identified in the plan were developed through an exhaustive risk assessment completed by the Department of Health and Social Services – based on balancing personal freedoms with the need to manage the public health crisis through 2-3 waves throughout Canada and the United States.  ·       The public health risk assessment in the appendix provides useful information for organizations to understand what steps they must take to get ready to re-open.  ·       The Worker’s Safety and Compensation Commission has guidance and advice to be provided to those looking for information on how to implement these requirements in their workplaces. They are available to answer questions about workplaces.  ·       Additional questions on complying with the requirements of these phases should be sent to protectnwt@gov.nt.ca.    Relevant links ·       Emerging Wisely: Continued Public Health Response to COVID-19 in the NWT ·       Worker’s Safety and Compensation Commission COVID-19 information for employers – including workplace risk assessments     For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications Government of the Northwest Territories  Presssecretary@gov.nt.ca  "

The Department of ITI has developed a program guideline for 2020-21 focused on keeping investment within our communities and supporting local employment. It will work to prioritize applications from NWT businesses whose proposals focus on economic recovery.  The SEED program will be used to help businesses recover as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and encourage new, innovative proposals that reflect the realities of the new post-COVID-19 economy. A key milestone in the re-opening of SEED applications was the establishment of CanNor’s Northern Business Relief Fund on April 20, 2020.

This morning I am here to talk a bit about some changes coming out of the Department of Lands, in response to the impacts of COVID-19.  The physical distancing and isolation measures used to combat the spread of COVID-19 have created new and very real economic stress on Northwest Territories residents, families, businesses, Indigenous governments and communities.  The Government of the Northwest Territories understands these financial stresses and continues to make changes to our programs, services, and policies.  That’s why the Department of Lands is going to ease some of the burden, by waiving rent on existing surface leases on public land, for the fiscal year 2020-21.  The fair and equitable treatment of all leaseholders is important.  Big or small, they are all impacted by the current crisis.  The COVID-19 pandemic affects all NWT residents and businesses and the rent relief will help limit expenses, and keep cash available for immediate needs in this time of uncertainty. The rent relief is available to all holders of existing recreational, residential, and commercial and mining surface leases.  The rent relief will also apply to easements or licences of occupation and will be applied retroactively to April 1, 2020 until March 31, 2021.  This will allow all leaseholders to receive the same rent relief as those who received it at the beginning of the pandemic, but will not apply to new applications received after April 1, 2020.   If you’re a lease holder and your rent has already been paid for the 2020/21 fiscal year, and your account is in good standing, your payment will be automatically refunded.  These are challenging times for many, and the Government of the Northwest Territories will continue to do what we can do ease the financial burden our residents are faced with and make sure our residents feel safe.

I would like to thank the NWT Chamber for their role in this success.   “We still have some work to do – and the GNWT will continue to advocate for additional federal support across all sectors – but particularly in the business sector where we have identified two key gaps; support for home-based businesses and support for our tourism sector.  “We continue to call on the federal government to work with the GNWT and the NWT business community to create a stimulus package to help businesses adapt to the changing business environment.”   "

I’d like to specifically thank Jenni for the invitation to address your membership.  This is the first chance that I have had to do so since being elected, and though I wish we could have done it in person, I am glad all the same.  Outside of the immediate task of navigating the COVID-19 crisis, the Government of the Northwest Territories’ broad mandate is to improve the lives of the people it serves.  The products and services provided by members of this Chamber – day in and day out – play a big part in doing that.   I want to recognize the work of your Executive Director. You are in good hands with Renee and I have committed to meeting with her regularly to hear about your work as a Chamber and ensure that the relationship between the Chamber and the GNWT remains strong.  As the Minister responsible for ensuring the health of the Northwest Territories’ economy, I must also thank the NT Chamber for your continued advocacy on behalf of Northwest Territories businesses.   In particular, your April 24th letter to the Honourable Mélanie Joly served to reinforce what she has already heard from our government and from other Northwest Territory interest groups. Collectively, our territory – its governments, business chambers, and stakeholder organizations – have been able to create an important awareness in Ottawa about the need for specific and regionally-appropriate support programs for Northwest Territories businesses.   It’s a message that I have personally been loud and persistent in delivering, and it’s a message that seems to be getting through.  CanNor’s Northern Business Relief Fund has significantly expanded relief options for Northwest Territories and Indigenous businesses; and we were able to secure additional support for the North’s airline industry. I want to thank you all for your role in this success.   We know we still have work to do, and we will continue to advocate for more supports. This includes our home-based businesses as well as additional supports for our tourism sector. This work is ongoing. The Premier laid out some of the principles behind our social and economic recovery plan last week in a presentation to our colleagues in the Legislative Assembly.  I want to especially thank Jenni (Bruce) for agreeing to co-chair the new Business Advisory Council that will help lead the way forward.   I can tell you that we are planning for a slow and steady - but long - period of recovery.  Our economy will continue to be reliant on our resource sector and on our diamond mines.  We are working to ensure that our mines can operate through this crisis because we will need them to anchor our recovery. Mining and exploration is the biggest source of private sector jobs and income for our residents and a major buyer of products and services from our businesses.  The Chief Public Health Officer has said that for the foreseeable future our borders will remain closed to non-essential traffic.   When it happens, economic recovery will need to begin within our territory; and it will depend greatly on what we can do together and for each other.  We have just this week re-opened our SEED program.  It represents $4 million dollars of potential investment into our communities.  Our intent is to prioritize proposals that are forward-looking, where community employment is emphasized, and the bulk of the funds will be spent locally. Obviously, we will continue, as you have, to lobby the federal government to work with us and the Northwest Territories business community to help businesses recover and adapt to the changing business environment.   We will also be asking Northwest Territories residents to play a role.    The importance of the “Buy North”, or “Spend NWT”, message has never been as true as it is today.   And, I can tell you, it is a message that will extend to residents and governments equally.  Within the Departments of ITI and Infrastructure we are already considering changes to our procurement policies and practices to expand our support of Northwest Territories business coming out of this crisis.   We took our first step in that direction last week with our decision to support Northwest Territories manufacturers in a way that will allow them to meet our territory’s demand for Personal Protective Equipment.  As work continues on the plan to re-open the Northwest Territories’ economy, businesses need to do their part to prepare so they can be ready to open up when the time is right. Physical distancing measures are likely to be in place for a long-time.  Additional PPE will be required for many businesses as they prepare to re-open.  If you are looking for a take-away message from me this afternoon - it is that we are changing our thinking – and ever-so-cautiously beginning to look ahead.   But we are only able to do so because of the work that we have already done across our government: By providing those early loans to ensure liquidity while we sorted out next steps;   By finding ways for the mines to operate through the pandemic; By implementing a pause for  the resource exploration sector while we secure a longer term solution;   By securing the supply chain; By eliminating fees and speeding up payments to NWT companies;  But most importantly, by working and lobbying Canada and its Northern Economic Development Agency to provide relief where and when it was needed most.   Given the scarcity of our financial resources, it was important to us that GNWT programs compliment federal programs as opposed to duplicating them.   Our approach means that we can now commit our full financial capacity to the purposes of economic recovery. If there is a silver lining, I believe the collective world-wide effort that will be put into economic recovery will bring new opportunities.  If we can position ourselves to learn from the wave of innovation that I believe we will see, perhaps we can re-imagine our own economy for the future; one that continues to promote our wealth of natural resources but also encourages a more diversified and resilient economy that builds upon our natural strengths. I promise that we will throw everything we have as a government into identifying and implementing a recovery effort that will enable us to emerge from this crisis with a brighter future.  If there is ever a place where the people are adaptable and creative it’s the north. And it is that adaptability and creativity that will allow us to emerge from this pandemic stronger than ever. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today and I hope to have many similar opportunities again in the future.  Have a great afternoon. "

I want to begin by saying that our thoughts are with the people of Hay River who are facing flood risks alongside a pandemic.  We appreciate the work everyone is doing on the frontlines to keep people safe from the flood, and making sure good public health practices are followed as much as possible as the response unfolds.  And I urge everyone to be kind to each other. Everyone is under a lot of stress. Making sure we’re all helping out and taking care of each other can go a long way in helping us stay strong emotionally and mentally as emergency response continues.  We are through yet another week and all indications say we have remained successful in containing the spread of COVID-19 in our territory.  I am pleased to say that we have also seen a rise in testing since expanding our clinical criteria – which is exactly what we wanted.  We saw 147 tests collected between April 27 and May 1st – the first full work week since announcing our expanded criteria. Compare that to 87 collected from April 20 - April 24. That’s a 59% increase – and we hope that trend continues as we move forward.  I am pleased to say that we’re on the homestretch in developing our plan to emerge from our current levels of restrictions.  These next days will be about preparing for these next steps.  We are finalizing the public presentation of the plan so residents see a clear path forward for gradually, safely emerging from these public health measures – and how it will affect their lives. And we are working with our partners to develop guidance for businesses and organizations so they can understand and implement the requirements they will need to meet to take advantage of eased measures in the near future.   I am excited to share these details with you as soon as I can.  And as I do each week, I want to thank NWT residents for the extraordinary commitment they’ve demonstrated to fighting back against COVID-19. As of today, we’ve contained this together.  And together, we will continue to rise to the challenge.  Thank you. "

Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) met with territorial education leaders and the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) during their biweekly teleconference on May 5, 2020 to further discuss continued learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on what is currently being done to support families and students with complex needs. Leaders shared the work underway by educational staff in each region to help families support at-home learning and mental well-being for students with complex needs during this unprecedented time of school closures, and the areas where more support is needed. Education bodies have reported needing further assistance with planning for students with complex needs, meeting respite requests from families and emerging counselling needs, and centralizing resources for educators that focus on complex needs. ECE continues to work collaboratively with education bodies on continuity of learning for all students, including those with Student Support Plans and Individual Education Plans. Education staff are taking into consideration the needs of all students in preparing lessons, materials and resources for distance learning. Program Support Teachers work collaboratively with education staff to help design and plan for students by providing resources like learning kits and visual aids, connecting families virtually with consultants, and doing check-ins to ensure families feel supported and can reach out for more help if needed. Support Assistants that have not been redeployed have been reaching out to connect with students and families and provide virtual support where possible. Assistive technology is also being made available to households as needed. A variety of resources for teachers and parents have been developed by educators across the territory, and education bodies are working together to create a centralized resource database to make activities and resources that support at-home learning for students with complex needs available to Regional Inclusive Schooling Coordinators across the NWT. ECE is also ensuring the continued availability of remote counselling services for students during COVID-19. A total of 34 mental health counsellors continue to provide services to 47 schools in the territory, and all education bodies have been provided with a master list of counsellors in the NWT in order to ensure services can be accessed quickly by JK-Grade 12 students when necessary. Work is underway to ensure students in need have the technology to access counselling, safely and privately. The Department is also exploring ways to provide families with access to respite services during the COVID-19 pandemic. With ECE support and health guidance from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer, education bodies across the NWT are maintaining food programs for families in need by supplying prepared packages of food, partnering with community agencies, sharing food funding or staff, providing grocery vouchers or accounts, and delivering takeout meals, depending on the unique needs and circumstances of the community. This flexible approach is proving successful, and education bodies are looking at ways to sustain healthy foods programming through the summer.  As well, an increasing number of requests for Jordan’s Principle and Child First Initiative funding continue to be made by individuals in the NWT and by NWT schools, for both this school year and next.  The next meeting of education leaders with Minister Simpson is scheduled for Tuesday, May 19, 2020. Quotes “Schools provide so much more than learning for students and families in the NWT; they provide vital supports and offer a safe and caring environment for many of our youth. This is especially true for students who require additional help, whether through counselling, learning aids, assistive technology or healthy snacks. For students with complex needs, the effects of school closures due to COVID-19 are particularly challenging. ECE is working hard to support education staff and families to access the resources they need for at-home learning and mental well-being during this difficult time, and ensure our most vulnerable students continue to receive the critical supports they depend on.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “For the bulk of our students, learning is moving forward positively. Teachers and program support teachers have also reached out to parents of students with learning difficulties to assist them in understanding what the schools have in place for their child, and how to translate that information into meaningful support for parents teaching their child at home. Assistive technology, software and material resources have been distributed to families. For all education bodies, the well-being of all of their students and parents is extremely important. Our goal is to be as responsive to all needs as we can in this new delivery model.” -Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders Related Links Education Bulletin - March 31, 2020 Resources for parents to support learning at home Resources for parents and students - Mental health and wellness Supporting your child with complex needs: Learning at home during school closures Media contact: Cabinet Communications  PressSecretary@gov.nt.ca"

Simpson announced the exemption of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) for Income Assistance (IA) clients. These benefits would normally be counted as unearned income and would affect a client’s IA benefit amount. The IA program provides financial assistance to residents, aged 19 years or older, to assist with their basic and enhanced needs.  These needs include the actual costs associated with shelter and utilities, as well as set amounts for food, clothing and additional allowances for Seniors and Persons with Disabilities.  Food and clothing amounts are based on family size and the location of community. The CERB payment, which is available to Canadians who have earned a minimum of $5,000 through employment over the last 12 months and who have lost income due to COVID-19,  provides $2,000 per month up to four months to eligible residents. The CESB payment provides $1,250 per month to eligible postsecondary students who are not eligible for the CERB. Eligible students include those in existing programs, recent graduates, and those registered for a postsecondary program in fall 2020.  For disabled students or students with dependents, the CESB provides $2,000 per month. These benefits are available from May through August 2020.  This latest announcement is in addition to the changes made to the program in March to support the Northwest Territories’ most vulnerable residents.    Quote: “While we have continued to support the most vulnerable residents in the territory with flexible changes and advice during these difficult times, we have further opportunities to leverage the federal government benefits, as a number of other jurisdictions across the country have done. With many people out of work and students that have few prospects for summer employment, there are unique challenges facing families and individuals. Any assistance we can provide to help reduce some of the stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is an action we will swiftly take.”   - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “I thank Minister Simpson and his government for their leadership in deciding to exempt Canada Emergency Response Benefit payments for income assistance clients. This will ensure that some of our most vulnerable Canadians, including persons with disabilities, receive the supports they need during this pandemic. The response to this pandemic has been a Team Canada effort, and today’s announcement illustrates how collaboration helps protect the well-being and safety of Canadians.” 					- Hon. Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, Government of Canada    Quick Facts: On March 23, all GNWT buildings were closed, and essential employees continued to work with clients and the public by phone and email.  All Client Services Officers continue to serve Income Assistance clients, seniors, persons with disabilities, and students. Exempting the federal benefits is an addition to the number of flexible changes made through Income Security Programs to support NWT residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Income Assistance Clients applying for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit are encouraged to review eligibility requirements here.  The Canada Emergency Student Benefit is available to postsecondary students from May through August 2020. Both the CERB and the CESB are taxable benefits.

Yellowknife Women’s Centre Transitional Housing Starting today, as part of the COVID-19 homelessness response plan, the suites located in the former Arnica Inn building will start accepting individuals using local shelters who would be at very high risk of serious illness if they were to contract COVID-19. This includes people over the age of 60, those with underlying health conditions like asthma or diabetes, or other vulnerabilities.  This new option was made possible through a partnership between the Yellowknife Women’s Society and the Government of the Northwest Territories. At this time 25 rooms are available, which is sufficient to meet the need.  There is remaining capacity for additional clients if demand increases.  Day and Sobering Centre Also starting today the Yellowknife Day and Sobering Centre, operated by the NWT Disabilities Council, will re-establish operations as a drop-in day centre and sobering centre offering services 7 days a week.

This financial support will help offset costs directly associated with loss of income to operators since the closure of recycling depots on March 19, 2020 due to COVID-19. For processing centres, a one-time payment of $5,000 will be provided while staff and operators explore federal funding opportunities. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources will also continue scheduled grant payments to depots that were in regular operation prior to COVID-19 closure.

It is my hope that this new financial support for these small community-based businesses will assist them until they are able to once again open their doors.” -Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources   QUICK FACTS: There are three regional processing centres in the Northwest Territories eligible for the one-time payment. They are in Inuvik, Hay River and Yellowknife. At least twelve depot operators are eligible for continued grants under the COVID-19 Recycling Operator Support Program. This program was created to help ensure the long-term viability of licensed beverage container depots and processing centres in the Northwest Territories (NWT) and is intended to sustain depots that regularly operated depots in the 2019/20 fiscal year. Depot grants are calculated based on the NWT Food Price Index, the size of the community served by the depot, and whether the depot is a school or a registered non-profit organization. Monthly reporting is not required to trigger grant payments during the state of emergency. Bottle deposits and fees are a critical part of the Beverage Container Program and will remain in place. Residents are encouraged to hold on to their bottles until depots are able to re-open. More than 28 million beverage containers were distributed and more than 24 million were returned in the last fiscal year. The total number of containers returned over the life of the program is more than 336 million.   For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

The best way to protect yourself and your family is to be prepared. The communities of Hay River, Fort Simpson, Fort Liard, Nahanni Butte, Tulita, Fort Good Hope, Fort McPherson, Aklavik and Tuktoyaktuk are all in flood prone areas and residents in these communities are encouraged to take steps to ensure they are prepared and protected.  This flood season has many unique considerations due to the Territorial response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Regional staff with Municipal and Community Affairs are working with at risk communities to ensure emergency and evacuation plans are compliant with the public health measures currently in place. In the event of a flood in your Region, residents may see or hear a public alert through the NWT Alert system on cell phones, radio stations and cable networks. The NWT Alert system provides public alerts to NWT residents during emergencies and disasters and is part of the national public alerting system “Alert Ready.” Alert Ready is designed to deliver critical and potentially life-saving alerts to Canadians through television, radio and cell phones.   The Alert Ready system has been developed in partnership with federal, provincial and territorial emergency management officials, Environment Canada and the broadcast industry to ensure you receive alerts immediately and know when to take action to keep yourself and your family safe.  For more information on public alerting and the Alert Ready system visit www.alertready.ca NWT residents are reminded to be aware of the risk in their area, have an emergency plan and kit ready.

This week, we’ve been focused on planning for emerging gradually, and safely, from our current levels of public health restrictions.  The changes we’ve introduced to our Public Health Orders this week are allowing us to consider taking these first steps.  Because if we can track those entering our territory when they’re at highest-risk of transmission, and keep our boundaries strong, we can bring more freedom and stability to our residents as we continue our response to this virus.  My team and I are working around-the-clock – analyzing all the data we have on transmission dynamics, cases, deaths, and the situation across Canada and the globe – and deliberating on the best way to move forward with our territory’s unique needs in mind.  But I’ll echo my statement from last week, and impress just how important it is we get this plan right from the start – and that we communicate this shift to all residents correctly.  With that in-mind, we will be continuing our work this week to get this right from the start, and we look forward to sharing details of how we plan to do that as soon as possible.  What I can share right now is some of the things we’ll be considering:  The right way to ease restrictions on gatherings;  How to safely provide businesses with relief; The best ways to manage returns to work within government and schools;  How to continue to protect against further introduction of COVID-19 within our territory; and  How to keep our most vulnerable safe until we get a vaccine.  We will not have further details today because it is important we present a plan with the triggers, milestones, and parameters defined right away so we do not confuse residents.  Lastly, as I do every week, I want to offer my deepest gratitude to NWT residents and organizations who have taken this seriously, and made extraordinary sacrifices from the start.  It is your efforts to follow our orders, and change your lifestyles, that has kept your communities, and our loved ones, safe.  Together, we have planked the curve – something very few have achieved thus far.  And if we do this right, and we are all really careful, we’re in a position to keep it going through the second and third waves we are expecting to see across the rest of Canada.  So be proud of yourselves – because even though it might not feel like it sometimes, you are all doing something amazing right now.  Thank you.                           "

Both extensions will take effect as of April 29, 2020 and expire on May 12, 2020. These extensions are due to the continued need for response to the COVID-19 global pandemic to protect public health in the Northwest Territories and do not indicate a significant change in circumstances or an increased risk to the people of the NWT. Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Kami Kandola.  Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. A Public Health Emergency allows the Chief Public Health Officer to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic. Extending the State of Emergency ensures the Emergency Management Organization (EMO) continues to be in a position to support the orders issued by the Chief Public Health Officer. While the Northwest Territories is currently in containment mode, with no evidence of community spread and all cases recovered, the situation can change quickly without carefully managing the continued response.    Nationwide spread is the biggest risk of expanding spread within the Northwest Territories and Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably across Canada.  These extensions reflect the need to remain vigilant and swiftly respond to any changes to the current situation in the Northwest Territories. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continues to enhance our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an ongoing effort to protect the health of the residents of the Northwest Territories. All residents are reminded to follow the orders and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer during this challenging time.   For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

For example, a family of two adults and two children will receive $224.00. For a child in shared custody each parent will receive one-half of the benefit for the child.   The NWT Cost of Living Offset (COLO) is a benefit paid to individuals and families living in the NWT to help offset the cost of the NWT carbon tax. The benefit is tax-free to NWT residents and families.   To be eligible for the  April 30th COLO payment, one must be an NWT resident for at least three months before the payment date and have filed an income tax and benefit return for the 2018 year.   Starting in July 2020, annual  COLO amounts will increase to $156  for an individual and $180 per child and payments will be issued quarterly. Single individuals in the NWT will receive their full annual payment in July because their quarterly payments would be less than $50.    NWT residents will automatically receive the July 2020 quarterly payment if they have filed their 2019 tax return before June 1st, 2020.   The Canada Revenue Agency issues all COLO payments on behalf of the Government of the NWT. Payments will be issued by cheque or direct deposit based on the information and preferences  recipients have on file with the Canada Revenue Agency. There is only one payment issued per household.    NWT residents who are eligible for the April 2020 COLO payment but have not received it by May 18th, 2020 are directed to call the Canada Revenue Agency’s dedicated individual and benefits enquiries line at 1-866-426-1527.   Quote   “The NWT Cost of Living Offset payments are an important part of the Government of the Northwest Territories commitment to all territorial residents to help offset the cost of the NWT carbon tax.  The timing of the April 30th payment will provide families with a welcome boost of funds that may help reduce their financial stress as we all work to support each other through the COVID-19 health crisis.” -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance     Quick Facts   The NWT Carbon Tax became effective September 1st, 2019 and the first  COLO payment was distributed in October 2019. The COLO benefit is not based on family income and will increase as the carbon tax rate increases. There is no need to apply for  COLO as the Canada Revenue Agency determines eligibility and issues payments to all entitled individuals and families.

These new measures cover practices like social distancing after entering the territory, symptom declarations, and other accountability and tracking measures to enhance COVID-19 protection and response in the NWT. The purpose of this shift is to put additional protections in-place to mitigate the risks inherent in welcoming out-of-territory workers who may be traveling from locations where COVID-19 community spread has occurred, and track where they are and what they’re doing when in the NWT. NWT Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola has indicated that ramping up risk reduction related to out-of-territory travel, alongside tightened border measures, are the first pieces which must fall into place as the territory looks towards a relaxing of public health measures.   Quote “There’s only one shot you get at containment, and I’m proud of the work our territory has done to achieve it. All this doesn’t happen by itself, and we still have a lot of work ahead to keep us in containment while a vaccine is developed.

They are critical to the structure and function of our communities and provide almost all of the products and services that we enjoy and rely on as Northerners.  “The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT)’s support for small business is more important given our current situation than ever before. This can be seen in person, through our pathfinders and staff working with small businesses across the NWT; in financial supports through our economic relief packages; and in our advocacy efforts on behalf of small businesses with the federal government including constant engagement with CanNor, their northern economic development agency. “Earlier this month, I endorsed on behalf of the GNWT, a letter from the NWT/NU Chamber of Mines and Yukon Chamber of Mines to the Government of Canada defining the need and level of support required by resource companies operating in the NWT.  Today, I want to ensure our business community understands that this same level of support is extended to them. “COVID-19 has already had immense impacts on our economy, our businesses, and our people. While the magnitude of these impacts is yet to be determined, we know they will exist for all companies, and federal support must be considered through a distinctly northern lens. “On behalf of the NWT’s business sector, I have, this week, supported the Yellowknife Chamber of Commerce in its lobby efforts with the Federal Government to ensure relief programs, developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect the unique realities of operating in the North. “Business, when looked at with a northern context, is not the same as in the south. Revenues and profits for our small business sector are far below those of comparable companies in southern Canada; and there are unique logistical and climatic challenges that come with successfully operating in our northern environment.  “These are challenging times, but I am confident that by working together we can move past this crisis and seize on the opportunity to build and create a stronger, healthier economy for our Territory. “I will continue to collaborate with my federal and territorial counterparts to identify economic support and recovery initiatives for the North in order to advance the wellbeing, health, and livelihoods of all Northerners.”"

Today, Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance, and R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE), are announcing additional support for essential workers responding to COVID-19 that will ensure access to child care. The GNWT, through ECE, is providing $5.106 million to immediately create four temporary child care initiatives that will support parents providing essential services during the COVID-19 public health emergency and lessen the financial impacts on licensed family day homes and centre-based child care programs.  The initiatives include: A $1.9-million subsidy to lower child care costs by 33% for parents who are required to physically attend work and who need child care during COVID-19.  A $1,000 per month wage top-up for child care staff, to ensure both licensed family day homes and centre-based early learning and child care programs are adequately resourced to provide child care services, especially during non-regular hours, for a total value of $1.3 million.  $665,000 in additional resources to ensure licensed child care programs receive adequate support for supplies and labour to carry out enhanced cleaning regimens at child care centres, and to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff and clients.  A $1.24-million subsidy to offset a portion of the fixed costs, such as rent and utilities, for licensed early learning and child care programs that have closed due to COVID-19. While ideally child care programs will remain open as essential services wherever possible, this subsidy is designed to support the ability of programs to re-open when the health risks associated with COVID-19 have decreased.  These initiatives will prioritize direct health and allied healthcare workers, as well as any parents required to physically attend a worksite during the pandemic. ECE has also been working with the Department of Health and Social Services to match child care services with the identified needs of Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority (NTHSSA), the Hay River Health and Social Services Authority and the Tłı̨chǫ Community Services Agency staff as an additional level of support for both parents and programs. ECE staff have provided a one-stop registration process for NTHSSA employees to find available child care spots and are matching them with known vacancies in open programs. The new supports come into effect immediately, and complement the previous two waves of economic measures announced earlier this month to support people, businesses and communities in response to COVID-19, creating a total of $26.565 million in GNWT financial support announced to date.  Quotes: “Parents who are providing healthcare and other essential services in response to COVID-19 are experiencing increased child care pressures due to self-isolation and physical distancing requirements.

Simpson: News Conference, Financial Supports for Child Care during COVID-19","Check against delivery    Good afternoon.   The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many challenges for our residents and communities as we take the necessary steps to protect each other by staying physically distant and self-isolating.   For residents with children, there are additional and significant challenges now that children are at home as a result of school closures and the cancellation of many child care programs.   While some parents are able to care for their children while working from home - challenging as that may be - there are others, such as doctors, nurses, grocery store workers, water truck drivers, and so on, who must still work outside the home in order to provide the essential services that we all rely on, and that will keep the people of the Northwest Territories safe and healthy.   These essential workers are now experiencing increased child care pressures as a result of COVID-19.   Many parents who are critical frontline staff are also putting in irregular and additional hours at work in order to respond to the ever-evolving COVID-19 situation and to the increased demands on the healthcare system.   Normally, some of these pressures could be mitigated through staggered shifts, after-school programs, and care provided by friends and family.   For many parents, those options are no longer available due to the need for self-isolation and physical distancing.   Supporting access to child care for parents who are providing essential services in response to COVID-19 is critical for us to be able to address this public health emergency.   Today, I am pleased to announce over $5 million in additional funding to help those parents continue to access child care as they respond to COVID-19.   In consultation with childcare providers, the Department of Education, Culture, and Employment, and the Department of Finance have worked together to develop four (4) temporary child care programs that will support access to child care for essential workers, and will lessen the negative financial impacts of COVID-19 on licensed early learning and child care programs.   First, we will subsidize an additional 33% of the child care costs for parents who are required to physically attend work during COVID-19. This is on top of the per child subsidy that is already provided directly to childcare programs to help lower the fees they need to charge to parents.     Second, we will increase to the Staff Grant Wage Subsidy program to provide up to an additional $1,000 a month to child care workers, to ensure programs are properly resourced - especially during non-regular hours, when essential shift workers need their child care services the most.   This Staff Grant Wage Subsidy is typically only available to staff in licensed centre-based programs, but the increase will also be made available to family day home operators, so we can mitigate the impacts of lost child care fees on their program sustainability.   Third, we will make $665,000 available to licensed child care programs to be used for additional cleaning supplies and labour needed for enhanced disinfecting regimes at child care centres. This money will also be used to purchase personal protective equipment for staff and clients.    Finally, we will provide a subsidy to partially offset fixed costs, such as rent and utilities, for licensed early learning and child care programs that have closed due to COVID-19.   This is intended to prevent these costs from being passed on to parents who want to keep their child care spots at closed centres. It will also bolster the ability of programs to eventually re-open, which will be essential to our economic recovery.   We will continue to listen and respond to the needs and concerns of parents and child care providers across the territory as we move forward in our efforts to address COVID-19.   I want to thank each of our essential workers, including our child care providers, for helping us get through these unprecedented and challenging times, together.    We need each and every one of you, and will continue to find ways to support your vital efforts as you serve and protect our residents throughout the COVID-19 pandemic."

Our population has many pre-existing health vulnerabilities, low rates of educational outcomes and a recent history of both individual and collective trauma stemming in part from residential schools. COVID-19 has brought the collective impacts of these realities, and other challenges, into sharp focus. Even with all this adversity, I am proud of the way that Northwest Territories residents, businesses and governments have rallied to respect the health measures put in place to minimize COVID-19 cases and keep it out of our remote communities.  My opening comments will speak to both our challenges and our opportunities that COVID-19 has brought into sharp focus and the responses we believe are needed to build a strong, sustainable north.   Strengths Our people: The Northwest Territories is made up of strong, resilient people. We are at our best when we work together, as is demonstrated by active collaboration between public and Indigenous governments. Mineral resources: Significant mineral resource potential across the NWT’s vast geography continues to exist. Notable examples are lithium and rare earth minerals which could gain greater prominence if COVID-19 advances the conversation about increased use of technology green energy.  The NWT is a key entry point to the Arctic Ocean and the Northwest Passage: The geopolitical importance of the Arctic as well as direct economic potential is unaffected by COVID-19.  Cultural diversity: Celebrate and protect 11 official languages, each one translated in our Legislative Assembly. Cultural knowledge, particularly interest in Indigenous cultures and language, is an area of growing interest around the world.  Many of our strengths have not been diminished by COVID-19. Anecdotal evidence thus far suggests that the aggressive measures announced by the federal government combined with our own government’s support for Northwest Territories residents and businesses will do much to stabilize the immediate economic situation. We are especially appreciative of the programs targeted specifically for the North such as the $8.7 million to support NWT airlines to ensure continued supply. Challenges brought into focus by COVID-19 The NWT has the largest infrastructure deficit in Canada. We have airports that allow limited aircraft, a small handful of emergency shelters in only a few regional centres and high food insecurity. COVID-19 has highlighted and in some cases exacerbated these weaknesses.  Other examples: Education: Many schools outside of the capital rely on teachers who travel to southern Canada, or abroad, during all school breaks and many of those school districts still do not have a full complement of teachers returned after “March break.” Every school district is struggling to provide web-based schooling without sufficient access to computer hardware in homes and limited internet connectivity across the Territory. Heat and energy sources: People staying home has resulted in higher energy use in an already high cost environment. Of note, most communities rely on diesel fuel to heat their homes and often as the community’s primary electricity generation.  Lest you think the recent fuel price drop is helpful, keep in mind that fuel is purchased far in advance and sent to communities on ice roads. Fuel delivered to communities in February and March was at a much higher price than we see today. Overcrowded housing and housing insecurity leading to intransient housing puts more people into contact with one another, often simultaneously suffering from lower pre-existing health resiliency. This is a perfect environment for COVID-19 to spread.  A lack of transportation infrastructures results in communities depending on airlines for food and medical supply chains. Those airlines today are in trouble, with at least one having closed its doors already.  At present, we have limited own source revenue options. Those revenues have been further depleted by our efforts to provide immediate relief to the financial pressures created by the collective response to COVID-19. In addition, the reduction in revenue resulting from a loss in personal and corporate income as well as mineral royalties is expected to have a major impact. Although we appreciate the financial help from Canada to date, we will need more.  We already have limited fiscal room which impacts our ability to be primary investors in major projects and can create fiscal challenges to act as partners if an investment relationship is predefined.  Opportunities  We were forced to hit a pause button on regular government business and the pursuit of our Government’s priorities in order to contain COVID-19 but as we plan to restart, we have the opportunity to think about what that restart will look like, with a vision of who we want to be in the future.  We are assessing which projects are shovel ready but could be delayed due to fiscal constraints.  We also have several projects that are what I call next-stage ready. These are projects that are at some stage of design, planning or permitting. These include:  Telecommunications connectivity expansion and capacity improvement;  The expansion of hydroelectric capacity at the Taltson hydro facility with a view to moving the NWT towards cleaner energy both in homes and available to industry so that we can be leader in greener mining, for example; Exploration of the Slave Geological Province and the potential to provide the first direct transportation corridor to Nunavut;  The expansion of hydro electricity transmission lines across the south; and The introduction and expansion of community based solar and wind projects. Recommendations  Ensure sufficient borrowing flexibility and a broader diversity of infrastructure investment partnership options including opportunities for Indigenous Governments as equity partners. This includes being able to stack funding and in some cases 100% dollars;  Advance the Broadband 2020 Fund and the promise of broadband access into all homes and communities in the Northwest Territories; and Identify social and economic goals within the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework that can be funded for action immediately or funded for immediate next stage planning and commit to doing so in collaboration with the arctic and northern communities who are eager to be on par with the rest of Canada. We know that countries that invest in the Arctic see real benefits, whether from the natural resources, the access to traditional knowledge or new opportunities in communications and transportation. We believe this is true of Canada’s north as well. We look forward to a continuing partnership with Canada to achieve this goal. "

These changes are especially important during these challenging times due to the COVID-19 pandemic where many residents are working reduced hours or have lost their jobs.  The TRSP provides rent supplement to residents renting in the private market. If residents have low-to-modest income and their shelter costs are unaffordable, they may be eligible for assistance under the program.  Notable enhancements to the program include:         5-month duration to August 31, 2020        No requirement to take an NWTHC financial counselling course        No requirement to be arrears-free        Previous participants are eligible        Minimum $100 – maximum $500/month        Simplified application – available on NWTHC website        Phone inquiries to 1-844-698 4663 (1-844-NWT-HOME) TRSP, which was previously going to be discontinued on March, 31, 2020 has been extended until August 31, 2020. The NWTHC and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) are working collaboratively to develop a rental support program called the Canada Housing Benefit, which is scheduled to be available in September 2020.  Quote:  “There are families that are struggling to pay their rent. They may not be working or may be working less. The Transitional Rent Supplement Program is good resource for families struggling to keep current with their rent payments.

301,2020-04-22,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/minister-and-education-leaders-meet-share-progress-continued-learning-during-covid-19,Government Website,Minister and Education Leaders meet to share progress on continued learning during COVID-19,"The Honourable R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) met with territorial education leaders and the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) again on April 21, 2020 to discuss continued learning for Northwest Territories (NWT) students during the time of school closures as a result of COVID-19.   Leaders from all regions of the NWT joined the Minister and other ECE officials on the biweekly teleconference to discuss progress to date and share innovative work underway across regions to support teachers, parents and students with learning at home.   All schools across the NWT have begun supplying their students with at-home learning packages, either through pick-up, delivery, mail-outs or email, as a way to accommodate and support students with and without home computers and Internet access. These packages provide enough school work for one to two weeks of learning, and students can either email or drop off completed packages at schools while following protocols for physical distancing.   Where possible, schools have supplied students with laptops or tablets, and have moved their classrooms online onto platforms such as Moodle or Google Classroom. Teachers have set up virtual learning support centres, including Facebook groups and sections of their websites, to share video tutorials and other resources designed to support students and families using these new applications.   Recognizing that this is a challenging time for all families, students and teachers, many education bodies have dedicated first weeks of distance learning to supporting student and family wellness. For example, East Three Secondary and Elementary Schools in Inuvik are offering phone counselling for their students and have set up a ‘Health and Wellness’ Facebook group, while K'àlemì Dene School in Ndilǫ focused their first week of teaching on how to set up a daily routine, doing outdoor scavenger hunts and writing personal wellness plans.    Healthy foods programming continues to be made available to students outside of schools. In each region, a range of food hampers, gift cards, grocery store accounts and cooked meals are being provided to households in need, either directly or via the local Indigenous government’s food security initiatives.   With the support of ECE, teachers are continuing to follow curriculum while tailoring approaches to accommodate the new distance learning situation. These system-wide supports include new assessment tools for distance and land-based learning, with the understanding that many families are spending time on the land as a way to stay safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as temporary processes for high school course completion, links to online learning resources, helpful information on safe use of technology, and resources for parents.   To stay connected as a school community, teachers have been sharing video messages to their students over social media, holding teacher parades to greet their students from a safe distance, sharing student artwork and photos online, and hosting online school spirit days.   Schools and communities have also banded together to provide additional activities and encourage students to stay engaged from their homes through things like creative writing, reading and on-the-land photo contests. Through social media, students and families have been connected with a number of free online resources, including large selections of online books and stories, as well as educational games and activities, and mental wellness supports. There continue to be challenges that will likely persist for the remainder of the school year. The lack of home computers and Internet access, as well as the struggles that come from shifting to an at-home learning environment, are obstacles that teachers and staff, with the support of ECE, will continue to find ways to work around. Educators will continue to show flexibility and creativity in adapting their approach to providing learning and wellness supports to students during this time.   The next meeting of education leaders with Minister Simpson is scheduled for Tuesday, May 5, 2020. Quotes: “When education leaders in the Northwest Territories decided collectively to close schools for the remainder of the school year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognized the significant impact this decision would have on students, families, staff and communities, and were committed to finding options to support continued learning for all NWT students. I am deeply moved and inspired by the dedication of our hard-working educators, who have shown flexibility and creativity in adapting distance learning and wellness supports for our students to meet their wide-ranging household needs. By continuing to exchange solutions and innovations, NWT education leaders are supporting one another in providing quality at-home learning for all students during this unprecedented time.” 						-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “The announcement made by education bodies to close schools until the end of the school year in response to COVID-19 is unprecedented. Many questions arose about how the various education bodies and their staff would be able to accomplish the enormous task of developing plans for continuity of learning. With Minister Simpson’s guidance, ECE, education bodies and the NWTTA created the NWT Education Bulletin, which laid out the framework and expectations around continued learning. Education bodies, school principals, teachers and support staff have embraced the challenge and connected with students and families, quickly participating in professional development activities to get acquainted with different technology and platforms, and providing students with the first set of learning plans. Although we will continue to have challenges, I’d like to congratulate all of the principals, teachers and support staff for rallying together to produce these plans that not only focus on student achievement, but are also developing resiliency in each one of us. This collective effort is a testament to our NWT education system that truly has the well-being of its students, families and staff at heart.” 						-Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   Related links: Education Bulletin - March 31, 2020 For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca   "
302,2020-04-22,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/health-measures-nwt-correction-facilities-response-covid-19-northwest-territories,Government Website,Health Measures at NWT Correction Facilities in Response to COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories,"Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Justice and Attorney General for the Northwest Territories, issued the following statement today in response to questions about inmates being released during the COVID-19 pandemic:  “As the Minister of Justice, the safety and well-being of our corrections staff, inmates and people of the Northwest Territories, is a top priority. Good government protects the well-being of all citizens, particularly the most vulnerable.  The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is aware of the particular challenges and risks that COVID-19 poses to NWT Correctional Facilities and continues to take steps to manage and mitigate these risks.  “To keep everyone safe and healthy it’s imperative we keep our incarcerated population safe. Our corrections facilities do not operate in isolation from our community. The flow of individuals entering our facilities, including workers and medical staff, can make these institutions more vulnerable to infection.  “The government’s approach has had two parts: first, safely reduce the number of people in our facilities and, second, ensure that the procedures in place to assess the health of those entering the correctional facilities rely on the best available medical evidence and techniques.  “The strategic and safe release of low-risk offenders and supporting the process by which individuals facing charges can await disposition of their matters on judicial interim release, are our best options as we work to prevent the spread of COVID-19 inside our corrections facilities, and across our territory. This initiative needs to be done carefully, thoughtfully - and most importantly - safely.  “The World Health Organization, the Canadian Bar Association, and the Canadian Human Rights Commission, among others, have all recommended governments decrease the number of inmates wherever it is safe to do so. To date, our response has been one of the most successful nationally, resulting in a reduction of approximately 22% in the number of inmates in our facilities. By reducing the population, we reduce the level of stress placed on our staff, allow those within the facility to more easily practice physical distancing, and reduce travel between NWT correctional facilities and peoples’ home communities.  “The use of early releases or Temporary Absence is in line with existing law and policy to reintegrate those who have completed a statutory period of incarceration and who meet criteria to begin their return to the community. What has changed is our emphasis on the availability of this process and the priority given to processing these applications. Offenders are not released without plans for their reintegration into the community which includes a place to reside. The majority of individuals have family homes to return to and without a place to reside an offender will not be approved for an early release.   “In addition to early releases, the Department of Justice is working with our partners in the justice system to ensure we only send individuals to jail who need to be there to ensure public safety. The legal process of seeking judicial interim release (a.k.a. “bail”) has not changed. What has changed is a more collaborative approach to determining if an individual meets the legal standard of posing a risk to public safety. The final decision on whether an individual will be released on bail rests with the Courts. As well, the delivery of judicial interim release hearings by telecommunications means that people can remain in their home communities and reduce the need to travel for their hearings.    “For those who are denied bail or are sentenced to a period of incarceration, the Department of Justice has implemented a number of safety precautions across our facilities to ensure that the health and safety of everyone entering the building is protected. All protocols are in line with direction provided by the Chief Public Health Officer.  “All new intakes to our facilities are properly screened, questioned and must be medically cleared by our health staff prior to being introduced to the general population. Our testing protocols are in line with those of the Chief Public Health Officer’s office, and while we don’t currently require all new inmates to be tested for COVID-19, our medical clearance process does include a temperature check and rigorous medical-specific questioning.  As well, staff and anyone else entering are also required to undergo screening before entering any of our facilities.   “So far, thanks to the dedication and diligence of our staff and healthcare professionals and measures implemented by the Chief Public Health Officer we’ve been able to protect our staff, health workers and inmates from the virus. No one at any of our facilities has become infected.  “The GNWT understand that this global health pandemic is fluid, and as this situation evolves, the department’s response will continue to evolve too.”    "

But as we respond to COVID-19, it’s important we both look at the facts, and remember our history.  We know that there are second and perhaps even third waves in Canada expected before we get a vaccine.  We know from history, those additional waves are often more deadly and widespread than the first. So even if Canada’s first curve flattens, we are far from through this.  And the fact is, the biggest risk to our territory is the situation across Canada – and right now, Canada’s cases continue to grow significantly each day in spite of testing rates far lower than our own.  The only way for us to keep our territory in containment through three waves across Canada is to be very careful in how we manage our response over this time.  We understand that our current levels of restriction cannot remain forever, but we also need to be very deliberate in how we weigh all of the evidence.  We are looking at infection rates, deaths, regional outbreaks, transmission dynamics, growing worries about asymptomatic spread, and rapidly evolving research we are getting all the time.  And from that data, we are looking at ways loosening our restrictions only where it makes the most sense.  We are formulating a plan for moving forward with all the information we have, and will be speaking in greater detail in the near future. "

Frontline workers at airports and enforcement checkpoints, as well as wildlife officers and healthcare workers are at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are proven to help reduce the spread of the virus. As in the rest of Canada and world, hand sanitizer is in short supply in the Northwest Territories due to increased demand during this health crisis. The GNWT has a responsibility to protect its frontline workers that are providing essential services to northerners during this public health emergency. By providing our workers with a reliable supply of hand sanitizer, we can help ensure their safety without depleting the publicly-available (commercial) supply of this critical product. QUOTES “I am incredibly grateful to all our frontline workers, including our officers, airport staff and healthcare workers, for the important work they are doing during this health crisis. Our experts at Taiga Lab are happy to be able to support them by providing a reliable supply of hand sanitizer to help keep their hands clean and reduce the spread of COVID-19. We are all in this together, and we all have a role to play in protecting our families, our elders and our communities.” 				-Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources  				  “In our response to the COVID-19 crisis, we need to use every source at our disposal to make sure our territory is ready to meet the moment. Our frontline staff can now rest a little easier knowing one of the most essential goods in their workplaces is free from the whims of the global supply chain thanks to Taiga Labs. We salute Taiga Labs for their work in making gel hand sanitizer for clinical use. We are also grateful to 62 Degrees North in stepping up to provide hand sanitizer for general use, which is critically important for essential retailers, childcare providers and residents to protect the NWT against the spread of COVID-19.” 				Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services  				  QUICK FACTS Taiga Lab is part of the GNWT Department of Environment and Natural Resources. It is the only full-service environmental analytical laboratory north of 60. The lab has state-of-the-art lab equipment, a complete lab facility, lab technicians, quality control and quality assurance personnel, as well as a chemist on staff. Taiga Lab received authorization from the Chief Public Health Officer to produce hand sanitizer, as well as a site licence and a product licence from Health Canada. The lab is able to produce up to 300 litres of hand sanitizer a day, if required. Sourcing the ingredients to produce hand sanitizer, as well as pump bottles to dispense the sanitizer, has been challenging due to worldwide shortages. So far, Taiga Lab has produced more than 1,700 litres of hand sanitizer for GNWT frontline workers.

All rent would still be payable by the tenant when their circumstances change, or when the current pandemic circumstances ease and the temporary regulation is revoked. In addition to non-payment of rent, the temporary regulation also suspends a landlord's ability to evict a tenant for a number of other reasons outlined in the Act.  Landlords may still apply to a rental officer for an eviction order after giving a tenant 10 days’ notice of eviction for reasons such as the tenant has caused repeated unreasonable disturbance of other tenant's use of the property, or has caused damage to the property and not followed orders to repair the damage, or if the safety of the landlord or other tenants has been seriously impaired by the tenant and other lease requirements.  The full Residential Tenancies (COVID-19) Regulations are available here:  https://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/en/files/legislation/residential-tenancies/residential-tenancies.r2.pdf   Quotes ""These are unprecedented times due to the global health pandemic, and we know there are going to be people who find themselves in a situation where they are unable to pay their rent in full and on time.

The declaration of a Public Health Emergency allows the Chief Public Health Officer to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic. Dr. Kandola has instituted a ban on indoor gatherings, limited outside get-togethers to less than 10 people with strict social distancing of two metres maintained, ordered the closure of certain businesses and issued strict guidance to those wishing to remain open, and ordered processes and procedures for continued operation at remote work camps in the NWT. The extension of the Public Health Emergency allows for the appropriate implementation of these new health protection measures. Thus far, the Northwest Territories has only imported cases related to travel with no evidence of community spread. Keeping ahead of the spread is the best way to stay as close to this trajectory possible, and is one way to limit the time strict measures are required for NWT residents. Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably across Canada. Nationwide spread is the biggest risk of expanding spread within the Northwest Territories.  The extension of the State of Emergency has been made in order to ensure the Emergency Management Organization (EMO) continues to be in a position to support the orders issued by the Chief Public Health Officer. Extending the State of Emergency does not indicate a significant change in circumstances or an increased risk to the people of the NWT. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continues to enhance our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an ongoing effort to protect the health of the residents of the Northwest Territories. All residents are reminded to follow these orders and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer during this challenging time."

Let’s talk for a moment about what these orders actually mean, and how we’re going to implement them The most important thing we all can to flatten the covid-19 curve is to practice physical distancing. This is something that Dr. Teresa Tam  CPHO for Canada has recommended for all Canadians. Our order on gatherings will allow private gatherings outside of no more than 10 people Provided physical distancing of 6 feet apart canoccur.  This order restricts  indoor private gatherings to only people in your immediate household. That is those you live with. Public gatherings are prohibited both indoors and outdoors  And if you’re on-the-land,  a tent or cabin is the same as your  house – no visitors from outside your household . However, you can go out on the land with others  – Just  keep six feet apart like you would at the grocery store or in public These limitations are necessary  because any time you increase number of people you are in contact with  the virus can pass to others.   We all need to keep our circles small to contain the spread. I recognize this is going to be a huge adjustment for Northwest Territories residents who enjoy having friends over for dinner and parties.   And it could put strain on relationships – where it may be difficult to stay physically apart for so long.  It is not lost on me that this will impact mental health. So what I encourage everyone to do is get creative. We’ve seen churches offering online sermons. We’re seeing people using Zoom or Google hangouts to have long chats with their friends. We’re seeing groups starting up on Facebook where people are having virtual kitchen parties to keep connected, and have some laughs. With the warmer weather and longer days-  go outdoors.  And if you need help, our health authorities are still delivering mental health services, so get in touch, and get help.  This order also mandates the closing of several kinds of businesses where proper social distancing is not possible because of the way they must operate.  These businesses are:    Tourism Operators Bottle Depots; Gyms and fitness centers; Museums and art galleries; Bars and night clubs; Theatres and movie theatres; Dine-in portions of restaurants; and  Personal service establishments I will now go through some of the exceptions in this  order.  This order excludes workers and workplaces if you’re an essential service, or a sector supporting essential services – like healthcare workers, some government services, or daycares and day homes.  It excludes facilities offering health and social services support to at-risk communities, like sobering centres and shelters.  It excludes retailers like grocery stores, gas stations, banks, and pharmacies considered to be essential to the continued function of our territory.  It excludes liquor stores, because, in the short term,  withdrawal and non-consumable alcohol consumption  amongst those experiencing addiction endangers public health more than keeping them open will.   Businesses not already mandated to close who are able to modify operations to ensure proper social distancing may also stay open, but they are not specifically excluded.  We reserve the right to revisit this, but I will say I’ve been impressed with the ingenuity of our business community’s response to COVID-19. Touchless methods of delivery, video and other ingenious methods have been great. Our order on remote work camps largely strengthens  the good practices we already recommended weeks ago, and our worksites have generally complied with already.  We are putting legal force behind them now as we understand the anxieties of our residents, and now have the enforcement capacity to address them.  These measures include things like: mandating health screenings before each shift and before coming to site;  immediate self-isolation onsite if showing symptoms; not allowing those who have symptoms to work;  social distancing measures on-and-off-rotation;  and ending buffet-style catering.  We have also made it mandatory to keep risk assessments on every employee, and allow for them to be inspected by WSCC when required.  I would like to thank everyone in our territory who has followed our recommendations over the past month. I encourage everyone to keep doing   all that you can to flatten the Covid-19 curve.   And I would like to commit to NWT residents that we will be working around-the-clock to make sure these orders work, and our communities are protected.  Thank you. "

As the spread of COVID-19 crossed our nation and touched our communities, our message has always been that our public health measures will get stronger before they let up.  And with the leadership of our Chief Public Health Officer, we have moved forward with some of the most aggressive policies in the country.  We closed our boundaries before almost anyone else.  We mandated isolation near hospitals to protect our remote communities.  We test those without connections to travel. And today, we are taking more steps to protect our families, our friends, and our communities.  Dr. Kandola has ordered all indoor gatherings across the territory to be cancelled effective tomorrow. .  Gatherings are things like house parties, funerals, church mass or spiritual congregations, feasts – any event that brings together people who do not already live together.  She has also limited outdoor gatherings to less than 10 people, and mandated social distancing for any of these which may occur.  While we provided this advice weeks ago, we are now confident it is necessary to put legal weight behind these measures to respond to this unprecedented threat.  Dr. Kandola has also ordered that certain kinds of businesses must close for the time being. This is once again a matter of putting legal force behind what our business community was already implementing as a recommendation.  And Dr. Kandola is also ordering strict screening, tracking, and protection measures at mining and oil and gas sites in the Northwest Territories effective today.  These Orders will be enforced by our Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce announced Wednesday. We are better equipped than ever to respond and investigate if our orders are not followed, and public health is put at-risk.  I am confident in Dr. Kandola, and her approach to protecting our territory.  It has served us well thus far.  But we must not get complacent. We are in this for months, not weeks, and if we aren’t all on the same team, it could be a lot longer.  So know that if you aren’t cancelling parties; if you’re still having friends over; if you’re not washing your hands, keeping six feet between each other, avoiding others as much as you can, and self-isolating if you feel sick at all, then you’re not doing your part.  And if you don’t respond to education and warnings, we’re coming for you.  I would like to hand it over to Minister Nokleby. "

The Government of the Northwest Territories recognize this.   We acknowledge that it is happening at a cost to business owners and entrepreneurs in the North; and we will continue to seek out, identify, and facilitate ways to support your efforts and address these challenges. Today, Dr. Kandola is implementing new orders around Mining and Oil and Gas. These companies have worked closely with our public health officials to implement many of these measures as advice already.   I want to emphasize that these are not measures that begin today. This mine order captures many of the precautions and safety protocols that mineral and petroleum companies have already put in place through their own efforts, and following the guidance of Public Health Officials from across the country. I want to thank our resource companies in particular for working with us and taking extraordinary measures to protect their workforce and to committing to operate safely for as long as they can.   Through this COVID-19 pandemic, our resources companies have proven themselves to be strong corporate citizens, and protocols have been in place to ensure the health and safety of our residents.  For instance, all transient employees entering the Northwest Territories are being screened with temperature testing, questionnaires, and pre-departure screening calls.  If an employee or contractor shows signs of illness or has a higher exposure risk, they are told to remain at home.  Charter aircraft flights have been introduced as much as possible to separate the travel of northern and southern workers and to reduce or eliminate interactions with commercial airline travellers. Charter flights protocols now include enhanced cleaning of aircraft, changes to or elimination of food and beverage services, and physical distancing measures. On sites, companies have been following enhanced hygiene and cleaning awareness and practices for several weeks now. Social distancing measures have been incorporated for safety meetings, transportation, all work spaces, and in dining halls and accommodations. As much as possible, southern workers are being segregated from northern workers.  All operators have also established dedicated quarantine facilities and practices.   Companies will quarantine and treat any worker with COVID-19 symptoms. Medical personnel are on site to deal with situations that occur, and there will be no hesitation in using medevac services should advance medical care be deemed necessary.  Our resource companies have worked to inform their immediate staff of the precautions that are being taken.  They have also worked to inform their communities and Indigenous IBA partners regularly, as well as reach out to see what the community needs are and help in the ways that they can during these tough times.    Similarly, the Premier and I have also taken steps to inform and advise our territory’s leaders of the extraordinary steps and initiatives being taken at these sites. The situation is evolving quickly across Canada which is why these additional measures are needed. By implementing these orders, we continue to ensure the right precautions are in-place to protect NWT residents from the risks of having a southern transient workforce entering the territory. It is our goal to reduce the risks that exists from COVID-19. We recognize that this is and will be as much of an economic crisis as it is a health one. But we are assured that the precautions that are being taken mean our remote work sites are as safe as they can be.   With the restrictions and considerations that have been put in place, our government is supportive of continued operations at worksites that have chosen to follow this path.  I would also like to recognize the importance of the resource sector to the North, now and in the future.  This includes not just our mining industry, but also our advanced project and exploration companies.   I want to reassure businesses and residents that the Government of the Northwest Territories understands the challenges you are faced with and takes this situation very seriously.   Safety is our number one priority, but next to that is ensuring that our economy remains healthy and people feel secure.  I would now like to turn it over to Dr. Kandola to explain the details of the Orders being addressed today. "

The announcement comes after forming a new Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce to track down and investigate complaints about those not following the rules of the Public Health Act or public health Orders.  Order on Mines and Oil and Gas Remote Camps to Protect Against the COVID-19 Pandemic Dr. Kandola has ordered several measures to protect public health and continue safe operations at all mining and oil and gas projects in the Northwest Territories.  The measures apply to all companies and employers operating in the sectors – parent corporations and contractors alike.  Several measures also apply to employees. This order excludes the Giant Mine Remediation project in Yellowknife. If this site is not staffed appropriately, the territory risks significant environmental damage.  The Order is effective as of 12pm on Friday April 10.     Order Bans All Gatherings, Formalizes Closure of Certain Businesses Dr. Kandola bans all indoor gatherings effective April 11. A gathering is defined as a group of people of any size who do not live in the same household who are not able to maintain social (physical) distance indoors.  This means no visitors inside any home. And it means if you are helping care for someone in your community, you must limit your time inside their living space to an absolute minimum.  This would include activities like:  House parties Funerals Meetings  Feasts  Church services  Team sports   Gathering of up to 10 people will be allowed only outdoors as long as social (physical) distance of at least two metres (six feet) can be maintained. This distance must be maintained throughout the duration of these activities.  Additionally, the advice on certain businesses closing has now been clarified and turned into an enforceable Order.  While our business community has cooperated and closed based on our advice, this Order will formalize this requirement and also ensure no businesses face barriers when applying for relief from the federal government.    For all COVID-19 media requests, please contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Presssecretary@gov.nt.ca"

There is no avoiding the economic impacts that we are challenged with, but we can look at the resources available to find creative ways to minimize the long-term impacts this virus will have on our territory, and these sectors. “The Chamber of Mines has submitted a letter seeking federal government support, specifically as it pertains to the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program – one of the resources available to businesses during this time. Like many of the benefits implemented by the Federal government in response to Covid-19, this benefit is intended to support businesses that are struggling. “The Federal government has done a great job implementing measures to support Canadians and businesses during COVID-19, but in this instance may not be aware of our unique northern challenges meeting the eligibility requirements. I have read the letter sent to the Federal government by the two Chambers of Mines and can confirm that our government is committed to working with them to further highlight the unique needs and interests of the North. “The mineral development sector is essential across the all three territories. Mining and exploration is the biggest source of private sector jobs and income for our residents and has been the heart of our economy for decades. It is imperative that we continue to support it. “I want to reassure businesses and residents that the Government of the Northwest Territories takes your concerns very seriously and is working hard to support our people. Safety is our number one priority, but next to that is ensuring that our economy remains healthy and people feel secure. “We don’t know the full impacts that this virus will have on our economy, but I do know that helping our economy rebound from COVID-19 will take time. By working together with our stakeholders, Indigenous governments, business community, and more, I am confident we will get through this and come out stronger on the other side.”  "

After careful consideration, the GNWT will not be closing liquor stores at this point in time. Although closing liquor stores seems like it would remove dangerous behaviours, research tells us that removing access to alcohol is likely to create hardship for persons already struggling with addictions and potentially increase the burden on the NWT health care system at a time when its capacity to manage potential COVID-19 cases must be maintained. The GNWT’s current approach to managing the sale of alcohol is a coordinated and reasonable approach that will continue to allow access to liquor and cannabis in the NWT.  To address potential concerns related to their operation, the Northwest Territories Liquor and Cannabis Commission and operators of the NWT’s liquor stores have made adjustments to their operating hours and sales practices to ensure that customers and staff are safe and able to practice social distancing while in the stores. The GNWT is also examining how best to implement specific changes to the Liquor Regulations that would allow for a variety of temporary adjustments to further reflect current realities and social distancing requirements.   The decision about how to manage alcohol in individual communities is one that is best made by individual communities.  There are a variety of tools already available in the Liquor Act that provide communities with the ability to make decisions about how to manage alcohol within their boundaries, including Temporary Prohibition Orders.  Quote “Our healthcare system, police and emergency first responders are working hard to address the realities created by COVID-19.  At this time, it is our job to minimize potential additional stresses on these systems.  Although on the surface it seems that closing liquor stores would remove dangerous behaviours, research tells us that removing access to alcohol during the emergency response to COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate the addiction-related health and social wellness challenges that we face throughout the territory every day.” -        Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance Quick Facts ·       There are currently 15 NWT communities that have plebiscite-approved liquor restrictions or prohibition measures reflected in enforceable regulations. ·       The GNWT is currently working with the communities of Aklavik, Tsiigehtchic, Tuktoyaktuk, and Tulita to enact temporary prohibition orders. ·       Enforcement of Liquor Act-related offences will be identified in the Minister of Justice’s Ministerial Police Priorities.

There has been much discussion around access to liquor stores and liquor products during COVID 19. I want to say to residents that the GNWT has no intention of closing liquor stores during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We have weighed the pros and cons, looked to the experience of jurisdictions across Canada and heard many different voices on this issue and have decided that removing all lawful access to alcohol would simply do more harm than good.   Not only would removing access to legal alcohol create hardships for persons already struggling with addiction, it would potentially increase the burden on our NWT health care system at a time when it must remain focussed on fighting this pandemic. Sudden and forced withdrawal for those with any level of dependence on alcohol would hae impacts on police, medical first responders and the health care system at large from mental health to physical detox impacts.  We also recognize that decisions about how to manage alcohol within a community is one that I would like encourage be made by community leadership.  The NWT Liquor Act provides a variety of tools to municipal and band governments to allow them to make decisions about what will best respond to the specific needs of their residents.  The Northwest Territories has 15 communities who, before this pandemic began, put in place some form of alcohol restriction or prohibition system.  These restriction or prohibition systems remain in effect.   Additionally, the Department of Finance has been working closely with those communities who request the enactment of a temporary prohibition order.  To date, we have received requests from four communities to put these temporary orders in place.  The option of requesting a temporary prohibition order is available to all NWT communities that do not have liquor stores or licensed establishments.   The Northwest Territories Liquor and Cannabis Commission has been in regular contact  with liquor store owners to ensure that liquor store staff and customers are able to follow the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer and practice social distancing while in the store.  We are also examining how best to implement specific changes to the Liquor Regulations that would allow us to make a variety of temporary adjustments related to the sale of liquor that will reflect our current economic realities, the impact on the hospitality industry, support the advisory for people to stay home and encourage social distancing.

As the Premier said, these are unprecedented times.  We put a name on it three weeks ago when we called a Public Health Emergency.  In declaring this emergency, we empowered the Northwest Territories Chief Public Health Officer to take the necessary extraordinary steps to meet this challenge, and protect our territory.  We’ve restricted entry in our territory, mandated self-isolation for residents returning to the NWT, and moved aggressively to educate people on behaviors they should practice and why we all must be in this together.  And to the thousands of residents across this territory who have been with us on our measures – embracing social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and changing how they live – from the bottom of my heart, thank you.  But we’re in this for the long-haul. This will be months, not weeks. And it is clear our steps must get bolder in order to meet this crisis head on.  The unfortunate reality, is that there will be a minority of people who will not walk with us. Education and awareness alone are never enough for some people.  The careless actions of this minority put our families, our friends and our communities at a higher risk.  And the compliance and enforcement taskforce will see to it - that this is not tolerated.  We’re expanding our enforcement efforts to strengthen Dr. Kandola’s orders where necessary, and protect everyone in our territory.  Our footprint will grow to encompass all 33 communities.  This taskforce will coordinate across government and other agencies as we continue to respond to this crisis.  But even with this expanded footprint, we must remember it needs to be a community effort to get the most out of our public health measures.  So today, I call on leadership across the territory to join us in building a culture of compliance in our communities.  That means making sure everyone knows you need to be in self-isolation if you’ve been tested or you’re sick.  It means reminding folks not to stand so close in the general store, and wearing cloth masks when around people. It means letting your friends know parties aren’t OK right now, and suggesting a group chat on-line instead.  It’s about telling people to wash their hands like crazy.  And it’s about making sure folks aren’t going out in big groups’ on-the-land and not keeping their distance.  In a perfect world, charges wouldn’t be necessary.  But this government will not stand down when the actions of a few, put others in danger. I strongly urge all residents to pay heed and follow Dr. Kandola’s current orders and any she may decide are needed in the days ahead, and get on the same team as we rise to this challenge together.  Thank you. "

Today we’re here to talk to media and residents about how the Government of the Northwest Territories will enforce orders made by the Chief Public Health Officer to protect NWT residents and communities.  For weeks now, responding to the impacts of COVID-19 has been the top priority for government officials all across this country and across the world.  COVID-19 is a global pandemic, a public health emergency that needs to be taken seriously.  In the Northwest Territories, we are taking this very seriously, and our decisions reflect that.  For nearly a month now, the Chief Public Health Officer has been issuing advice and direction to protect the health and safety of our residents.  During this time, returning residents have been required to self-isolate in regional centres and file self-isolation plans. All residents have also been asked to stay home, to stop planning or participating in mass gatherings, to cancel their parties and trips, and to adhere to social distancing precautions.  In a short amount of time, these measures have had a tremendous impact on our territory. I know our economy is suffering and people want to go back to work and normal life, but these measures have also proven to be successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in our territory – for now.  Now is not the time to loosen the measures set in place by the Chief Public Health Officer, but rather to emphasize their importance and be extra diligent.  This virus is a threat to the health of all NWT residents and our government is committed to taking strong action to protect our people and communities, as reflected in the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer While we expect all residents to do the responsible thing and follow the directions of Dr. Kandola, we also need to be prepared to enforce those orders when it is necessary.  The formation of the NWT Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce being announced today will strengthen the territory’s ability to enforce the measures put in place to protect the public health of all NWT residents.  We all want the same thing – to protect our families and loved ones from the threat of COVID-19. We all have to do our part, even when that means cancelling our plans and giving up our usual activities.  That may not be easy, but it is the right thing to do and I’m calling on all NWT residents to do it for the people they love. Do it for your grandparents, do it for your mom and dad, do it for your kids or your nieces and nephews.  The decisions we make now, will impact the decisions we have to make in the days and weeks that follow.  The Government of the Northwest Territories has been preparing for this pandemic for weeks now and making sure it has all the tools it needs to protect the health of our residents. The taskforce being announced today is another important tool that will ensure we are able to enforce the orders that our Chief Public Health Officer has made to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and lessen its impact on our people and communities.  I am pleased to welcome this new team and offer them my full support.  Thank you."

Earlier today I announced that I would be assuming responsibility for the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs, effective today.  The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis on a level the world has not seen in generations. Taking action to slow its spread and protect public health requires personal attention and leadership from the highest levels of government.  Around the world, we are seeing national leaders take charge of their countries’ response to COVID-19. Here in Canada the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister are leading the national response. At the provincial and territorial level, Premiers are the public face of their governments’ responses, while continuing to work hard behind the scenes to provide leadership and share plans with each other. As in other jurisdictions, the challenge COVID-19 presents to the Northwest Territories requires a coordinated team approach from Cabinet, if we are to manage it successfully. As leader of the team, I feel it is my responsibility to take a more hands-on role in managing and leading the government’s response as Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs.  Overseeing this collaborative effort is consistent with my responsibilities to provide overall management and direction to the Executive Branch of the Government of the Northwest Territories, as set out in the Executive and Indigenous Affairs Establishment Policy.  As Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, I will be responsible for providing leadership and direction to the Emergency Management Organization, which is responsible for coordinating the GNWT’s emergency management activities. In this role, I will be working closely with Associate Deputy Minister Russ Neudorf and EMO Director Ivan Russell to provide all our support to the Chief Public Health Officer and ensure the entire government is working to implement and enforce her orders to protect public health.  COVID-19 is a serious challenge to the Northwest Territories, and to the world. But it is a challenge we can meet together.  Under the leadership of the Chief Public Health Officer, our government started preparing for this weeks before the global pandemic was declared. The measures we have put in place, at the direction of Dr. Kandola, have been put in place to protect our residents and our communities. We cannot prevent COVID-19 from coming to our territory and our communities, but we must all play a role in slowing its spread and managing its impact on our people.  We all must follow the direction of Dr. Kandola to stay home, avoid unnecessary outings, and stay connected online or by telephone while maintaining physical distance. Whether we are sick or healthy, we need to wash our hands, avoid touching our faces and cough into our elbows.  These are simple actions, but these are the actions that will help protect our friends and our loved ones, especially those who are most vulnerable. In the south we are seeing the devastating consequences of what happens when people choose not to take precautions. I want to reiterate that responding to COVID-19 is a team effort and will require the full effort of every Minister and every department. Each Minister will continue to be responsible for doing their part to help us all combat COVID-19 and I continue to have confidence in our whole team.  Thank you. I’ll open the floor to questions now. "

She is an expert in protecting public health and the decisions she is making are going to protect NWT residents in both large and small communities.  I understand that people are very concerned about their health and safety. The GNWT is very concerned too. That is why we have taken the steps we have to protect residents over the past three weeks.  And although we have seen an increase in COVID cases this week, we can’t forget this important fact: that the measures to protect all our communities worked.   All four individuals isolated at home and followed the direction of our Chief Public Health Officer.  Because of this, we were able to make sure the communities were not put at risk and contact was minimal.  The plans we made to treat individuals with COVID-19 were put into action and we were able to offer testing and treatment that met the needs of each individual, safely -- without creating risk for the communities or anybody in them.  What we’ve seen across the globe is that this virus doesn’t care who you are, or where you’re from. It doesn’t know town limits, and it doesn’t know boundaries.  For that reason, if we’re acting differently simply because a virus is in a particular community, we are not doing our job properly.  The only way we can slow the spread is by getting ahead of it. And the only way we get ahead of it, is by acting like we all have it, and changing our behaviours 100 percent of the time.  We all need to support the work of Dr. Kandola and follow her direction. Her advice is for everybody. It is not just for sick people and it is not just for communities where we know the virus is.  The only way we can slow the spread of this virus and protect our families and communities is for everybody to do what the Chief Public Health Officer says. Stop social gatherings, don’t go anywhere you don’t need to, practice social distancing at all time, wash your hands frequently, and follow healthy respiratory practices. These are the best tools we have to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. I can’t stress this enough -- we all have to do this. We can’t be lazy about it and we can’t cut corners because we haven’t heard about cases in our communities. These are rules for everybody. These are the rules that will keep us safe. So we must be courageous. We must trust our medical professionals. We must be kind and compassionate toward each other. And most importantly, we must work together to slow the spread of this virus. "

Once again, we have some unhappy news that we’re here to discuss: the confirmation of two additional COVID-19 cases in the Northwest Territories, including our first case in a small community.  I know that people are concerned for their health, especially the people in small communities.  I also know that people are concerned to know if COVID-19 is in your community.  I hear that concern and I respect it, but I want to reassure all residents – whatever community they live in – that the Government of the Northwest Territories is doing everything possible to protect you from COVID-19.  Knowing what communities COVID-19 is in will not make you safer. What makes you safer is respecting the orders the Chief Public Health Officer has given to help keep all NWT residents safe. This does not mean we can stop COVID-19 from entering the territory or from reaching small communities.  But it does mean that we can make sure that we have the right measures in place to slow the spread in whatever community it is in.  And it does mean that we have plans to provide safe and appropriate treatment to those people who need it, regardless of where in the NWT you are located.  The measures that Dr. Kandola has implemented – especially the direction for travellers and people with symptoms to self-isolate – are the measures that will keep COVID-19 from spreading to our people.  And when people do get sick, our health and social services system and the people who work in it are ready to provide the care that those people need…safely, and without creating additional risk for the patient, the community or our staff.  I want to thank and acknowledge these people who are putting themselves at the service of all residents of the NWT right now.  We are all disappointed that COVID-19 has been discovered in more communities this week, but we should not be surprised by that fact. COVID-19 is everywhere in the world, it is here in Canada, and it is here in the Northwest Territories.  But we do not have to be discouraged by that. We have been preparing for weeks in the NWT and we know what we have to do to help flatten the curve and slow the spread in our communities.  We need everyone – everyone – to follow the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer. Be vigilant on behalf of yourselves and your loved ones. Stay home, maintain physical distance, but stay connected and support each other online or by telephone. We need to be on top of hand washing, cough into our elbows and do our best to not touch our faces.  To all people who have fallen ill this week I want to say that our thoughts are with you, and I wish you well. "
326,2020-04-03,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/leaders-north-slave-region-issue-statement-illegal-harvest-bathurst-caribou,Government Website,Leaders from the North Slave Region Issue Statement on Illegal Harvest of Bathurst Caribou,"The Minister of Environment and Natural Resources (ENR), Shane Thompson, together with Tłı̨chǫ Grand Chief George Mackenzie, Łutsel Kʼe Dene First Nation Chief Darryl Marlowe, and other Indigenous regional leaders, issued a joint statement today to reinforce the need for responsible harvesting of caribou in this time of rapid herd decline: ENR officers determined that more than 80 caribou were killed illegally within the Mobile Core Bathurst Caribou Management Zone over the past two weeks. Wasted meat and parts from 12 more caribou were also discovered outside the zone last weekend. “Working together, the decision was made to close the harvest of Bathurst caribou and put in place a mobile no-hunting zone to protect the herd,” said the leaders. “Hunters should not be harvesting in this zone, given the fragile state of the Bathurst herd.” “It is also disappointing to see animals being wasted in this way. This behaviour is not only disrespectful—it is illegal.” The Bathurst caribou herd has declined by 98 per cent since 1986. Only 8,200 caribou remain. The Mobile Zone was put in place in 2015 to protect the herd. No hunting is allowed inside this zone. ENR officers seized meat and issued tickets to hunters caught over the weekend. Prior to March 21, there had only been one case of harvesting in the mobile zone this winter. Leaders also expressed concern about the health and safety of hunters. People across the Northwest Territories are currently being asked to practice social distancing and avoid close contact to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This virus is especially dangerous for elders in small and isolated communities. Over the weekend, hunters along the winter road were observed travelling and gathering and visiting in groups. This behaviour goes against the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer, who supports people going out on the land, but only with their immediate family or people they live with. “We understand this is a difficult and uncertain time for everyone,” said Minister Thompson. “It is up to all of us to ensure we are making good decisions to protect the health and safety of our communities and the future of our caribou. There are other animals that can be legally harvested at this time, including moose, muskox, fish, small game and other caribou herds. We encourage people to look at other options, and to harvest other animals respectfully and sustainably.” ENR will continue to actively monitor the Mobile Zone through daily air and ground patrols and enforce the no-hunting rule to protect the Bathurst caribou herd."

This extension is due to the continued need for response to the COVID-19 global pandemic to protect public health in the Northwest Territories. The Public Health Emergency was extended upon the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola. The declaration of a Public Health Emergency allows the Chief Public Health Officer to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic. Since the first emergency was declared, Dr. Kandola has instituted strict travel prohibitions for non-residents with limited exceptions. Dr. Kandola’s focus continues to be on controlling the spread over the next 60 days. With two cases now confirmed, the need to continue to follow Dr. Kandola’s orders and recommendations is even more urgent. All residents must come together to embrace social distancing by canceling parties, funerals, and other gatherings; keep at least two metres between themselves and others, and wash their hands frequently to slow the spread of the virus. Under the Act, Public Health Emergencies may last up to 14 days. However, if the risk to public health remains, the Minister may extend a Public Health Emergency, as often as necessary, by a maximum of 14 days for each extension. Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably within Canada."

Just before this press conference, I was informed we have confirmed a second case of COVID-19 in the NWT.  We issued a Public Health Advisory as soon as the patient was notified, and we had enough facts to communicate to the public.  We apologize about the late notice, and we understand this would ideally have been done in person.  In the spirit of transparency and immediacy our residents expect, it was essential we put this out as soon as possible. And there was simply no time to arrange a change in format.  Some details on this second case. The individual is self-isolated in their home in Inuvik along with members of their household. They are doing well with mild symptoms and it is not expected hospitalization will be required.  Our investigation determines the individual traveled to British Columbia. They returned to Inuvik on March 21 and went into immediate self-isolation  consistent with our order.  They developed symptoms five days after their return and showed no symptoms during their flight back.  The entire household has been under mandatory isolation along with them since March 21. This strict adherence to our orders on isolation is an example all residents in our territory should follow.  We will be continuing our investigation to identify whether there are any further contacts.  Some updates on testing and investigations.  Currently in the Northwest Territories, we have completed 979 tests, with two confirmed cases.    Our contact tracing indicates all tracked contacts of our first confirmed case have tested negative. This is good news, and a reminder of what a difference social distancing can make.  These are measures we must maintain for the foreseeable future.  To that end, I have recommended to the Minister, and she has signed an order, extending the Public Health Emergency for a further 14 days – the maximum amount it can be extended each time.  I would like to remind all residents that the Health and Social Services Website is the source for truthful information on the progression of COVID-19.  My promise to residents is that this information will be updated daily, and that we will notify residents of any new cases once the appropriate patient notification is complete.  And I would like to remind residents that rumors damage our response.  Your friend from town does not have better information than our public health professionals.  And when we spend time investigating these rumors because we have a mandate to make sure, we are taking time away from our response.  I would now like to comment on some prevention concerns.  We are receiving reports of community funerals and other gatherings continuing to take place in spite of our advice to cancel all gatherings.   These are events where a lot of people get together. They often attract elders, who are more at risk of serious complications and death from COVID-19.  And it’s not just funerals. Bringing people together physically from outside of your regular household is one of the quickest ways to spread the virus and hurt our communities – and it doesn’t matter where it is. Weddings, feasts, weekends at the cabin, any time you have more than those then those that live in your household close to you – we all need to avoid this.  We understand this is very difficult time with a lot of change in how we interact. We need to make some tough decisions, and get creative to protect each other, our elders and our most vulnerable.  But we can’t let being separate in space divide us in spirit. This is the time to strengthen our connections with our family, connect with those in your household by playing games, cooking together, building forts, learning how to play and learning how to listen.  For family and friends outside your household, keep connected from afar.  For communities, share your spirit with vehicle parades or teddy bears hunts, open window drum dances or social media sharing, prayer trees or set times everyone does something together in their own space.  Another concern we have is reports from the RCMP about crowded house and apartment parties taking place in communities around the territory.  This is not the time for a party – and if you’re organizing them, you’re bringing unnecessary danger to your community.  If you’re young and healthy, you may not even notice that you have the virus. But you can still spread it to people who can get really sick – your parents, your grandparents, other members of your community that you know and love.  We encourage you to try creative ways to stay close to your friends without being in the same place. Try a group chat, or stay in touch on social media. If you have a good internet connection, Google offers free video conferencing so you can see each other.  I also want to also touch upon our enforcement efforts.  Since setting up the Protect NWT self-isolation planning and compliance line, we have received 85 complaints related to compliance.  We have closed 58 after taking the necessary corrective actions, like warnings and education measures.  10 have been closed due to non-actionable information.  16 investigations are now underway.  We will always aim to educate first, and take additional action only when necessary.  But if we find people aren’t following the orders, nothing is off-the-table in finding ways to increase compliance. I want to remind residents that no one is immune from this virus.  We know from stories around the globe that whether you’re a 25 year-old marathon runner, or a pensioner, this virus can get you.  And even if you don’t get very sick, you can be an unknowing spreader of this virus, and hurt people you care about.   In short, we’re in this together. And it’s important we keep our solidarity as we work to limit the spread.  So stay socially connected, while keeping physically distant.  Help your communities however you can. And be kind to each other.  As long as we’re united, I know we’ll get through this – together. "

The last time we were here, when we discussed the roll out of the first wave of financial relief the GNWT put together in response to COVID 19, I said that we would continue to look for opportunities to be creative in the delivery of government services.   I am pleased to be here again with you today to introduce a second wave of financial relief measures our government has identified to keep or put money in the hands of residents and businesses as we all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID 19. First, I would like to talk about some changes to the Income Assistance Program. Minister Simpson and his team have identified a series of immediate changes that will help support some of our most financially vulnerable citizens.  Today, we are introducing a one-time emergency allowance for income assistance recipients that will provide $500 to single recipients, and $1000 to households with two or more people to ensure that they have appropriate cleaning supplies, and are prepared for a 14 day period of self-isolation. We are also be providing additional benefits to Income Assistance clients by excluding ‘gifts and unearned income’ from the calculation of earned income until June 30, 2020. This change will ensure that income assistance clients are able to keep whatever money they are given or earn over the next several months. Next, Minister Chinna and her team at the NWTHC have identified $5 million dollars to support the immediate need to provide housing to people who are homeless or have housing instability so that they can self-isolate. $1.4 million of this funding will support the development of 36 housing units at the Aspen apartments and 25 units at the Arnica Inn; while $3.6 million will be directed to renovating 130 units in communities across the NWT. These units will ensure that individuals have somewhere safe to stay right away if they need to self-isolate and will help to reduce the risk of spreading Covid-19 associated with overcrowded and instable housing. We are also announcing several sector specific initiatives today, including: Health and Social Services is waiving professional fees for medical professionals in the territory; The GNWT will waive interest charges on all late tax returns between March 15 and June 30 including fuel tax and payroll tax; and In support of our restaurant and hospitality industry, the NWTLCC will offer to buy back any unopened alcohol stock, ensuring that businesses have access to the cash they need now. Together with the initiatives being announced by Minister Nokleby, this second wave of financial relief in response to the COVID 19 pandemic is the next step in our work to support northerners and is valued at approximately $8.259 million. These initiatives are to be implemented immediately.   This adds to the initial financial responses announced earlier this month for a combined total value of approximately $21.459 million in GNWT financial relief to COVID-19. As I said the last time, we will continue our work to support the people, businesses and communities of the Northwest Territories.  Our Premier and every Cabinet Minister have regular calls with our Federal, Provincial and Territorial counterparts where we share ideas and initiatives that we are undertaking here in the NWT, as well as thoughts and ideas on how to make the Federal programs as effective as possible for each region’s particular challenges; including, for example, the funding provided to Indigenous governments to support on the land activities. There is no doubt that we will need to continue to work closely with our Federal colleagues as we analyze and ultimately respond to the full financial impacts of COVID in the coming weeks and months.  We will also continue our financial response efforts at home. Several departments are already looking at what areas will require legislative or regulatory change in order to provide further relief for challenges created by the pandemic response. The Department of Finance continues to work with all departments to identify any areas where cost relief can be offered or existing financial supports made more flexible. Our unwavering goal is first and foremost to ensure the physical health of the people of the NWT by limiting the spread of COVID 19 but then also to ensure the mental, social and financial wellbeing of the NWT. We all remain committed to a whole of government response that will achieve these goals. "

Over the past 2 weeks, the situation with COVID-19 has evolved at a pace that none of us could have predicted, and each day brings with it new challenges.  We all know that COVID-19 has very quickly had a significant impact on the Northwest Territories economy, and our government is committed to continuing to put supports in place to help businesses and individuals through this difficult time.  Just over a week ago, Minister Wawzonek and I announced $13.2 Million dollars in Government of the Northwest Territories supports for our residents.  Today we’re back to announce an additional $8.259 million, bringing the total value to $21.459 million in Government of the Northwest Territories COVID-19 support announced to date.  As Minister Wawzonek outlined, supports included in the announcement today range from Income Assistance increases, to Emergency Housing funds.  Aviation is another area touched on in this wave of supports. This sector, a critical piece of our territorial supply chain, has been especially impacted by COVID-19. That is why, including the aircraft landing fees already waived, almost $1 million in GNWT financial relief will also be provided to help support critical aviation businesses that our communities and economy rely upon. Ministers have been meeting regularly, and continue to work with our departments to ensure there is a plan that includes using COVID relief efforts to keep northern and indigenous businesses afloat. Examples such as utilizing northern companies to ensure the supply chain remains intact or to provide Personal Protective equipment, services for decontamination, or safety training.  We are also looking at ways to utilize key infrastructure projects to ensure the construction and consulting sectors are sustained, and that projects critical to our territory, such as long term care facilities, continue to advance. Departments have been working extremely hard to make sure that project execution remains a focus, while also doing their part to ensure that the precautionary health measures put in place to protect the spread of COVID-19 across our territory are adhered to. As the Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment, it is part of my job to safeguard our economy, and I want to reassure each resident that I am focused during this time on ensuring minimal impacts to the economy.  I know residents are worried and I continue to hear concerns from people who have lost business revenue, or employment because of COVID-19.  Concerns over mine closures are another big discussion right now. Our mines and other resource project operators, like all Northwest Territories’ business, are making tough decisions in the interest of the health and wellbeing of their employees, clients, and residents of the NWT. They are also being forced to make difficult decisions about their futures.  All major resource projects are different: in their ownership structures, their operations, and their workforces. These differences directly affect how they go about implementing COVID-19 response plans.  We are supportive of the mines and operations that are prepared to operate safely as long as they can. I can assure the public that the mines are working directly with the Worker’s Safety and Compensation Commission and the Chief Public Health Office to identify a way for them to continue to operate that protects the safety of our residents. We’re going to see economic impacts of Covid-19 over a range of sectors, but how we react, and the proactive measures we put in place as we face these challenges, will ultimately determine how we are impacted by them.   The supports announced today will help, but are only part of the equation.   In the days and weeks that follow, the GNWT will continue to find other ways to support our residents and communities.  We will also continue to work with the Government of Canada and our federal ministerial counterparts to draw their attention to the unique needs of the north and northern businesses. Over the last several weeks I, and my colleagues, have participated in numerous national level calls where we continue to be a strong voice, ensuring that federal relief and recovery programs are relevant and applicable to our unique northern environment.  Together, we will get through this and demonstrate to the world that strong northern resiliency that will help us to come out of this time even stronger. Thank you.   "

The Northwest Territories Association of Communities (NWTAC), Music NWT, and the GNWT have teamed up to run these campaigns. Our goal is to build solidarity during the COVID-19 crisis, and get residents to recognize that changing behaviors isn’t just about them – it’s about the people they love, and our most vulnerable community-members. Protect Our Elders: A Community Campaign To Stop The Spread Of COVID-19 This social media campaign encourages NWT residents to share the message that the kindest thing we can do to protect our Elders, and keep our loved ones safe, is to stay home and keep at least 2 meters away from people outside our homes. Community members are encouraged to snap a selfie and submit it (& share it on your social media!) for your messages to be shared along with those of other northerners. Together, we can send a message loud and clear to everyone in the NWT that NOW is the time to be physically apart, so that we can come together with our Elders in good health again soon. Protect Our Elders: Radio Ad Writing Competition This campaign invites you to record your own radio ad that encourages everyone to protect our elders and loved ones by keeping two metres apart, practice good hygiene, and do their part by self-isolating as much as possible. It can be a song, a story, a touching PSA – the door is wide open and thinking outside the box is encouraged. And don’t think you need a professional recording rig – recording on your phone is good enough. Music NWT is offering cash prizes for the top entries, as well as an honourable mention for ads that really hit home. The winning ads will be played on NWT radio! Quick Facts While anyone can catch it, elders, those who have compromised immune systems, and those who have had diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart or lung disease are most at-risk of catching, and getting very sick from COVID-19.

Take This Online Self-Assessment For COVID-19 In The Northwest Territories,"The GNWT’s online self-assessment tool for COVID-19 for residents has been completed nearly 2500 times after launching just days ago. The tool will help assess any symptoms, travel history, and other variables to help you know what you should do to protect yourself and your community. You can complete it for yourself, or you can complete it for someone else. The tool collects no personal information. Based on the outcome, the assessment tool will give residents information on what they should do next. The tool will let you know if you should be contacting a local health care centre by phone to arrange testing, or if symptoms are severe enough that you should call for emergency help. The objectives of providing this tool are two-fold: Give residents peace of mind and clear direction based on their situation, and Reduce strain on call-in operations and frontline health workers to better serve people across the Northwest Territories. All residents who can use this tool, or can get help using it, are urged to use the self-assessment tool to help us reach these objectives. Printed versions of the self-assessment are being distributed to health care centres. Anyone using a self-assessment tool should be aware of what assessment tool they are using. There are many online self-assessment tools available from the federal government and other provinces which do not reflect the Northwest Territories’ aggressive testing strategy. To get the appropriate information and guidance within the NWT, residents are encouraged to only use the NWT’s online-self assessment tool. If a person is experiencing severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, call 9-1-1 and do not proceed with the self-assessment tool.    "

This week, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs Paulie Chinna exercised her authority under the Emergency Management Act and declared a state of emergency for the Northwest Territories.  I want to emphasize and reassure NWT residents that this step was not taken because the risk of COVID-19 to the NWT has increased or that the situation is worse than before. It is not.  The Northwest Territories still has only one confirmed case of COVID-19 and our government has taken swift action to restrict travel into the NWT and set up self-isolation facilities for returning NWT residents in regional centres.  The main reason for this decision was to make sure that the Emergency Management Organization – or EMO – has all the tools it needs to implement the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.  This declaration is all about making sure that our officials who are working night and day to support the Chief Public Health Officer and slow the spread of COVID-19 have all the resources and authority they need to do their jobs.  Last week, when Minister Thom, Dr. Kandola, and I spoke to media about the NWT’s first and only confirmed case of COVID-19, we promised to take strong action to protect the people of the Northwest Territories. That is what this decision is – strong action.  I have spoken at length with Minister Chinna about this decision. She is working remotely from her home in Norman Wells and was unable to join us for this news conference, but will be available to media this afternoon.  I want to let people know that the Minister has not taken this step lightly. She has given a lot of thought to the needs of the entire territory and she wants to make sure that she has done everything in her power to help the Chief Public Health Officer and our staff slow the spread of COVID-19.  In closing, I want to assure the people of the Northwest Territories that their government is putting everything it has into slowing the spread of COVID-19 and reducing its impact on our communities.  All Ministers and Departments are committed to this fight and we are working day and night to protect our people and our communities, along with our community and Indigenous government partners, and our partners in the federal and provincial governments.  We know we face challenges, but Northerners are tough, resilient people and I am confident that we can meet that challenge together.  By all of us working together, we will be able to address this pandemic.  Once again, I would like to remind the public to follow the health and safety precautions:  Wash your hands frequently;  Keep your physical distance from people to 2 metres;  Stay home as much as possible, especially if you’re sick;  Follow the procedures outlined on the Health and Social Services website if you are unwell and have flu-like symptoms;  And don’t forget to keeping talking to your friends and neighbours via social media or calling.  Together, we will get through this.  I would now like to turn it over to EMO Director Ivan Russell to explain some of the details of this declaration. "

Simpson met with Northwest Territories (NWT) Education Leaders and the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) via teleconference on Tuesday, March 24 to discuss the status of JK-12 education in the territory as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency. Education Leaders included Chairs of the Tłı̨chǫ Community Services Agency, Dettah and Ndilo District Education Authorities (DEAs), the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, Beaufort Delta Education Council, Dehcho Divisional Education Council, South Slave Divisional Education Council, Sahtu Divisional Education Council, Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic Schools, as well as NWTTA President. Due to the significant health concerns posed by COVID-19 and the importance of following direction from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) on social distancing as a way to keep students, staff and communities safe, Education Leaders have agreed with the recommendation from Minister Simpson that schools be closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. Education Leaders have shared the recommendation with District Education Authorities, who hold the authority under the Education Act to close NWT schools. Closures are being announced individually by respective education councils. Minister Simpson, Education Leaders and the NWTTA recognize the serious impact school closures will have on students, parents, staff and communities, and have agreed that a plan is required to support continued learning for all students, especially those in Grade 12, to achieve their education and career goals.  ECE continues to meet daily with NWT education superintendents and the NWTTA to discuss support for essential services, continuity of educational programming and ongoing communication. These plans continue to be adjusted as new information and direction is provided by the CPHO. While the immediate priority is not to provide lessons or give instruction it is necessary to identify and secure essential services for supporting students and communities. All parties share the strong interest of parents and communities in ensuring opportunities for continued learning. The NWTTA has advised that teachers are prepared and willing to help students and communities however they can during this unprecedented time. ECE will continue to work with the NWTTA and education bodies to find options for providing educational programming to all NWT students, particularly those in Grade 12. This includes reviewing what’s being done in other jurisdictions, especially Alberta,  whose curriculum and major assessment tools are used for the majority of NWT education programming. ECE will also be working to coordinate with post-secondary institutions across Canada in an effort to ensure the smoothest transition possible for those graduating this year. Minister Simpson continues to have weekly calls with Canadian Education Ministers to discuss ways to ensure students graduating high school this year are able to advance to post-secondary institutions. The continuation of meal programs, along with counselling and other health and wellness programming, have been identified by ECE, the CPHO and education bodies as essential to NWT communities, and work is ongoing to identify which positions and individuals will be involved in providing these programs and services during school closures.  ECE will continue to provide updates to parents, communities and education bodies as plans are developed and implemented.    Quote: “The COVID-19 situation in the Northwest Territories has evolved substantially since the initial closure of schools on March 16. As new public health advisories and orders are put in place, including the declaration of a public health emergency, the closure of the NWT border and the cancellation of all gatherings, we must continue to make difficult decisions to protect the health and safety of our residents. I am grateful to the NWT Education Leaders for their dedication and commitment to ensuring the well-being of our students, staff and communities in deciding to close schools for the remainder of the school year. As Minister, I remain committed to working with our education bodies to provide students and communities with the programs and services they need to succeed throughout this unprecedented time.”  - Hon. R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment  						Quick Facts: The Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) of the NWT made the recommendation that schools remain closed until after Easter Break as a precautionary measure to minimize the potential spread of COVID-19.  On March 21, the CPHO issued an order to close the border and require all NWT residents returning from outside the territory to self-isolate for 14 days. This current order from the CPHO applies to all school staff and students returning from travel. A significant number of school employees were out of the territory on spring break when these travel restrictions were ordered, and are therefore currently self-isolating. ECE and education bodies continue to work together on continuity planning in relation to JK-12 class cancellation. All options for continued provision of educational services, including potential alternative learning plans, are currently being explored.   Links: COVID-19 Information (HSS) Information on JK-12 Schools (ECE) 							  							Media Inquiries: 							Press Secretary  							Cabinet Communications 							Government of the Northwest Territories 							Email:  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

Today, our territory confirmed its first case of COVID-19.  First of all, I’d like to echo Premier Cochrane’s message of support to those affected.  These things are hard — for the individuals who contract the virus, for friends, for families, and for our communities.  Our thoughts are with you. And so too are our actions.  And to that end, NWT Chief Public Health Officer Dr. KamI Kandola has issued an order prohibiting entry of non-residents to the Northwest Territories by land, air, or port with limited exceptions, and requiring by order that all returning residents must self-isolate in Yellowknife, Fort Smith, Hay River, or Inuvik.  These measures are drastic. They will be challenging. But they are necessary.  This government is dedicating all available resources to pushing back the spread of this virus.  We’re testing at a rate double that of Canada’s as-a-whole so we can trace and respond to infection quickly.  We’re marshalling all available resources to bolster our healthcare response.  And no option is off-the-table as we move forward. I want to send a strong message to communities across the Northwest Territories today.  The threat COVID-19 poses to our territory is real.  And the challenges we now face are significant. We must strictly follow the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer as she works to respond to this crisis.  And if you don’t, you are hurting our communities, and hampering our response.  We’re all in this together. It is on all of us to do our part. And I have confidence today, with the leadership and expertise of Dr. Kandola, and the strength of our communities, that we can band together, help each other, and change our lifestyles to combat COVID-19.  I will now pass it off to Dr. Kami Kandola to provide more details. "

Late last night our public health officials confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories.    This is hard news to share and I want to express my concern and sympathy for the people affected by this and let them know that the Government of the Northwest Territories is going to do everything we can to support them in this difficult time.    To the people of the Northwest Territories, I want to say that we knew this day would come and the GNWT has been working hard so that we would be prepared when it did.    We know there are simple and effective steps that we can all take to help slow down and limit the spread of this virus in our communities.    Slowing the spread will give our medical officials like Dr. Kandola the time they need to keep planning and managing our response so we can help protect residents and communities.    Slowing the spread will also ensure our health care system is not flooded with a large wave of sick people all at once. This will be crucial to maintaining our capacity to care for and treat the people who do get sick.    This is why the Government of the Northwest Territories began its own preparations weeks before a pandemic was declared, and this has enabled us to take the right measures to respond to COVID-19.    We have taken strong actions to prepare already and we are going to continue to take strong action to protect all our residents.    This confirmed case is being investigated thoroughly. We are in the process tracing contacts and doing everything in our capacity to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the NWT.  We want to reassure the public that we are taking all appropriate measures to keep the residents and communities of the NWT safe. Efforts that began weeks ago will continue as we move forward with these challenges.  I commend the healthcare providers and front line service staff across the NWT for their commitment and dedication to keeping residents of the NWT safe.   I also want to thank the many businesses who have stepped up to help keep our supply chains flowing such as grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations.  I want to thank those who have helped to ensure food is being delivered to our elderly and homeless and who have gone out of their way to help others in our communities.  I also want to remind everyone that we need to work together if we are going to combat this.  The best chance we have to make a difference is to follow the advice of the Chief Public Health officer.   If you are sick, stay home. Continue to practice social distancing and wash your hands.   By all of us working together, we will make a difference in how COVID-19 impacts our own families, our neighbours and all residents of the NWT.  I will now hand this over to the Minister of Health, Diane Thom."

Today, Minister Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance and Minister Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment, and Infrastructure, announced Economic Relief Measures that will help minimize expenses and keep cash available for immediate needs in this time of uncertainty. The GNWT has put together an initial economic relief package valued at $13.2 Million dollars that will take effect immediately. This package is intended to work in concert with federal incentives under Canada’s $27 billion COVID-19 Economic Response Plan announced earlier this week.  In addition to this first wave of economic relief announced today by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Industry Tourism and Investment and Infrastructure, the GNWT will continue to identify other relief measures to assist territorial residents and business owners and operators as we respond toCOVID-19. Quotes “The GNWT has been able to identify immediate steps we can take to waive fees, ease funding restrictions, and defer payments in order to reduce economic stress on territorial residents and businesses. This is not a time for anyone to worry about bills or payments. Right now we want to ensure that business who provide public services can do so safely and that employees who can stay home do so without worrying about economics. By working together we stand the best chance of reducing the potential for COVID-19 infections in the NWT.”  - Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance “We recognize that this is a difficult time for business owners and service providers in the Northwest Territories. In the short term, we will provide necessary financing to small businesses to the extent that we can. In the long term, we will work with the business community to identify a path forward to economic recovery.   We are going to need help from the federal government and we will continue to be a voice for Northwest Territories’ business in discussions addressing the costs and challenges that we are experiencing. In the meantime, I urge residents to do what they can to support local business and service providers.” - Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment and Infrastructure Quick Facts Immediate GNWT Response Measures 	Fee Reduction  	Provide relief to northern supply chain businesses through a removal of fees until the end of June for: Deh Cho Bridge tolls Truck permits Airport landing fees BDIC - Working Capital Loans Offer low interest loans to businesses to help offset up to one month of COVID-19 impacts.

The situation with COVID-19 is evolving quickly, and in times like this, what many people want most are answers. They want to know that their physical, and financial wellbeing are being looked out for. That their governments understand these pressures, and are doing everything they can.  Well, I am here today with Minister Wawzonek to try to ease some of that worry, and reassure you that there are many hardworking, dedicated people working tirelessly to deal with each issue that arises, and protect NWT residents during this uncertain time.   There is no denying that COVID-19 is a significant challenge around the world, and in the Northwest Territories.  In the North, the global situation will have an immense impact on us. There is no avoiding the economic impacts that we are already challenged with, but we are committed to doing what we can to help residents, businesses, and our economy during this period of uncertainty. As Minister Wawzonek has outlined, the GNWT has put together an initial $13.2 Million dollar economic relief package that will take effect immediately. This funding is intended to work in concert with federal incentives announced under Canada’s $27 billion COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, earlier this week. We understand the critical importance of maintaining the northern supply chain. The delivery of essential goods must continue in order to resupply our communities, and support our economy. To help maintain ground-based resupply into the territory, all toll fees for crossing the Deh Cho Bridge and many permit fees for transport trucks on all NWT highways will be waived until June. To support our airlines, all landing fees at all NWT airports will also be waived. At the BDIC, we’re going to offer low interest loans to businesses to help offset COVID-19 impacts, and allow the deferral of any BDIC loan payments for a period of up to three months with no penalty or additional interest charges. As well, we’ll offer an extension of the due date for Employer Assessment Payments with the WSCC from April 1 to May 1, 2020. We will also establish an Economic Council to help identify the economic impacts, represent the business community, and ensure that the items most critical to local economies and jobs are addressed.  There are a number of other items being implemented, and the full list of GNWT response measures for phase 1, are included in the release.   I want to reassure residents and our business community that we will continue to look at ways to support you and continue to assess other relief measures, including leaning on the federal government to offer more support to the North. The Premier and each member of Cabinet will continue to be a voice for our residents and businesses in conversations with our federal counterparts. Addressing the costs, and challenges that we are all experiencing is a priority, and we are committed to keeping you informed along the way.  Before I conclude my statement, I’d like to take a moment to address the concerns about the NWT Diamond Mines, and the decision made by Dominion Diamond Mine to temporarily suspend operations at Ekati, in the interest of mitigating the spread of COVID-19 to the NWT. This is obviously difficult news to take from the perspective of the NWT economy, and the livelihoods of those that are reliant on Ekati for jobs or business.  We know that the impacts of COVID-19 are far reaching and that includes our mining industry. That said, all mines are not equal. Their ownership structure, operations, and their capacity to address issues like COVID-19 is different. The Diavik and Gacho Kué mines, and other businesses, are also taking steps to address the COVID19 crisis. The fact that they are still operating should not be a reflection of a disregard for what is happening. I am confident that businesses that are still in operation are adhering to the safety precautions outlined by the Chief Public Health Officer, and are operating within the parameters that have been put in place so far. I want to reassure businesses and residents who depend on the mines that the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment has been in regular communication with our mines, and advanced projects on COVID-19 contingency planning efforts. The mines and industry have agreed to keep us informed, and I am committed to sharing updates and information on that, and other important matters, as I am able to do so."

Eight days ago the full Assembly came together, took stock of the growing risks of the COVID-19 pandemic and took action by deciding to end our winter session early. This past Monday, all 19 members of the Assembly supported the passage of an interim appropriation to provide a temporary budget for the functioning of the Government of the NWT until we can reconvene at the end of May.  The use of an interim appropriation might was the first step in our financial response to COVID-19. Those initial steps and further items are what I am going to outline briefly today. In these last few days, we have identified several other initiatives that we can take immediately to help support the financial health of our residents and businesses. What we are describing today is only phase 1. This has been a whole-of government effort including FIN, INF, ITI, ECE, MACA, NTPC and the WSCC. We are all working together to identify ways to help put money in the hands of people who need it for groceries,  and businesses who are trying to keep their payroll going.  This spirit of everyone working together applies to the private sector as well. There are many businesses continuing to provide services: plumbers and mechanics, drive through restaurants, grocers, water and sewage trucks, and supply chain transport and logistics. I believe they are all doing their best to follow the advice of the CPHO while also working hard to keep our communities running. I also want to acknowledge efforts from different sectors to at least temporarily reduce or remove fees, including the ongoing ask from NWTel to the CRTC. I want to encourage everyone to keep being creative and thinking of others during these unprecedented events.  With that, I want to describe this first wave of initiatives that provide an equivalent of at least $13.2m worth of financial supports to the NWT in response to COVID-19:  Interim appropriation budget:  HSS extra 25%: we want our health professionals to know, you are there for all of us and we will be supporting you  		615k for dialysis expansion in HR; expansion of regional health services and immediately, that means an injection of 615k to the HSS budget   ECE extra 25%, now set $2m for IA expecting a growth in demand and need; short term is going to be hard, we know that, and we have planned for it  100% almost all dept’s grants and contribution funding ready to go out April 1 		IGs, Community governments and NGOS will have access to their full 12 months worth of funding upfront on April 1   100% of almost all contracting available for departments to commit as of April 1  		Departments can commit to all of our business and community partners relying on the full 12 months worth of funds   Additional initiatives:  We will allow carry overs for all 2019-2020 contributions  		IGs, CG and NGOs with money in their 2019-20 budgets can continue to use those funds for their ongoing operations   advance royalty payments to devolution signatory Indigenous Governments  		Usually the payment is made in July once the previous year’s royalties are fully reported  Advance 50% of the anticipated royalties from 2019-2020 now  IGs can provide their own direct support to their people and communities   NTPC will remove load limiters and pause collections  Similarly, FIN will also be temporarily pausing collections owed to the GNWT such as payroll tax and ECE will defer all Student Financial Assistance payments until September 30  Next steps  Need to continue to support our most vulnerable  No one should worry about food, mortgages, heat or other basic needs  We will make sure that the Federal financial measures are accessible across communities  And we will look at what further supports GNWT can provide while we all navigate the realities of a global pandemic  We also have our eyes on the hopefully not too distant future and what kinds of steps we will need to take once the wave has crested  As I said in my budget speech last month, this government is going to be creative and collaborative in order to find solutions that are responsive and responsible  That has not changed. If anything, this is our opportunity to put those promises into action.  "

357,2020-03-18,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/news-release-public-health-emergency-declared-northwest-territories,Government Website,News Release: Public Health Emergency Declared in the Northwest Territories,"As of 12:00pm today, the Minister of Health and Social Services, Diane Thom, has declared a territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories Public Health Act in response to  the COVID-19 global pandemic to protect public health in the Northwest Territories.  The Public Health Emergency was declared upon the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola, and is in effect from March 18 through April 1.  The purpose of calling an emergency is to allow the Chief Public Health Officer to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily-evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic.  At this time, Dr. Kandola is focusing efforts on controlling the spread over the next 60 days. This is the most crucial period as the territory works to slow spread, flatten the curve, and keep our residents safe.  The public health emergency covers the entirety of the Northwest Territories and will provide expanded powers to the Chief Public Health Officer to: authorize qualified people to provide additional aid and services as needed; expedite emergency licensing of additional health care providers; make orders and provide directions restricting or prohibiting travel to or from any area within the Northwest Territories; coordinate and provide for the delivery of medical services; procure and provide for the distribution of medical supplies and equipment across the NWT;  Under the Act, Public Health Emergencies may last up-to 14 days. However, if the risk to public health remains, the Minister may re-declare a Public Health Emergency, as often as necessary.    Quick facts Under a Public Health Emergency, the Chief Public Health Officer may take any reasonable measure considered necessary to protect public health.  This could include making Orders — legally binding direction — to individuals and organizations including businesses, governments, agencies, and non-profit groups to respond to a Public Health Emergency.  Examples of Orders could be that individuals self-isolate, businesses enact emergency measures to alleviate health risks, or major changes be made to traffic incoming in the territory.  Quotes “This is the right step to take to protect all Northwest Territories residents from the spread of COVID-19. Nothing is off-the-table when it comes to keeping our residents safe, and our healthcare system strong. We urge all residents to do their part by following all advice from healthcare professionals every single day, and supporting each other as we all change our lifestyles in response to the pandemic. All residents should keep informed on the latest health information, and stay calm while we rise to this challenge together. ”  Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services “My advice to the Minister of Health and Social Services comes from the latest medical information across the country, and a careful consideration of the Northwest Territories’ unique situation. We are working around the clock — public health, nurses, doctors, and frontline staff — to address the spread of COVID-19. We are continuing to move forward with one of the most aggressive testing regimes in the country, tracking contact history of all possible patients, and taking appropriate action to reduce contact with others. Remember: our best defense against this virus is each other. If you’re sick, stay home, avoid contact with others, and call your local public health or healthcare centre. Wash your hands — a lot. Keep at least two metres between yourself and others.”  Dr. Kami Kandola, Chief Public Health Officer Related links Government of the Northwest Territories – Public Safety Notices, COVID-19 Information For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact: Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca  "

359,2020-03-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/media-statement-premier-cochrane-passing-john-havelock-parker,Government Website,Media Statement: Premier Cochrane on the passing of John Havelock Parker,"Premier Caroline Cochrane issued the following statement on the passing of former Commissioner John Havelock Parker: I am sad to learn of the passing of John Parker this past Monday, March 9. Mr. Parker moved north in 1954 to work in mining, eventually becoming manager of Rayrock Mine, and then President of Precambrian Mining Services Ltd. In 1959, he was elected as a Councillor for the Town of Yellowknife, serving for five years, before successfully running as Mayor of Yellowknife in 1964. In 1967, Mr. Parker was appointed to the Northwest Territories Council, and sat as Deputy Commissioner. With Commissioner Stuart Hodgson, he helped to bring the seat of the Government of the Northwest Territories from Ottawa to the new capital of Yellowknife, to be closer to the people it serves. In those days, the Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner held cabinet portfolios with their colleagues on the Executive Council. When appointed as Commissioner in 1979, Mr. Parker led the transition of the role of Commissioner from actively sitting in the Legislative Assembly and chairing Cabinet meetings, to its current role as the representative of the Crown and appointed by Canada, functioning similar to a lieutenant governor. In 1986, Mr. Parker was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for his significant contributions to the evolution and development of the territorial government and the municipal government of Yellowknife. Under Mr. Parker’s leadership, our system of government grew more responsible and representative of its people, for which we are exceedingly grateful. On behalf of all residents of the Northwest Territories, I offer my condolences to Mr. Parker’s family and friends in this difficult time."
360,2020-03-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-covid-19-update,Government Website,Diane Thom: COVID-19 Update,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide Members and the public with an update on NWT efforts in containing the spread of COVID-19 and assure everyone that their health and safety is the number one priority of our government. Currently, we have zero confirmed cases in the Northwest Territories. Our Chief Public Health Officer remains confident our residents are currently at a low risk of infection.  We also know that world-wide, roughly 80 percent of people infected get only mild symptoms.  We are working very hard to slow the spread of infection and know that everyone has a stake in doing their part.  We have been promoting good respiratory practices.  This means that you and your family members should stay home if you are sick and keep your distance from Elders and people who may have underlying conditions that make them vulnerable to infection. Wash your hands frequently, turn and cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing with your elbow, and making sure we are two metres apart in all social situations.  In this way we can slow the spread together.  Mr. Speaker, the Chief Public Health Officer is leading our public health response planning while the GNWT Territorial Planning Committee is leading the broader, all-of-government emergency response planning.   Our health system’s Emergency Operations Centre has been activated.  This allows us to coordinate rapid COVID-19 system planning and preparation.   A NWT COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Guide and Checklist is guiding our system preparations. We currently have a sufficient stockpile of personal protective equipment for frontline workers and will continue to track this.  Community Health Centre and hospitals are completing their planning and preparation and testing kits are in every community.   Mr. Speaker, NWT health professionals are testing residents and visitors for COVID-19 who present flu-like symptoms that have travelled outside of the NWT recently, regardless of where they have travelled.  This action permits us to take prompt action should a positive COVID-19 case be confirmed.  We began this enhanced testing well before Coronavirus was declared a pandemic and this is helping us. The Chief Public Health Officer issues regular public health alerts to frontline health professionals.  These alerts reinforce the need for heightened awareness and the use of best practices for communicable disease control at the local level.  Frontline staff and management are also ensuring protections and protocols are in place for workers and others within health facilities to reduce the spread of the virus in those settings. The Chief Public Health Officer has communicated to all NWT schools and daycares, advising on travel outside the NWT, planned international travel, and general advice to prevent infection. These letters were sent to parents and caregivers and are being updated.  Long-term care facilities have been provided information on precautions, protections, and protocols from the Chief Public Health Officer via our Health Authorities to all health care facilities and healthcare professionals; this advice includes following usual flu season-visitors’ hand-washing protocols and staying away if sick.   The Chief Public Health Officer is also assessing all mass gatherings to determine if they should proceed.  Most large indoor events have been cancelled and non-essential travel and attendance at conferences by GNWT employees has been suspended. Over the weekend, the Chief Public Health Officer issued new advice to our residents in keeping with the latest guidance from the Federal government.  We are strongly advising all travellers who have arrived or are arriving from international destinations to now self-isolate for 14 days.  These measures are necessary to combat the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. Mr. Speaker, I know there is a lot of uncertainty and anxiety among us all.  There is no denying that COVID-19 is a significant challenge around the world and in the NWT.  But it is important to remember that by following advice and working together we can to manage this together.   The Chief Public Health Officer and the Department are committed to providing residents with up to date information and will advise the public when confirmed cases have been identified in the NWT.  They are using every available means to communicate with residents in all official languages to provide the most current information so you know what is going on and what you need to do.  Mr. Speaker, Northerners are known for their strength, resiliency and strong sense of family and community.  I know that it is those qualities that we can draw on to keep our communities and our territory healthy.  Staying informed, following the advice provided by our health officials will help us all manage this unprecedented situation together. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak directly to all of our health care workers across our system.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication in making sure we are in the best place possible to respond to COVID-19.  I recognize that there are many challenges ahead and know that you will continue to serve our residents, as you always have, with professionalism, compassion and commitment.

361,2020-03-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-covid-19-preparedness,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: COVID-19 Preparedness,"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the members of this Assembly for taking the step of suspending its current sitting after today to allow Cabinet and the public service greater opportunity to prepare for the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  Although there remains no reported case in the NWT, our government continues to prepare for the impact of this pandemic.  Hour to hour, we are monitoring the state of the COVID-19 situation as it continues to evolve. I want to share with the Assembly some of the actions and planning that is underway.  Our health system has been preparing over the last few months, as the concern over this new virus became known. This planning has included securing additional supplies and preparing staff and facilities to respond to an outbreak.  Our health officials have also been working with partners - including the Government of Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada – to stay current with the most recent information and recommendations about this disease.   Based on these discussions, our Chief Public Health Officer has been working tirelessly with her colleagues to provide the best available advice to officials and the public about how to identify and care for those infected and prevent the spread of this disease. One thing we know is that we can slow the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact on our communities if everyone follows the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer, and takes the necessary precautions to protect themselves and most importantly to safeguard those who may be more vulnerable including our elders.  We are fortunate that our health system has not yet had to face any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the NWT, but we know that this virus is spreading and we all need to take personal steps to slow the spread of this illness. By slowing the rate of infection, our health system will be better able to effectively respond to this pandemic.    On Friday, our Health and Social Services Minister thanked our many health care professionals for their dedication and service, and Mr. Speaker on behalf of all of us here in this assembly, and on behalf of the people of the Northwest Territories, I want to also thank them for their efforts to look after us all. We know their work will become more challenging as the COVID-19 virus continues to spread.    Over the weekend, we have also taken the extraordinary step of asking our health care professionals to avoid any unnecessary travel outside of the NWT. This will prevent exposure and help avoid the potential requirements for isolation and will ensure that the NWT health system can maintain as much operational readiness as possible to manage the spread of this disease. Mr. Speaker, work to prepare for a COVID-19 pandemic in the Northwest Territories began even before the World Health Organization declared one. In addition to the measures our health system has put in place to identify, prevent and control the spread of infectious disease, our Government also has dedicated resources and procedures to manage emergencies.  Our Department of Municipal and Community Affairs includes the Emergency Management Organization established under the Emergency Management Act. Its role is, in part, to lead the Government of the Northwest Territories in the coordination of emergency management activities, support emergency management activities of local authorities, and coordinate and assist in the response of governments and public agencies.  The head of the Emergency Management Office also chairs the Territorial Planning Committee that works with community governments and other key partners to ensure readiness, and to respond to emergencies.   Again, although we have yet to face a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the NWT, we have taken the proactive step of activating an Emergency Operations Centre under MACA’s leadership as of March 13, 2020 and work will continue to assist all communities in the NWT to help prevent or manage any COVID-19 outbreak. Mr. Speaker, later this week I will also be convening a virtual meeting with community governments and Indigenous governments to share the latest information we have on our readiness and our plans. We will continue to meet regularly with them to work together to eliminate any gaps in our plans and support our efforts.   We know that many communities and jurisdictions in Canada and throughout the world have made the decision to temporarily close schools as result of this pandemic. The Minister of Education, Culture and Employment has consulted with the Chief Public Health Officer on this, and has received the advice today to close NWT schools until after Easter. Later today, the Minister will be convening a teleconference with all District Education Authorities to discuss this direction and how best to support school teachers, staff and students as they return from Spring Break travel. Mr. Speaker, as we prepare for this pandemic, the health and safety of our people is paramount. Every GNWT department and agency has been tasked with identifying and planning for the continuation of essential services. If a large number of our employees are required to self-isolate to prevent the further spread of the virus, we know that government services may face a significant disruption. It is critical that key services remain supported, and we are taking the proper steps to deal with a scenario where we have dramatically fewer available employees. All departments and agencies have been updating their Business Continuity Plans and later this week these plans will be finalized, and validated with table top exercises to ensure potential gaps have been identified and can be addressed. We know that the work of our government touches upon the lives of the people we serve in important ways, and that we need to make sure that there is as little disruption as possible should we find that many of our employees have to be isolated to care for themselves or others. Our planning will also consider how best to manage the NWT supply chain to help ensure that residents and businesses continue to receive essential services.  Mr. Speaker, it is important to state again that the NWT has no reported cases of COVID-19 and that the risk of contracting the disease in the NWT remains low today.  This does not mean that we can rest easy. We must be prepared to take preventative actions now.  In recent days, we have seen many jurisdictions implement new measures in response to having the virus already spreading within their borders. We have the ability to take measures sooner than others to better manage the risk. This will mean some disruption in travel for residents coming home who will need to self-isolate, and tourists who will have to postpone their visits the NWT. It is critically important that all residents of, and visitors to, the NWT take precautions and follow the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer. As our preparations continue it is also critical that our community partners work with MACA’s Emergency Operations Centre to ensure plans are in place, and that every effort is made to minimize the risk and manage the impacts of this pandemic.   We are implementing the best approaches available to slow and manage the spread of COVID-19. While we must not panic, we do have to take precautions.  I want to thank all residents of the Northwest Territories for their understanding as we direct more of the work of our government to managing this issue, and acknowledge that some of this effort will necessarily come at the expense of other priorities. However, protecting our most vulnerable from this pandemic is our most important priority, and we are working closely with our service providers to develop plans. Mr. Speaker, we know that the consequences of this pandemic are already having an impact on our economy, and that many of our residents and businesses will need support. These concerns have been raised with the Prime Minister, and I am very encouraged that there is clearly recognition that new federal programs and investments will be required to protect our economy. Additional options to provide support to our residents and businesses are being actively considered.    Information on the spread of this new virus and knowledge of how best to manage its impacts has been changing rapidly. That is why we are working closely with our partners from across all jurisdictions to stay up to date on the latest information. We will be providing daily reports and have set up a single portal for more information at www.gov.nt.ca and click on the corona virus feature box. The website is being updated as new information becomes available.  We recognize that people are concerned, but I want to remind everbody that we can all take practical steps to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. We will continue to update our residents, our communities, and Indigenous government partners, and I strongly urge everybody to check our website frequently and heed the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer and our Emergency Management Office as we work together to safeguard our friends, families and our elders. Mahsi, Mr. Speaker."

There are currently no cases of COVID-19 in the NWT, and the risk of acquiring the virus in the NWT and Canada remains low at this time.  Below is an at-a-glance update on the situation in the NWT as it currently stands. The GNWT is committed to providing updates in a consistent and timely manner and will be providing daily updates to media via email and will implement a weekly media briefing. The Health and Social Services website will also continue to be updated regularly and remains your best source for accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19.    At-a-Glance Update:  Health:  The GNWT recognizes that our health system faces unique Northern challenges in these types of emergency situations, and as a result have been in an active state of readiness for weeks - making the necessary preparations to address the anticipated surge in the number of NWT residents needing to receive health services in the coming weeks and months because of COVID-19. The NWT Chief Public Health Officer increased NWT surveillance to include testing anyone (residents and visitors) who arrives from outside of the NWT and show flu or cold like symptoms within 14 days of their arrival to test for COVID-19.  Having this enhanced surveillance allows for the identification and management of any cases early, thereby reducing the strain on our health care system. Health care providers are on alert to identify and manage possible cases in the NWT, as well as share healthy respiratory practices on an ongoing basis.  Ensuring the continuity of critical government services and programs during a territorial emergency is the responsibility of each GNWT department. Departments have been proactively identifying which services are critical, and putting plans to support their continuation if impacted as this situation evolves. Emergency Measures  The Emergency Management Office (EMO) coordinates the GNWT response in emergencies and is monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely to identify emergency preparedness needs of communities and potential impacts to communities and critical infrastructure. The EMO has been activated to coordinate a broader emergency response. A communications working group has been established to support this group to ensure the public has timely and accurate information.   Residents may notice enhanced signage and prominence of hand hygiene stations at our health facilities. This is for the safety of residents, staff, and patients. Visitors to facilities may be asked screening questions to ensure we are protecting patients at acute care sites and residents at long term care facilities. Residents who are currently experiencing illness or who meet the criteria for self-isolation must call for advice regarding treatment options before presenting to a facility. For more information visit the Health and Social Services website.  Education  Education, Culture and Employment has met with education bodies who are prepared to put their contingency plans in place for school closures should the Chief Public Health Officer direct this action.  Tourism  Industry, Tourism and Investment is working with NWT Tourism to communicate with licenced tourism operators across the NWT, and have provided information about COVID-19 from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer to them – and to their guests.  Human Resources  As one of the NWT’s largest employers, the GNWT is committed to supporting our employees and their families as we are all faced with this ever-changing situation.  Regardless of their current leave balances, all employees will be able to access sick and/or special leave to deal with the impacts of COVID-19 on their families, if required. All duty and work related travel outside of the territory for GNWT employees has been cancelled or suspended. Employees can make use of our Employee Family Assistance Program, as required.  This situation is evolving quickly. The GNWT is confident it is taking all the necessary preparedness steps to ensure the health and safety of NWT residents, and will continue to provide updates.    For all media requests related to COVID-19, please contact:  Trista Haugland Media and Communications Coordinator, Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  Ph: (867) 767-9140 ext. 11092  Email: Trista_Haugland@gov.nt.ca "

We’ve been making necessary preparations to address a surge in the number of NWT residents needing to receive health services in the coming weeks and months because of COVID-19. We have also been carrying out comprehensive public health surveillance measures, at times going above and beyond what was being recommended by the federal government.

I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the dedication and professionalism of the frontline and support staff of the health and social services system. I know staff are strongly committed to ensuring the health of NWT residents.

I want to reassure residents that the risk of getting COVID-19 in the NWT is low at this time.

Simpson: Rendez-vous de la Francophonie,"Monsieur le President, I am proud to celebrate the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories during the 22nd Annual Rendez-vous de la Francophonie. This nationwide initiative, held every March, is an opportunity for Canada’s 9.5 million French-speakers to promote the French language, and celebrate the many ways it is expressed throughout the country. The Rendez-vous encourages us to celebrate the strength in our diversity and cooperatively address the challenges we face as a territory. This year’s theme of au centre d’un changement is especially relevant as we begin the work to achieve the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly. It is a welcome reminder to embrace a spirit of unity aimed at improving the quality of life for all of our residents. Monsieur le President, this government is committed to providing our French-speaking residents with quality public services and communications. That is why we launched our first annual Francophone Community Satisfaction Survey earlier this month. The survey, available on the Department of Education, Culture and Employment’s website until March 31, 2020, will help us to determine the Francophone community’s level of awareness of the Government of the Northwest Territories' French language communications and how satisfied they are with those services.  We are partnering with Francophone organizations in areas like immigration. During Francophone Immigration Week in 2019, the Government of the Northwest Territories launched the Welcome to the NWT resource book for newcomers at an event hosted by the Northwest Territories’ Francophone immigration network. This guide was designed to help attract, settle, and ensure the retention of foreign nationals to the Northwest Territories, and connect newcomers with the services and resources they need to settle comfortably into their new home communities. We continue to support and engage with Collège nordique francophone. Collège nordique francophone plays a significant role in ensuring diversity in the postsecondary education system, offering language courses and a variety of postsecondary education diploma programs in cooperation with southern institutions. To support this important work, we recently signed a new, three-year contribution agreement with Collège nordique francophone that will begin in the new fiscal year. Monsieur le President, our diverse French population contributes a cultural richness to our communities, not only through language, but through dance, art, food, film, music, ideas, love for the land, and above all, a passion for interconnectedness and cultural exchange.  I am grateful for the gifts we continue to receive from the members of our vibrant and growing Francophone population. Let us continue to work together to celebrate our diversity and to strengthen the social, cultural and economic landscape of the Northwest Territories. Merci, Mr. Speaker."

At the same time as providing this recognition, we, of course, have to acknowledge the profound disappointment at the difficult but necessary decision to cancel the 2020 Arctic Winter Games due to the risk presented by the COVID-19 virus. The decision to cancel the games could not have been an easy one, but ultimately, doing what was in the best interests of the health and safety of all those involved had to be the priority.  Mr. Speaker, it is truly unfortunate that there will be no games. Team NT still deserves our thanks and our recognition. Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide Members with some information about Team NT: At the Territorial Trials, 746 athletes, coaches and chaperones from 23 NWT communities competed for the opportunity to represent the NWT. Of this 344 were female participants and 402 were male participants. The 2020 Arctic Winter Games Team consists of 355 participants including athletes, coaches and mission staff from 20 different communities. In addition, 17 officials from across the NWT were scheduled to be involved. Team NT athletes were set to compete in all 20 sports.  Team NT also included a cultural contingent that was going to celebrate our cultural heritage.  17 NWT Youth Ambassadors, with representation from all regions in the Territory, were also set to go to Whitehorse as volunteers. The NWT Youth Ambassador Program (NWT YAP) has been in operation in the Northwest Territories for 12 years, and offers a guided and structured volunteer experience for NWT youth at major territorial, national and international events. Participants have the opportunity to develop life and job skills as well as to build the confidence necessary to deal with complex life challenges. Mr. Speaker,  everyone who is part of Team NT and the contingent who was going to the Arctic Winter games had worked hard for many months and in some cases years to prepare for these games. Team NT is built with the collaboration of so many people who deserve our thanks: Volunteers, sport organizations, and the tireless efforts of parents. I want to say thank you to everyone for all their efforts in the early morning drives, the long hours of practice, and the lessons in fair play and determination. We know the life lessons that involvement in sports teaches are very valuable. What we hope our young people take away from this difficult lesson is that the reward and pride in accomplishment is in the journey.     Mr. Speaker, I want to advise Members that Team NT will be refunded for their deposits and to keep their uniforms. Unfortunately, due to the scope and magnitude that goes into planning events of this type, postponing the games or holding alternative events is not an option.   To close, I would like to extend my thanks to Mr. Doug Rentmeister, Chef de Mission, Mr. Damon Crossman and Mr. Bill Othmer, Assistant Chef de Missions for Team NT  and all the rest of their mission staff as well as the Sport North Federation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
369,2020-03-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-northwest-territories-policing-priorities,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Northwest Territories Policing Priorities,"Mr. Speaker, as Minister of Justice one of my responsibilities is to set the objectives, priorities and goals of the Territorial Police Service. While the GNWT respects the operational independence of the RCMP, the intention of setting these objectives is to establish a broad strategic direction for the delivery of policing services in the Northwest Territories that incorporates the unique needs of our communities. Through past priority setting exercises the RCMP have been asked to place a focus on increasing public trust in policing services, working with partners to improve responses to vulnerable populations, being innovative in addressing community safety, and ensuring a culturally-informed, safe approach to service provision.  Mr. Speaker, the annual policing priorities have traditionally been set directly by the Minister. To ensure that I consider the diverse perspectives of the many unique communities in the Northwest Territories, and that this process is undertaken with transparency, I have invited the leadership of Indigenous, municipal, and community governments to share their views with me on what is most important to their community when it comes to community policing services.  As leaders in their respective communities, I know they are best positioned to share this perspective with me. Seeking their input reflects Cabinet’s commitment to support and enhance our relationships with community and Indigenous governments, and to promote community self-sufficiency. Their contributions in this regard will be used to guide the development of the 2020-2021 broad strategic direction that I will set for the RCMP. It is my intention going forward to engage in this outreach on an annual basis.  These priorities help lead the RCMP and community leadership to develop annual Policing Priority Action Plans. This collaborative work supports the building of trust between RCMP members and the communities they serve, and formalized the engagement efforts of RCMP Detachment Commanders across the NWT. The action plans are revisited annually and revised as necessary by the community and the RCMP, recognizing the shared responsibilities in addressing service provision. Through this process, communities have a direct role in making their community safer. I applaud the work that the RCMP and community leadership have accomplished together to enhance the quality of life in our communities.  Mr. Speaker, few services have as direct an impact on our citizens as the policing services provided by the RCMP. Although we are very fortunate to be provided a professional service by a national police force, and by a division dedicated to community policing, it is incredibly important that we ensure that service reflects the unique context of our Territory. The ultimate goal we are all working towards together is safe communities where our citizens can thrive. I look forward to hearing and understanding the insights of community leadership in shaping the Ministerial priorities for the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
370,2020-03-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-value-tourism,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Value of Tourism,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, when we talk about the value of tourism in the Northwest Territories we often speak in terms of the dollars spent and the number of visitors tallied.  In 2018-2019, the tourism industry showed record numbers in both of these categories, emphasizing once again that the approach to, and investments in, our Tourism 2020 Strategy are working. In fact, over the last five years have increased the number of visitors to our territory by 42% and boosted spending by 43%. As we look to grow and diversify our territory’s economy, these figures are important to our economic outlook. This growth in tourism means new tourism businesses and new service providers. With growth and diversification comes increased employment in our tourism sector and new revenue for our economy. However Mr. Speaker, the full value of tourism is so much more.   In Inuvik, Alestine’s eatery is a constant flurry of activity. Thanks to a regular and growing client base of summer road-tripping visitors, their business is thriving. What is unsaid, and sometimes unnoticed, is that Alestine’s success as a tourism destination means that Inuvik residents also have a restaurant to enjoy year-round. In Tulita, campgrounds and walking trails have been built to accommodate tourists travelling the Mackenzie and Great Bear Rivers however local residents are also benefitting. Families are walking the groomed paths together, healthy eating workshops are being held in the picnic areas, and sharing circles are taking place in the campground teepee.  In Jean Marie River, local artist and Bed and Breakfast owner Lucy Simon shares the art of moosehair tufting, a traditional skill that she is helping to keep alive thanks to the tourism demand for her product. As Ms. Simon shares her creative process with her guests, she is also teaching her skills to a new generation, preserving and sharing this time-honoured activity that was once passed on to her. In Fort Smith, Northwestern Air Lease has seen a significant increase in their tourism-related bookings over the last four years. As a result, young athletes from the region are now benefiting from the company’s success, thanks to discounted rates for teams and groups travelling to compete at sporting events. In Yellowknife, busses and vans park outside Weaver & Devore to allow tourists to flock inside. While this fourth generation family-run business was established almost exclusively to serve mining camps and fishers, tourists now line the aisles as well; providing benefits and opportunities for yet another generation of staff and their families. Mr. Speaker, while our government supports the tourism sector with investments in destination marketing, industry capacity building, and community readiness, we all play a part in its success.  Our North is known for its spectacular landscapes and adventures; its strong Indigenous cultures and traditions; the midnight sun; and Aurora Borealis. But most of all Mr. Speaker, our North is known for its people, their warm welcoming spirit and our world renowned northern hospitality. With the success of our tourism industry, however, there may be times when influx of visitors to our territory puts a strain on our communities and their resources. More people wanting to visit our territory is the kind if challenge we want to have though, and we will continue to work with communities to develop services and options for visitors across the NWT. Mr. Speaker, in coming weeks, using the #Value of Tourism NWT, NWT residents will have the opportunity to read more about the projects that I have highlighted today.  In doing so, I hope that we will all come to recognize that the value of tourism is much more than just economic.  Yes, tourism continues to be an economic driver across the Northwest Territories, injecting over $200 million dollars into our economy annually, but the value of tourism is also found in the infrastructure and services that we enjoy as residents. It is reflected in the preservation of our traditions and cultures and it is implicit in the wellness of our communities and our families. Tourism highlights for the world what those of us living in the North already know, what a wonderful and magical place it is to live.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker  "

372,2020-03-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/new-student-information-system-benefits-aurora-college-students,Government Website,New student information system benefits Aurora College students,"A significant step in strengthening the foundation of Aurora College was made last week when the College launched a new Student Information System. The new system will improve the quality of students’ educational experience and provide data to inform future decision-making as Aurora College transforms to a polytechnic university.  The new information system, a GNWT investment in Aurora College, collects and provides accurate and accessible data ensuring the College can meet the demands of a modern post-secondary institution both during and after its transformation to a polytechnic university.  Aurora College and the Department of Education, Culture and Employment have worked in close collaboration on the implementation of the new system. While the project had been in the planning stages for several years, its implementation fulfils an important commitment made by the GNWT in the Government Response to the Findings and Recommendations of the Aurora College Foundational Review.  The new system, PowerCampus, allows students to access timely information about their own academic journey, and to personally manage more of their interactions with Aurora College. PowerCampus collects a great deal of information and benefits students including providing them with the online ability to:  Apply for Aurora College programs  Select their classes Check their marks Pay their tuition Pay their rent; and View their schedule  The report generation function of the system will provide staff and faculty with information throughout the various stages of the student lifecycle, to inform timely decision-making which, in turn, will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the College and improve the student experience.                                                                                                 In addition to these benefits, PowerCampus will allow Aurora College to more effectively communicate with current and prospective students, as well as alumni and former students.    Quote “Good decisions are based on good data and the new student information system will provide us with the quality data about Aurora College programs and students we need to support student success and to inform our decisions about the future of the College as we continue our planning for the future. The launch of this system is the completion of a GNWT commitment and is a key milestone in Aurora College’s transformation into a polytechnic university.” – R. J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   Quick Facts Ellucian PowerCampus is a student information system that is used by post-secondary institutions across the globe. The cost of purchasing and implementing PowerCampus was approximately $1.0 million.  Aurora College faculty and staff have been using elements of PowerCampus since July 2019, with ongoing training throughout the first year of the implementation.

373,2020-03-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-phase-one-strengthening-foundation-aurora-college-and-planning-change,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Phase One: Strengthening the Foundation of Aurora College and Planning for Change,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, the transformation of Aurora College into a world class polytechnic university is well underway. As the Legislative Assembly is aware, the transformation will happen in three phases. We are currently in Phase One, which is what I want to talk about today. Phase One is focused on strengthening the foundation of the existing college, ensuring we understand the detailed steps ahead of us, and determining what we, as a territory, want the polytechnic university to be. The first step in Phase One was the development of a vision for postsecondary education. This vision was developed with direct input from the public, Indigenous governments, and postsecondary institutions operating in the Northwest Territories. The vision is that quote “Every resident of the Northwest Territories has an equitable opportunity to reach their full potential by obtaining a postsecondary education from institutions that are student centered, accessible, high quality, relevant and accountable.” End quote.  To help realize this vision, five goals were developed:  prioritize students’ success,  increase access to postsecondary education opportunities,  remain responsive to labour demands in the Northwest Territories,  remain responsive to local and regional needs; and  support the growth of the knowledge economy.  The vision and goals will help guide us as we make decisions, as will the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Calls for Justice, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The transformation is a collaborative effort between Aurora College and Education, Culture and Employment. The joint Executive Leadership Committee from the College and Education, Culture and Employment is responsible for leading the transformation within Aurora College, supported by working groups made up of Aurora College employees.  Much of the work that has already been completed, and is currently underway, is focused on strengthening the foundations of the College. A comprehensive policy review is being undertaken, to ensure that the College’s policies and processes meet national standards. A highlight of this work is the recently developed and adopted Academic Program Review Framework, which conforms to the standards outlined in the Council of Ministers of Educations’ Ministerial Statement on Quality Assurance of Degree Education in Canada. This replaced a previous program review process which fell short in areas of quality assurance, and did not ensure reviews were conducted at arm’s length. To support this type of work, as well as other aspects of the transformation, Phase One has also seen the creation of an Academic Advisory Council. This body, made up eight highly-regarded academic institutions with relevant experience, provides support and guidance on the technical aspects of the transformation. We are also re-envisioning what it means to be learning centred, by identifying what we already do well and developing additional, innovative solutions to support students. This is being accomplished by setting service standards for all phases of a student’s life cycle, starting at the point that a student begins to consider applying to the College, and continuing through the application process, the transition to college life, the time spent as a student, program completion, and transitioning out of the college and into the job market.  To support the student experience, the College just launched a new Student Information System. This system gives students, for the first time, the ability to apply for programs, select classes, check marks, and access their information online. This is a major milestone for the College, and brings it in line with major academic institutions across the country.  On the back end, this system will also provide the College with up-to-date data that will help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the College and the student experience. Mr. Speaker, the student experience can vary greatly depending on what you are studying, and where you are studying it. In recognition of this, we will soon begin work on a Regional Needs Assessment. The goal of this work is to understand how residents currently access adult and postsecondary education, how they would like to access it, and the barriers to access that they face. The information gathered through the Regional Needs Assessment will be absolutely vital in ensuring that we are designing a polytechnic university that best serves our residents.  This year, we will also begin our Capital Planning Study. Aurora College has some beautiful facilities, and certain campuses and learning centres can likely accommodate significant growth, but we know there are improvements that we need to make in order to offer the world class experience students deserve. Before the end of Phase One, we will have a capital plan that will lay out the physical nature of the future polytechnic university. This work will go hand in hand with our work to determine Areas of Specialization. Each campus has natural advantages due to their locations and the facilities that currently exist. We want to build on those advantages, and ensure that as we move forward we are strengthening each campus and bolstering our community learning centres.  Mr. Speaker, the transformation is a monumental undertaking. That will soon come into clear view, when we release our Implementation Plan, which outlines the steps and timelines in the transformation over the next six years. To help keep us on track, ground decision-making, and guide the direction of the college as it continues through the transformation process we will be releasing a 3-year Strategic Plan for Aurora College later this year.  Mr. Speaker, as I have stated before, we cannot do this alone, and we are not going to try to. Members of the public, Indigenous governments, industry, and Members of this House, will all have opportunities to contribute to the transformation.  Mr. Speaker, Phase One: Strengthening the Foundation and Planning for Change is planned to be completed by the fall of 2021, at which point we move into Phase Two: Transformational Change. In Phase Two, we will start making the wide ranging changes to the structure of the College that will bring us closer to our ultimate goal. I will speak more about Phase Two in the coming weeks.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
374,2020-03-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-international-womens-day,Government Website,Diane Thom: International Women's Day,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge International Women’s Day.  International Women’s Day is held annually on March 8th to celebrate women and girls’ social, cultural and political achievements throughout history, across nations, and to raise awareness about the work left to be done.  The theme of this year’s International Women’s Day is Because of You.  As Minister Responsible for the Status of Women, and on behalf of all of Cabinet, I can proudly say that we are committed to continuing to work on achieving gender equality throughout our society.  The theme Because of You celebrates women who work at advancing gender equality in all areas of our society for women and girls.  The theme also asks Canadians to honour role models in their own lives.   Here in the Northwest Territories, we have many examples of outstanding role models who have made a difference.  The Honourable Nellie Cournoyea is one such role model.  She served as Premier from 1991 to 1995.  She was not only the first female Premier of the Northwest Territories, she was the first female Indigenous Premier elected, and the second female Premier to serve in Canadian history.   Another role model is Ethel Blondin-Andrew, who continues to advocate on behalf of the Sahtu and represented the people of the Northwest Territories as the first Indigenous woman elected to the Parliament of Canada.  The late Bertha Allen who co-founded the Native Women’s Association of the NWT was also a very important role model for many, as she fought tirelessly for social change and the advancement of Indigenous women and girls.   Other examples of Northern women who stand as our role models include Lyda Fuller, a longtime Executive Director of the YWCA here in Yellowknife.  Ms. Fuller is a nationally recognized advocate for women and girls.  She is a strong voice in the fight against, family violence, homelessness and poverty.  Another example is Leela Gilday, who is a well-known recording artist who not only incorporates but celebrates her Indigenous heritage in her music.  These are just a few examples of the strong women role models that we have here in the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, these women, along with many others, have worked hard to achieve their goals and to make a difference in their communities and in the North.  Some are prominent figures and some work quietly behind the scenes.  However they choose to achieve their goals, they are making a difference and they are creating change.  It is only right that we should acknowledge and celebrate the difference they are making. In keeping with this year’s theme, I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and honour my esteemed female colleagues sitting with us in this House.  Each of us, individually, when we decided to put our names forth to become a Member of this Legislative Assembly, sent a message that women can be effective leaders, that we can make a difference and that we were willing to do the job required to make positive change.  Being willing to pursue an elected position is not a decision one makes lightly.   There are many challenges that women face when seeking a leadership role.  Role models inspire us to take on these leadership roles and I would like to give my heartfelt thanks to those women who inspire each of us in one way or another.  Mr. Speaker, the voters in the Northwest Territories set an example for the rest of Canada when they elected nine women to the Legislative Assembly, which created the first gender balanced Legislature in Canadian history.  We should be proud of this achievement and we should continue to work every day to achieve gender equity.  We must work together to move this forward.  I invite all Members of the Legislative Assembly to join me in recognizing International Women’s Day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
375,2020-03-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-northern-distance-learning,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Northern Distance Learning  ,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, today I want to focus on one of the successes that has come from the Education, Renewal and Innovation Framework. The Northern Distance Learning program, otherwise known as NDL, is a way to offer higher-level academic courses to high school students in small communities, to prepare them for postsecondary. By the upcoming 2020-2021 school year, this program will be available to students in up to 20 small communities across the territory. Northern Distance Learning program began at East Three School in Inuvik under the leadership of the Beaufort-Delta Divisional Education Council. The program proved that when students had opportunities to interact with each other, had access to in-class support staff and had dedicated, knowledgeable teachers, they were able to be successful whether sitting beside each other in the same classroom, or separated by hundreds of miles. There are currently 75 high school students in grades 10, 11 and 12 from small communities enrolled in Northern Distance Learning, taking academic, -1 courses in mathematics, science, English language arts, social studies, and art. Mr. Speaker, the course completion rate for traditional correspondence courses is just 30 percent. However, the completion rate for Northern Distance Learning courses is approximately 75 percent. It is a game changer, Mr. Speaker. Two years ago in Ulukhaktok, for the first time in the community’s history, three students graduated in their community with the courses they needed to advance directly to university. This was a historic moment for the community, and it was made possible by a combination of Northern Distance Learning, a lot of hard work and dedication by those graduates.  The expansion of the program also into the South Slave allowed Laney Beaulieu, a student from Fort Resolution, to stay in her community and complete the courses she needed to get into Western University in Ontario, where she is currently studying medicine.   Marie Lennie, a current Northern Distance Learning student from Délı̨nę, voiced her support for the program in an online video made for one of her NDL classes: quote “The experience so far is great,” she said. “I’m learning new things every day and succeeding in getting quality education without the need to move somewhere else for schooling. I highly recommend NDL for other Indigenous students who want a better education.” End quote. In addition to creating new learning opportunities, Northern Distance Learning is now also being used to allow parents in small communities to attend Parent-Teacher conferences with teachers in Inuvik. The first conference was held this past December, and connected parents, teachers, and in-class support staff spread across different communities.  Mr. Speaker, finally I want to celebrate Northern Distance Learning’s first ever Post-Secondary Bridging Experience that was held this past October with a group of 12 NDL students. The Northern Youth Abroad program organized and supervised a trip to Calgary, to help students get a better sense of what to expect in a postsecondary setting outside of the Northwest Territories. Students visited the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology and Mount Royal University and took part in workshops and activities that will help prepare them for the transition to postsecondary life. Akesha Hardisty-Norwegian from Fort Simpson commented, quote “I really liked the planning part because there is not much help in small communities. When they do help, they do not have as much info as what we got on the trip. Thank you for giving us this opportunity. It helped raise my awareness and confidence going into post-secondary.” End quote.Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled to share that on November 22, 2019, Akesha was accepted to the University of Alberta in the combined Kinesiology/Education program for September 2020. Others are looking at postsecondary options across Canada in psychology, architecture, justice studies, veterinary medicine, and recreation management.  Mr. Speaker, we all know that we have to do a better job delivering equitable education across the territory, and Northern Distance Learning is helping us level the playing field by giving students in small communities opportunities that did not exist only a few short years ago. The data, and the individual experiences, show us that this program is working. We still have a long way to go, and the achievements of Northern Distance Learning students are proof that we can, and will continue to, improve educational outcomes across the territory. Mahsı, Mr. Speaker."

377,2020-03-03,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-promoting-importance-oral-health,Government Website,Diane Thom: Promoting Importance of Oral Health,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, good oral health is important to our overall health and quality of life.  Healthy mouths and teeth in children promote healthy growth, nutrition, speech development, good school performance and social well-being.  Cavities, however, are the most common chronic infectious childhood disease, and they place a substantial burden on our population.  Poor oral health contributes to a child’s inability to eat, speak, sleep and learn.  In adults, oral disease has been linked to diabetes, heart disease, pneumonia and Alzheimer’s. Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that while dental treatment services are not an insured service paid for by the NWT Health Care Plan, our government is working to reduce oral disease among children and youth through the Oral Health Action Plan released in October 2018.   This Plan outlines four key action areas to improve oral health outcomes to promote oral health throughout the entire NWT population; to establish systematic supports for improved oral health services; to implement the NWT Oral Health Service Delivery Model; and to provide high quality, sustainable and culturally-safe care. Some highlights of what has been done since the release of the Action Plan include the addition of a Registered Dental Hygienist in Norman Wells and the roll out of daily brushing programs in daycares and schools in our communities. There have also been investments in dental equipment across the territory by the federal government to support the delivery of dental services in communities where there are no established dental clinics.   As part of this Action Plan, frontline primary health care providers have begun to integrate oral health screening and education for children and expectant mothers during Prenatal and Well Child Record appointments as well.   The Department of Health and Social Services and health Authorities are also collaborating with community partners to deliver a multi-age group oral health literacy program.  This program will feature arts-based learning in schools and at community gatherings.  Finally, a territory-wide oral health social marketing campaign will be launched this spring to encourage better oral health self-care to improve oral health outcomes in the NWT.  Mr. Speaker, research shows that starting good oral health practices in early childhood will ensure that children will continue to practice brushing and flossing as part of their daily routine.  This is why we partnered with the NWT Literacy Council to provide parents with a brushing song book that they can sing along with their children aged one to four.  Our Ever Awesome NWT Brushing Song book, which I will be tabling later today, was illustrated by Neiva Mateus and written by Tłı̨chǫ Dene author Richard Van Camp. Funding was provided by the federal governments’  Children’s Oral Health Initiative.  The aim of the book is to provide parents with a resource that makes brushing and flossing with their children something that is a fun, daily, family activity.  The brushing song book also promotes the importance of snuggling, reading to one another, and sharing time with each other. It honours the gift of family by looking after their health and spending time together. Over the months of March and April, Richard Van Camp will be touring communities in the NWT to raise awareness about the book and the importance of oral health. The book will be translated into all the NWT official Indigenous languages, and the audio files for the song will be made available on the Department’s website. An animated storyboard promoting oral health for older children is also being produced in all the NWT official languages.  We are looking forward to the first screening of this original media project later this summer. Mr. Speaker, oral health is an important part of our overall health.  This book is one of many resources that we will be developing for parents and caregivers to help them teach good oral health practices to their children.  I want to thank Richard Van Camp, Neiva Mateus, and the NWT Literacy Council for partnering with us to raise awareness about good oral health.  I encourage all parents to embrace the idea of fun-filled brushing and flossing time with their children, and encourage everyone to give oral health the time and respect it deserves as an important part of overall health and wellbeing. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Having those strong networks of your longtime friends and family around you has impacts on your health as you age.  Having the supports to age-in-place in your home community will improve the quality of life for seniors and may prevent early admission to long-term more-intensive care facilities. I am pleased to advise Members that we will be ready to open the new Fort Good Hope Seniors Centre this Spring.  This centre is the last of five seniors centres that were designed in conjunction with the Department of Health and Social Services, taking into consideration local guidance and input.  The development of these units has improved the lives of seniors in Aklavik, Fort Liard, Fort McPherson, Whatì, and soon Fort Good Hope.  These complexes feature eight units that will be occupied by seniors and one unit will be designated as a caretaker unit.  An on-site caretaker improves the safety and security of the building.  As part of the design, these buildings feature common areas where therapeutic and lifestyle programming can be delivered to seniors.   The design includes no-step entrances to suites, wider doorways, and a common space that is used for delivery of Health and Social Services programming. Mr. Speaker, seniors are the bedrock of our lives. They have been there for us since the day we were born. They have given so much to us.  Their knowledge, their guidance and their love.  As such, we needed to take the time and use the necessary resources to ensure that these units were built to the best standard available.  It is important that we give back to the ones that have given us so much.  I look forward to opening this facility and celebrating with Elders and their families as they move in to their new home. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  "
380,2020-03-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-colorectal-cancer-awareness-month,Government Website,Diane Thom: Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, we all want better health for our families and communities.  The choices we make are important for our overall health and well-being.  By eating good food, being physically active, reducing the amount of alcohol we drink, living tobacco free, and making healthy choices, we can help reduce the risk of getting chronic diseases like cancer. Cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada, and it is important that we talk about it.  Over the past few decades, we have learned more about cancer, which is resulting in more people surviving cancer than ever before.  This is why it is important to observe cancer awareness months.  Mr. Speaker, this month is Colorectal Awareness Month, and it is dedicated to raising awareness about colorectal cancer and honouring those who have been affected by this disease.  Colorectal cancer is preventable and treatable, yet here in the Northwest Territories, the incidence of being diagnosed with colorectal cancer is twice the rate than in the rest of Canada.  Many people are unaware that they can reduce the risk of getting it with timely screening and healthy lifestyles.  Mr. Speaker, the best protection we have against colorectal cancer is early detection. Taking a Fecal Immunochemical Test, or FIT test, is the easiest way for NWT residents to learn if they are at risk of colorectal cancer.  In an effort to improve screening and early detection, a “one and done” FIT screening method was introduced in 2018.  This approach makes it easier for people to collect a sample at home and return it to their healthcare provider.  The FIT test, which you can easily do at home, is recommended for residents aged 50 to 74 and should be completed at least every two years. 	To increase screening rates for colorectal cancer in our territory, Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority just launched a pilot project in February to mail FIT screening kits to eligible residents.  The pilot project focuses on the Beaufort-Delta Region.  If this approach is successful it will be expanded across the territory.  Our aim is to increase our participation screening rate to meet the national goal of 60%. Mr. Speaker, we have also distributed Community Cancer Awareness kits to community health representatives.  Health care staff can use these comprehensive kits in their communities to raise awareness and have conversations with residents about the importance of early screening and healthy living.  In February, the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority also launched two educational cancer videos.  Part of a seven part series, these videos aim to help residents better understand cancer and the importance of screening in the NWT.  These videos were created in partnership with the Department of Health and Social Services and the University of Alberta’s Indigenous and Global Health Research group.  The videos were developed through community consultations in the NWT and incorporated feedback from community members in Fort Good Hope, Inuvik, and Yellowknife.  Residents can view them on the cancernwt.ca website.  The videos were also distributed to local health centres for use, and will be promoted on social media.  While it is important to improve screening rates and to communicate directly about cancer with NWT residents, it is also critical that we support those patients who are battling cancer right now.  We know that the emotional and physical effects of cancer can make it difficult for cancer patients to process information.  To help support patients and their families, the NWT Health Authority has hired and trained two full-time cancer Nurse Navigators.  The Nurse Navigators are specially trained to help patients and their families throughout their cancer journey. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage all residents, particularly those aged 50 to 74, to speak to their health care providers about getting screened.  Let us work together to promote healthy living, reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers, and support those who are living with it.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
381,2020-03-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-conservation-network-gathering,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Conservation Network Gathering,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, the 19th Legislative Assembly believes our decisions must reflect a full understanding of our communities and regions. It is our responsibility to ensure that the needs of our residents are reflected in the decisions that will impact them.  This is especially important when it comes to decisions about the land, Mr. Speaker. That’s why our northern Indigenous governments and communities are at the heart of our northern approach to establishing and managing protected areas. The Northwest Territories is a leader in Canada when it comes to conservation planning. We work closely with our Indigenous partners to protect the Northwest Territories’ natural and cultural diversity.  Today, I am pleased to tell you about a gathering that was held in Yellowknife recently to help advance this important work. On February 26th and 27th, 2020, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources hosted this territory’s first Conservation Network Gathering. The idea behind this gathering, Mr. Speaker, is to share experiences and build partnerships to manage territorial protected areas under the new Protected Areas Act. More than 100 partners from across the Northwest Territories took part in the two-day gathering, including Indigenous governments and organizations, territorial and federal departments, funders, academics and conservation leaders from across Canada. Topics discussed included: new ideas in conservation and stewardship; the role of Indigenous guardians; and on-the-land success stories. They also talked about the financial realities of protected areas, and best practices for management and research. Healthy Land, Healthy People is our five-year plan for conservation network planning. It lays out how the Government of the Northwest Territories is moving forward together with its partners to protect the integrity of our northern ecosystems. Protected areas can also provide new job opportunities for small communities, 	Mr. Speaker. Guardian programs, land-based products and cultural tourism are all ways we can expand and diversify our economy. Over the coming months, Environment and Natural Resources will work closely with our partners to develop a new Healthy Land, Healthy People work plan to guide us over the next five years. Mr. Speaker, we need to hear from all stakeholders as we determine a path forward. That is why I am pleased to confirm that we have secured federal funding for the next three years to make the Conservation Network Gathering an annual event. Mr. Speaker, we look forward to working together to develop the next made-in-the-North conservation work plan, to keep our land healthy for current and future Northerners and visitors to enjoy.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
382,2020-03-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-invest-canada-north-partner-highlight,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Invest Canada North Partner Highlight ,"Check against delivery  Good Morning and thank you for being here with us today.  It’s so great to have Invest Canada North taking place this year during PDAC – it will inevitably open up opportunities for our Northern territories, in a way that we’ve not previously experienced at this conference. Across the North and in the NWT we recognize that competition for exploration and development dollars is strong, but I believe we offer unique benefits for those looking to do business, and I am going to tell you what those are.  One of the really important factors that I want to reassure potential investors of is that increasing resource development and exploration in the Northwest Territories is a priority for the newly elected government.  This is essential because that means that when you come to our territory and want to do business, we are there to help you along the way, and have just as much invested in your project and the path you take.  The Northwest Territories has often been known as the home of Canadian Diamonds. But we’re more than that.  If you were at the ICN Reception last night, you may have heard in the video our Premier state that investments in the NWT are more than just investments in our people.  She said that when you invest in the Northwest Territories, you’re doing more than investing in our people; you’re also contributing to world-wide efforts to fuel our global green economy.  As the federal government drives its agenda of innovation and technology, attention and awareness is growing regarding the NWT’s strategic and critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, tungsten and rare earth elements. We also still have some of the largest confirmed deposits of gold, zinc, and other base metals in the country.  There is so much potential in the Northwest Territories, but that isn’t the whole story. You need to have a solid foundation of support and partnership to realize the full benefits, and we’re leading the way in this area as well.  Investors want to know that the people and the place they’re doing business, is in support. Well, I already told you that the government is on board, but what I haven’t told you is that so are our residents.  Northerners support mining. 86% of NWT residents believe a strong mining sector is vital to the long-term health of the NWT and 82% want to see more mining projects in our territory.  NWT residents and businesses support mining because they are an important part of our mining sector.   Mining has driven the NWT economy for a long time.  Many of the territories leaders worked in mines and the exploration sector. When the diamond mines arrived, it was a natural evolution to get involved.   Indigenous governments in our territory also have a vested interest.  They share in the resource royalties paid by our mines and their development corporations work in the resource sector.  In the NWT, we have passed modern, competitive, made-in-the North legislation to govern our industry. Our government has committed to completing a review of our territory’s premier incentive program for mining and to identify new ways to support advanced projects, and increase funding for mining incentive programs by 50% over the next four years.  We’re investing in new geoscience to map our potential in exciting areas for explorers, including work in the Slave Geological Province — one of the highest-potential mineral regions in Canada. And our government has a million dollar Mining Incentive Program available to prospectors and exploration companies carrying out mineral exploration in our territory. By trade, I am what I like to call a boots-on-the-ground project engineer, and I wanted to run for politics partially because I felt that my background would give me a unique edge that could help this industry.  I have experienced firsthand some of the difficulties doing business in the North can entail, and I can promise you that I am personally ready to work with you, and have my departments working to enhance the programs and services that will support your ventures. The Government of the Northwest Territories has a unique approach to mineral exploration and development in the NWT.  It is based on the fundamental fact that northerners want new mines, our economy needs new mines, and we all want them done in a way which reflects our territory’s values.  The approach is built on partnerships with industry stakeholders and the Indigenous governments that make up our territory, and is built on mutual respect and the recognition that each of us can contribute to the success of the others, to maximize benefits for all.  Through Socio-Economic Agreements established by our government with mining companies and 25 years of working together, we have built a made-in-the-NWT workforce and service sector. Our people are seeing a real and tangible reason to stay in school and pursue higher learning.  They are doing more than taking on labour jobs. They are going to skilled trade schools and universities, and coming home schooled in mining related fields like heavy duty mechanics, engineering and geosciences.  Our Indigenous governments own and operate the companies that service the mines.  This has built a strong indigenous business community. They own construction, logistics, transportation and now mining companies.  Some have even expanded from our territory to service industry in Alberta and across Canada."
383,2020-03-01,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-launch-canadian-minerals-and-metals-action-plan-pdac,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Launch of Canadian Minerals and Metals Action Plan at PDAC,"Check against delivery  Good afternoon, and welcome again to everyone.   Before I start, I’d like to welcome my Ministerial counterparts and all the stakeholders and Indigenous representation both in the audience and on stage with us this afternoon.  This is my first PDAC experience as Minister of ITI and Infrastructure, and I am pleased that my first PDAC speaking engagement is at an important one like this.  Announcements like the one today, demonstrate the influence that strong partnerships can make. Together, these kinds of partnerships are leading the way back to prosperity in the NWT, across the North and for all of Canada.  The Northwest Territories is acutely aware of how critical it is that Canada continues to be a recognized world leader in sustainable and respectful mineral development, and exploration. I have said it before, that collaboration will improve our collective fortunes, and I believe the coming together in support of this Action Plan, demonstrates this is one of the pieces that will guide us to that goal.  This action plan builds on the framework set by the Strategy that was released exactly one year ago, and I want to thank the Government of Canada for its work in setting the course.  It identifies a way for us to speak with one voice as we attract investment from across the globe.   It is our roadmap to partnership at all levels of government to further geoscience research which can bring more attention to mineral potential and the resource-rich land, we call home.  It is a guide to increasing our investments in innovation which will keep Canada on the cutting-edge in the mineral industry, and it is a call to take leadership on climate change, while still using the strength of our resources to build a sustainable future.  The Northwest Territories will do its part to see this action plan through, and will continue to work with our partners to collaborate and share our strengths.   It is my hope that this action plan will also feed into other priorities essential to realizing our mineral prosperity.   Priorities projects like the Taltson expansion project, and Slave Geological Province Corridor, both of which will help connect resource-rich regions of the NWT to markets, help green the mining industry, and lower operating costs.  Investment’s in Canada’s North are investments for all Canadians, and I look forward to Canada’s continued support in realizing these transformative projects.   Thank you again to the leadership of Natural Resources Canada, and our partner province and territories, towards this shared path forward.  I am excited to work with all our partners to realize our vision of Canada as a leaders in mining. "
384,2020-02-28,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-taking-next-steps-nwt-film-and-media,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Taking the Next Steps in NWT Film and Media,"Mr. Speaker, each year the Dead North Film Festival inspires people from across the Arctic to get out and shoot short film creations in the depths of winter. It also brings Northerners together to support the film sector and have fun at this horror and fantasy genre event.  This year marks the eighth year for the Dead North Film Festival.  The GNWT’s Film Commission, in the Department of Industry, Tourism, and Investment, has been a supporter and sponsor from the beginning.  The annual festival has become a staple in the Yellowknife film calendar, providing professionals and newcomers alike the chance to dip their toes in the creative economy. Since Dead North was established in 2012, over 170 short films have been produced, and audiences come out in droves to see the results. As the NWT’s presence on the global film industry continues to grow, this northern event has also become a jumping-off point for the participation of NWT productions in southern festival tours.   Mr. Speaker, this year’s submissions for the Dead North Film Festival set a new record and I would like to congratulate the festival’s founders and organizers, the Artless Collective for their vision, the work they have done, and the success that they have enjoyed.  As this year’s Dead North Film Festival wraps up this weekend, I encourage Members to get out and take in the screenings and events.  I would also like to use this opportunity to update Members on the work and investments we are undertaking to create even more opportunities for our film and media industry.  Five years ago, Mr. Speaker, the NWT Film Commission launched Take One, the territory’s first film strategy.  Through its implementation and our own government investments, the NWT has become known for award-winning films, circumpolar festivals, and one of a kind story telling.  Last year, the NWT Film Rebate Program leveraged almost $2.3 million in economic spending in the Northwest Territories.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to update our film strategy, and to take the next big step in the development of our creative economy.  To do this, the department has launched the Let’s Talk Film and Media campaign to consider what the next phase of film and media growth in our territory should look like. Together, with the NWT Professional Media Association, Industry, Tourism and Industry will be hosting a visioning workshop with representatives from across the NWT’s film sector.  We’re reaching out to leaders, municipalities, and stakeholders across the North to get their input. Through an online idea board and discussion forums, we have started a territory-wide conversation with NWT residents about film and media development in our territory.    Mr. Speaker, in this government’s mandate, we have highlighted the importance of increasing economic diversification by supporting growth in non-extractive sectors. Collectively, our vision is for a territory where there is rewarding work available for NWT residents across all sectors, and this includes film. Our territory is home to a vibrant screen-based media production industry built upon the dedicated efforts of both local and guest producers committed to telling our stories to the world. The product of their work and passion does more than generate employment and spending for actors, technical staff, and suppliers of goods and services. It also helps to showcase our incredible landscapes, cultures, traditions, and iconic landmarks to the world. When it was introduced in 2015, the GNWT’s first-ever film strategy established two broad goals for the actions and investments it identified: Increase the number and quality of local independent film and television production with market interest; and  Increase the number of guest productions that engage NWT residents and their services.  With success on both fronts, it is time to advance our growing industry to the next level.  In the coming weeks, Mr. Speaker, Members may see or receive messages on their social media platforms saying: Let’s talk Film and Media.  I encourage you to join the conversation, and to share the opportunity with your constituents, so that together we can share ideas on what the future of film and media looks like in the NWT.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
385,2020-02-28,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-payment-invoices,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Payment of Invoices,"Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories wants NWT businesses to flourish. For small businesses in particular, prompt payment of invoices is critical to their financial health. As Minister, I can assure you that the Department of Finance places a high value on maintaining a positive working relationship with the companies the GNWT does business with. The Financial and Employee Shared Services, or FESS,  is the division responsible for processing and issuing payment for all supplier invoices for goods and services provided to all GNWT departments, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation, and as of last month, the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority. FESS’s goal is to process payment for all suppliers within 20 to 30 days of receiving an invoice. Over the past couple of months, FESS has looked into the reasons why some payments are delayed. We have learned that changes that were made to how we process invoices may be causing unnecessary delays. In the past, suppliers sent their invoices directly to the GNWT departments and agencies they provided the goods and services to, rather than one central source. Over time, this shift has likely led to some confusion among suppliers on who they should be forwarding their invoices to, as well as uncertainty within departments and agencies on what to do when they receive an invoice. Mr. Speaker, it is the responsibility of the Department of Finance to make sure that suppliers clearly understand our processes, as well as how to access support when they encounter issues. As a response, the Department has updated its website to make certain that key information suppliers need is easily available, including: where and how to send invoices, what information is required for speedy processing, and how to sign up for direct deposit instead of waiting for a cheque to be delivered through the mail.  Within the coming months, we will also be sending resources directly to our suppliers to ensure that they are familiar with our processes and know who to contact when they need support. We will also ensure that employees in the departments and agencies supported by Financial and Employee Shared Services know that they should forward any invoices they receive without delay. Communications to vendors is one step in the process. We must also ensure that we are able to meet our internal processing deadlines. As you are aware, with the onboarding of the NTHSSA, the volume for FESS increased and as with any change, there are dips in production. We are continuing to monitor this and over time we will see these numbers pick back up. Mr. Speaker, I am confident that enhanced communication from the Department of Finance to our suppliers, and within our Government, continued monitoring of workflows and internal streamlining of processes, will help to address our suppliers’ concerns about payment delays, and we will continue to monitor this situation to ensure that all invoices are paid within our 20 to 30 day target. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
386,2020-02-27,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-round-round,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Round-up of Round up,"Mr. Speaker, the 19th Legislative Assembly has identified increasing resource exploration and development for the benefit of the people of the Northwest Territories, as a priority for this government. In January, I attended the Association for Mineral Exploration Roundup in Vancouver with Premier Cochrane, Minister Thompson and staff from the departments of Infrastructure, Industry, Tourism and Investment, Environment and Natural Resources, Executive and Indigenous Affairs, and Lands in an effort to advance the interests of the NWT and work towards attaining this goal. We often talk about the benefits mines bring to a territory.  Our mines are huge operations requiring numerous products and services, and large, diverse workforces.  This means economic opportunities and benefits that begin to flow to NWT residents long before mines even open, in exploration activity and geoscience research spurred by the search for precious stones and minerals.  This is the focus of Roundup.  It is one of Canada’s largest mining conferences that draws delegates from around the world, including GNWT staff representing a number of departments, and representatives from NWT Indigenous governments and development corporations. It is an event that I first attended as an engineering student at UBC, and it was then, and continues to be today an important opportunity to promote our resource potential and strong partnership model to those who want to work with us to sustain and enhance our economy.   Mr. Speaker, exploration spending in our territory is projected to have decreased again last year to around $78 million. In past years, it has been as high as $150 to 200 million.  It is a critical investment that is missing in our economy.  This is something that we have already said needs to be a priority for our government.   It is money that is spent on helicopters, equipment, camps and supplies. If exploration companies need it, they buy it and NWT companies are the benefactors.   Just like the mines that they precede, exploration crews and logistics companies also hire locally, not just geologists and geophysicists, but expediters, line cutters, stakers, cooks, technicians, camp attendants, ramp hands, cleaners, and labourers. Mr. Speaker, our government’s approach for this year’s Roundup was to highlight the enormous potential that exists for those willing to be a part of responsible development in our territory; and to demonstrate, in tangible terms, the partnerships that we believe will realize new exploration opportunities.  We set the stage for our attendance this year by introducing an updated bedrock geology map and database for the mineral-rich Slave Geological Province, which is well known for its excellent mineral potential and the long, prosperous history of mining. On the Sunday preceding Roundup, Premier Cochrane helped to launch an exciting new partnership for our North. Backed by the Government of Canada and supported by Canada’s three territorial governments, the Invest Canada North Initiative will see a robust presence from northern Canada at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada Convention, taking place in Toronto next week, that will focus  exclusively on promoting investment opportunities in Canada’s North to national and international audiences.  As the business of Roundup got under way, two important media events showcased our territory’s innovation and leadership in partnered, Indigenous-led resource development.  I want to recognize the leadership of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, Det’on Cho Corporation, and Cheetah Resources. Their agreement to begin Canada’s first rare earth mining project, with the first Indigenous-led mine site, could be a game changer, not just for our territory, but our country. I also want to congratulate the Gwich’in Tribal Council and Inuvialuit Regional Corporation again for the release of their regional mineral development strategies. These strategies will serve both as roadmaps for mineral explorers and action plans for Indigenous governments as they seek to attract investment on their terms. Mr. Speaker, there were also a number of formal meetings and informal networking events during Roundup where the Premier, Minister Thompson and I spoke to the priority that our government will be giving to revitalizing exploration and development in our territory.  We highlighted our continuing work to impement new mineral legislation, updated industry representatives on transformative infrastructure projects that are taking shape, and listened proactively to concerns that were raised by our partners.  At every step, Mr. Speaker, we were able to point to economic reconciliation in action.  Our ongoing work with Indigenous governments was alongside of us, clearly communicated as part of, and in step with, our own government’s presence. Mr. Speaker, it was a powerful message, and it served to solidify the purpose of coming out in force to events like Roundup.  We need to take tangible steps to improve the investment landscape in our territory. It’s going to take more than just one Minister, one department, or one government.  Mr. Speaker, the annual Roundup conference remains an excellent opportunity to build relationships and seek out new partnerships which will build and benefit our territory.  I am pleased with the work of the GNWT at this year’s event and confident that in addition to highlighting our political support for this sector, that we were also able to demonstrate that the 19th Legislative Assembly is committed to reaching goals and making decisions in a more transparent and collaborative manner.   I look forward to our government building on these successes at Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada Convention and through the Invest Canada North initiative that begins this Sunday in Toronto, and will be happy to update the House and the public of those successes in the near future.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   "
387,2020-02-27,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-airport-improvements,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Airport Improvements,"Mr. Speaker, making strategic investments in our transportation system is one of the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly. Investing in airport improvements will keep our communities connected while reducing the cost of living and supporting economic opportunities. Given our vast territory and dispersed communities, air travel is essential for Northern residents, businesses, and tourists.  The Government of the Northwest Territories manages 27 public airports that support vital services including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, forest fire response, and much more. Investing in our airports not only improves the delivery of safe and efficient transportation, but also provides jobs, skills, training, and beneficial economic opportunities for communities and residents. In fact, a total of 158 Northerners are directly employed through our airports. This does not include jobs created through special projects, such as capital construction projects.  Mr. Speaker, today, I am pleased to provide an update on airport improvement projects throughout the Northwest Territories.  Beginning in Inuvik, there are three major projects planned for the Mike Zubko Airport.  These include: A new air terminal building; Improvements to help protect permafrost and improve runway drainage; and The design of an extension to the existing runway. When the new air terminal building is completed, travellers will notice an improved passenger experience and an airport that better fits their needs. This includes upgraded public spaces, baggage systems, food concessions, airline operations, and improved accessibility. The Government of the Northwest Territories is working to keep the public informed and to provide opportunities for dialogue with residents and businesses. This month the Department of Infrastructure held two public meetings and one contractor meeting in Inuvik to discuss the new Air Terminal Building. The project is already providing a boost to local employment, as a local business was contracted to demolish the pre-existing hangar on the build site. Construction of the new Air Terminal Building is expected to be complete as soon as 2023. The second project at the Inuvik Airport will result in airfield upgrades to protect permafrost and improve drainage. A total of $22 million in federal and territorial funding was announced last year for this project under the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund. This project will make the airport more resilient to the effects of climate change, one of the priorities of this Legislative Assembly. The runway and taxiway embankments will be reconstructed, to better protect the permafrost under the airport. Surface drainage improvements will also help direct water away from vulnerable areas. Design work for the airfield improvement projects is currently underway and is expected to be completed this fall. Once the design has been finalized, construction is expected to take approximately two years. Mr. Speaker, design work begins this summer on the Inuvik Airport runway extension project. Last year the federal government announced funding of up to $150 million for the project. This funding will be spread out over five years and will deliver major upgrades, including extending the length of the runway from 6,000 to 9,000 feet long. The project includes modernizing the lighting, navigational, and military aircraft landing arrestor systems. This investment will support a greater variety of military aircraft, while reducing the strain on aircraft that already serve the airport. The runway extension will help increase Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic, and benefit local travelers and businesses that rely on this airport. Mr. Speaker, for many communities across the North, air travel is an essential service. For this reason, airport maintenance and improvement activities are particularly important to ensure safe and efficient travel. With this in mind, the Department of Infrastructure is also completing work at some of our smaller airports. For example, we are undertaking drainage improvements at Sachs Harbour, Aklavik, Hay River, and Sambaa K’e airports. This work will increase the resiliency of these airports to the effects of climate change. Mr. Speaker, improvements are also ongoing at the Yellowknife Airport. As the largest and busiest aviation gateway to the North, Yellowknife Airport continues to focus on improvements for travellers as well as new economic opportunities. The airport recently transitioned to common-use terminals, which will allow airlines to share counter space based on flight schedules, creating increased flexibility and better use of the check-in area. Upgrades were also recently completed to the baggage system and security screening areas of the airport, underscoring our commitment to a safe and secure facility. Mr. Speaker, in addition to improvements to the passenger experience, the airport has been busy making operational improvements. While not always visible to the public, these investments are crucial to the safe and efficient operation of airports. To help define long-term goals at the Yellowknife Airport, a 20-Year Master Plan will be finalized in the coming months.  In addition to these improvements at the Yellowknife Airport, our government is also pursuing economic opportunities related to cold-weather testing. Most recently, Airbus chose the Yellowknife Airport to test their newest aircraft: the Airbus A220. Our frigid temperatures make us the perfect destination for this type of testing. The A220 is already certified to minus 35 Celsius, but Airbus wants to certify the jet for minus 40 Celsius, which is why they brought it to Yellowknife. Airbus officials indicated the weather was ideal during their visit, and I thank the many Northern businesses and support groups who worked to make this opportunity possible. Going forward, the airport is focused on attracting more cold-weather testing opportunities. To support this, a dedicated working group has been established at the airport to provide resources and assist aeronautical decision-makers. Through this group’s work, the NWT can provide a wealth of knowledge for companies looking to test their equipment in the North.  Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories will continue to invest in all of our airports. By working closely with communities and the federal government to secure funding, we will keep our communities connected while supporting opportunities for Northerners. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

It sounds like you all had a full day yesterday, which I hope you found productive and inspiring.  I’m grateful for the chance to speak to all of you, and thank you in person for the incredible work you do. Keeping the land healthy is a priority for the Government of the Northwest Territories. Not just our natural environment, of course, but also our connection to the land. That’s why our communities are at the heart of conservation planning in the Northwest Territories. By protecting the areas that are important to our communities, we can help maintain our natural and cultural resources for generations to come. The conservation network in the NWT is diverse and evolving, and I am excited about upcoming opportunities. Yesterday, you talked about Indigenous guardian programs and ways to get more of our youth out on the land, and connecting to their culture. These kinds of programs are near to my heart, as they help to revitalize and strengthen our communities. Today you’ll hear about other ways protected areas can support communities to develop and diversity their local economy, through culture, education, tourism and recreation. Building a more diverse economy and creating jobs in small communities are priorities for the GNWT. As you know, sustainability is key. That’s why we continue to look for long-term funding options for our NWT protected areas. All of these conversations will help ensure we are building a conservation network that respects and protects the values of our communities and Indigenous partners. It is up to all of us to ensure our newly-established protected areas can fulfill their promise of contributing to social wellbeing, ecological health, sustainable livelihoods and economic prosperity. I look forward to continuing to work together to protect our land and northern way of life.  Thank you, and please enjoy the rest of the gathering.      "

The NWT Association of Communities represents all 33 of the NWT’s incorporated communities.  Together they are an effective voice for community governments.  The NWTAC promotes the exchange of information among community governments, working together to reach collective goals.  The NWT Association of Communities will host their 2020 Annual General Meeting in Inuvik from February 27th until the 29th.   Mr. Speaker, this is a time of complex changes in the world, especially with the effects of climate change that we are experiencing in the North.  Appropriately, a theme for the AGM this year is Managing Change.  Mr. Doug Griffiths has been invited as a keynote speaker and will share his knowledge and experience in helping communities identify challenges and develop solutions to become successful during times of change.   This year there will be an interactive session focused on Healthy Communities and the Social Determinants of Health, sponsored by the Department of Health and Social Services.  This collaborative opportunity will be followed by a Healthy Living Fair. I am excited to note that the formal AGM will wrap up with a discussion with the Cabinet. This session has historically been very popular with community representatives and I am pleased to share Cabinet will be in attendance. In addition, leading up to the AGM, MACA and the NWTAC are collaborating to offer Mayors and Chiefs the opportunity to attend the second annual Mayors and Chiefs Bootcamp on the 25th and 26th , and training for elected officials on the 27th prior to the start of the AGM later in the afternoon.   This year’s Bootcamp is about building relationships to help navigate the everyday challenges of governance.  The focus of the Elected Officials Training is in the process of being finalized but topics being considered include addressing the media, fraud prevention and forensic audits and the importance of these actions. On behalf of the GNWT, I wish the NWT Association of Communities well with their upcoming AGM and training opportunities.  I look forward to being part of the discussions and hearing from communities to better understand their priorities and concerns. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
390,2020-02-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-tlicho-all-season-road,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road,"Mr. Speaker, making strategic infrastructure investments that connect communities, expand the economy, and reduce the cost of living is a priority of this government. Infrastructure projects bring skills, training, and economic opportunities to our communities and their residents. Infrastructure plays a very important role in the longevity and health of the people of the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, during the last Assembly, the government completed work on the Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk Highway with the grand opening occurring just two years ago. This award winning project has had a huge impact on the region, helping to connect communities and increase the tourism potential of the Beaufort Delta. This past September, construction began on another new highway project: the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road and today I am happy to provide Members with an update.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that work on the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road is both ahead of schedule and on-budget. As of December, embankment construction had been completed for the first 36 kilometres, along with a number of culverts and drainage ditches. The project is scheduled for substantial completion by November 2021, and final completion in the fall of 2022. When the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road opens, this two-lane gravel highway will cover a distance of 97 kilometres and provide year-round access from Highway number 3 to Whatı̀. This project will help to connect communities; support employment and training opportunities; increase our territory’s resiliency to climate change; and create new social and economic opportunities.  Already, we are seeing the benefits this project is having for our residents and communities.  By December 2019, close to six thousand hours of cumulative training had already taken place through the Tłı̨chǫ Resident Training program. This includes training in job readiness, heavy equipment operation, camp cooking, and first aid. As well, as of December 2019, 137 workers were working on site. Nearly half of these workers are Northwest Territories’ residents, including 35 per cent who are Tłı̨chǫ Citizens. Approximately 40 per cent of business contracts for this project have also gone to Northern businesses. Mr. Speaker, the GNWT is working closely with the Tłı̨chǫ Government on this project. The Tłı̨chǫ Government is an equity partner in North Star Infrastructure, with whom the GNWT has a Public-Private Partnership, or P3, Project Agreement to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain the road. As demonstrated through projects such as the Mackenzie Valley Fibre Link, P3s can be a successful way to advance major projects while achieving the best value for money for the government and taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that in November, the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road was one of five projects to be recognized by the prestigious Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships.  As one of the first P3s in North America with an Indigenous government holding a cash-funded equity stake, the project won gold in the National Awards for Innovation and Excellence in Public-Private Partnerships.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our P3 Partners, both the Tłı̨chǫ Government, and Kiewit Canada Development Company, on this significant achievement. Mr. Speaker, investing in public infrastructure is a core responsibility of government that benefits our residents and supports economic development across the territory.  In the long-term, the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road is expected to reduce the cost of living for the region and support new social opportunities, while helping to attract additional interest from industry in the exploration and development of natural resources.  This highway continues to be a priority for the GNWT and the Tłı̨chǫ. I will continue to provide updates as we progress through the project timelines and look forward to the day when our residents can drive to and from Whatı̀ all year round, not just during the winter.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
391,2020-02-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-pink-shirt-day,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Pink Shirt Day,"Check Against Delivery  Mr. Speaker, no one in the Northwest Territories, especially our children and youth, should ever have to endure bullying. Our schools and communities must be safe spaces for all students and the responsibility to ensure this happens is one we all share. I am pleased to announce today, on Pink Shirt Day, the formal release of the Guidelines for Ensuring LGBTQ2S+ Equity, Safety and Inclusion in Northwest Territories Schools. In 2007, Nova Scotia teenagers David Shepherd and Travis Price organized a protest after a male grade 9 student in their school was harassed for wearing a pink shirt. The next morning, these two youth brought pink shirts to hand out to all the male students. Their school was full of kids in pink that day. Thirteen years later, Pink Shirt Day has become a global call to action as schools and workplaces around the world are flooded with pink in solidarity against bullying. The national theme for 2020 is Lift Each Other Up, and I am happy to see so much pink around the House today, as we stand together on Pink Shirt Day. Across the Northwest Territories, we have worked with our education and community partners to combat bullying. As I am sure all Members of this House are aware, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer/Questioning, and Two-Spirit youth, or LGBTQ2S+, experience greater discrimination compared to their heterosexual and cis-gender peers. They have higher instances of mental health issues, substance abuse, lack of school attendance, violence, and suicide.  The Department of Education, Culture, and Employment is aware of the unique challenges that LGBTQ2S+ students face in school, at home, and in their community. Research shows that having strong anti-bullying policies and guidelines result in lower levels of bullying victimization, greater school safety, and less social aggression. As well, students in schools that run Genders and Sexualities Alliances, or GSAs, are at a lower threat for risky behaviours, like alcohol and substance use. They also report increased psychological well-being and function.   Mr. Speaker, the department is committed to supporting diversity among school staff, students and families. As a part of Education Renewal and Innovation, the Guidelines for Ensuring LGBTQ2S+ Equity, Safety and Inclusion align with the Safe Schools Regulations, the Territorial Schools Code of Conduct, the Northwest Territories Human Rights Act and the Government of the Northwest Territories Harassment Free and Respectful Workplace Policy. There are 13 promising practices that can be integrated into any school.  These practices are evidence-based, tangible calls to action, through collaboration with the Rainbow Coalition of Yellowknife, FOXY, and SMASH, and with feedback from our education partners.  Some of the most valuable insight in the Guidelines came from youth who attended the first Rainbow Youth Conference in 2017. LGBTQ2S+ and ally students across the North developed music, visual art, spoken word poetry, and videos featuring messages of inclusion and support. The students shared their ideas on what needs to happen to ensure their schools are respectful, caring and safe for everyone.  We will be hosting the second Rainbow Youth Conference this spring, and sharing the new Guidelines with the students. Community and Territorial leaders will also have the opportunity to hear their stories at the Lunch with Leaders; I hope you all attend. I truly hope the students see themselves in the work and know that their input has helped break down barriers to understanding.  Mr. Speaker, Northwest Territories schools should be safe and caring environments for the entire school community. With the release of the Guidelines, the continued education and wellness partnerships, and most of all, the individuals and groups paving the way for inclusion and equity, I believe our schools can be the places of change where we respect each other’s differences, and recognize our similarities.   Mahsı, Mr. Speaker."
392,2020-02-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-strategic-oil-and-gas-receivership-process,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Strategic Oil and Gas Receivership Process,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, Strategic Oil and Gas Limited or “Strategic“ filed for creditor protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act in April 2019. Strategic operates the Cameron Hills, Northwest Territories Project which includes winter access roads, well sites, oil and gas gathering systems, a small pipeline, an oil and gas battery, a permanent camp and various incidental activities such as borrow pits, permanent bridges and sump sites.  The Government of the Northwest Territories has been monitoring and intervening in the ongoing court process to help ensure Northwest Territories interests are represented.  A receiver has been appointed by the Court to oversee the Northwest Territories’ assets of Strategic. The receiver, Alvarez and Marsal, is to take temporary custody of Strategic’s assets in the Northwest Territories, address regulatory obligations and attempt to sell the Northwest Territories assets, if possible. The proceeds of any sales will be used to cover regulatory obligations, and pay the company’s creditors.   In the Northwest Territories, the immediate regulatory obligations are to repair and suspend a leaking well, and suspend two other wells, by April 1, 2020.  There is currently enough money through existing securities to do this work and bring the site into compliance. Until the receivership process has been completed, it is impossible to say what the final costs to remediate the site might be, or who would be responsible for covering them. Strategic’s project was approved in 2010, before devolution.  At the time it was transferred to the GNWT, Strategic’s site was in operation and its permits were in order. The Government of the Northwest Territories had a reasonable expectation that it would continue its operations until it was wound down according to regulatory requirements.   While it is too early to predict the outcome of the ongoing receivership process, the Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to protecting the Northwest Territories’ land and environment and ensuring appropriate remediation is carried out on Strategic’s sites in the Northwest Territories.   Our government’s work to strengthen and improve the Northwest Territories regulatory framework continues, including ongoing work on how we calculate the amount of security we recommend to regulatory boards. The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to managing development responsibly and protecting the Northwest Territories’ land and environment, through careful regulation of future projects, and taking appropriate responsibility for the consequences of past projects when necessary. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

We have a vast geography, a wealth of resources and a population strengthened by incredible diversity. The 19th Legislative Assembly wants to see the Northwest Territories make the best possible use of all of our opportunities and resources, including the strength of our people, to achieve the 22 priorities that were set by all 19 members of this Assembly. These priorities stretch across all of our communities and are our shared vision for economic growth, environmental stewardship and a healthy and better educated population. Achieving these priorities will be a continuing journey that will outlast the life of the 19th Assembly and this government must make decisions in a way that looks beyond four years to the next generation. We have a responsibility to put the Northwest Territories on a good path using our priorities as a guide and establishing a budget and a fiscal plan to achieve as much distance towards these priorities as possible. It has been said that it is easier to destroy than to create. Think about an ice sculpture. Creating takes time. It requires patience. It succeeds with thoughtfulness and planning. This government wants to create a positive path forward for the future. Budget 2020 is a first step on a path towards our priorities, one for which we build relationships within our government, with our communities, and between governments. This Budget proposes to spend almost $1.9 billion on programs and services in the coming year and sets out further fiscal steps that will support progress on all 22 priorities. This Budget is a foundation upon which we will create and build. Shortly, I will review the Northwest Territories economic situation and outlook. I will describe some key drivers in our economy as well as some of our challenges. Next, I will discuss our fiscal situation and strategy, which speaks to some of the direct impacts that government can have toward positively influencing our economic situation. I will then describe our planned revenues and expenditures for the next fiscal year and conclude with a discussion about next steps for the financial health and planning of the Northwest Territories. I want to make two comments about how this Budget was prepared. First, this Budget was a collective effort. It stretches back to the last Assembly when departments were working on their plans for the coming year. We are always building on work from prior assemblies in a consensus government. In the relatively short time of four months since this Cabinet was formed, we have tried to chart a more inclusive approach to financial policy setting that better engages all Members. It is my intention to continue establishing opportunities throughout our processes for public dialogue and engagement with this Assembly. Evidence based decision making requires information and perspectives and potential decisions should, where possible, be vetted by those impacted. I want to thank all Members of this Assembly for their constructive ideas and work in building our financial plan for the next fiscal year and beyond. Second, in preparing this Budget we needed to take a realistic look at our fiscal challenges. Our immediate fiscal situation is not what was hoped in the last budget but it is manageable. We are not in a crisis. This is a time for cautious optimism. Achieving the priorities of this Assembly will require a disciplined approach and a plan to ensure that we are getting value for the money we are spending while preserving the ability to responsibly fund infrastructure needs in our communities and across the territory. Although this is next fiscal year’s operating budget, the revenues projected in this Budget must also partially pay for the 2020-21 capital budget that was approved last fall. More important, we must remember that we are on a longer journey and the first step taken in today’s Budget sets the direction for the financial plan over the next four years. Within our Budget we remain committed to responsible fiscal management. Just as this Budget is meant to provide a stable starting point for the future of the 19th Assembly within a context of change, our approach to financial management is changing progressively to deliver a better product to serve the goals of this government. Part of this change includes the use of four-year business plans, instead of an isolated annual version each year. We will regularly return to the business plan to evaluate our progress and performance so that we will know if we are getting the results and value we expect for the money we spend. We will also be focusing resources to improve evaluation and monitoring of key performance measures across sectors and programs. Many of the programs and services that government delivers cannot be measured purely by numbers. Much of what we do provides a social return that is going to need a more nuanced measure. Our goal is to ensure not only that residents of the Northwest Territories get the best monetary value for their dollar but that they get a positive social, cultural, educational, health and economic return on our collective investment.   Economic Outlook The financial foundation for all our priorities is a vibrant and diverse economy. The Macroeconomic Policy Framework is a set of measures used to assess the territory’s economic performance over time. It shows the economy has not recovered to its pre-recession peak in 2007. We know that circumstances have changed since then. Political and economic uncertainty across the world can significantly impact our small resource-based economy. In 2019, the Northwest Territories economy is expected to have shrunk 4.3 per cent, due to declines in diamond production and private-sector investment. Increases in government investment expenditures helped cushion the slowdown in private sector activity and saved the economy from a more severe decline. Government infrastructure investments are the prime driver in a 3.4 per cent increase in total private and public investment from 2019 to 2020. This year, economic growth is expected to improve, with real gross domestic product forecast to increase 3.8 per cent. However, this growth will only partially offset the real GDP decline from 2019, leaving the economy still smaller than it was two years ago. In short, the Northwest Territories economy is stable, but it is not growing. Economic stability does not describe the longer term outlook. The diamond mining industry has been our economic engine for the last two decades. However, the industry has matured, and all existing Northwest Territories diamond mines could be closed by 2030, with the first one ceasing operations within the next five years. Possible expansions may allow one or more of the diamond mines to continue to operate, but that remains uncertain just as there is no certainty of finding new economically viable deposits. The closure of the diamond mines will result in a large drop in economic output and there are no other confirmed projects on the horizon large enough to fill this gap. The role government can play in supporting economic growth should not be underestimated. Strategic infrastructure investments are key to supporting future economic growth and to supporting our people to be drivers of that growth. The Canadian economy is in the midst of re-structuring towards a more digital and service-centred economy and we want the Northwest Territories to be contributing members as this evolves. The GNWT has already invested in the basic infrastructure for a more digital economy with the Mackenzie Valley Fibre Link that gives better access to the global digital economy and countless new opportunities for Northerners. Government spending on programs, goods and services will provide stability to the economy by supporting Northern businesses, local wages, and household consumption. Public infrastructure investments such as roads, bridges, power corridors, and communications networks as well as schools, hospitals and community facilities will contribute to higher standards of living for Northerners, and to improved private sector business cases for future investments. Investing in physical and social infrastructure sets the Northwest Territories up for economic growth tomorrow. We will be guided by the principle that the expenditure of our public funds maximizes economic benefits to residents and local economies and supports Northern business.   Fiscal Situation and Outlook Mr. Speaker, our fiscal situation is not dire. However, unexpected revenue declines mean that the previous fiscal strategy objectives to increase fiscal capacity and eliminate the cash deficit were not achieved. 				We are expecting our operations budget from 2019-20 to show a deficit of $70 million. Although this is quite a distance from the $60 million operating surplus projected in last year’s budget, over one-third of the revenue loss is due to a reallocation of federal transfers for infrastructure projects from the 2019-20 fiscal year to 2020-21. In 2020-21, our operating budget is projected to show a surplus of $203 million. Over the next four years, we are currently projecting that average annual revenue growth will be greater than operating expenditure growth which allows us to project operating surpluses for the entire Assembly. However, after this year, the operating surpluses will start to decline, dropping to $147 million in 2021-22, $116 million in 2022-23 and then to $3 million in 2023-24. An operating surplus is only one part of our total financial picture. The operating budget is mainly the funding of day-to-day programs and services provided by government. The capital budget is where we show the funding of large-scale investments in infrastructure projects. Without a surplus in our operating budget, there is no cash available to put into our capital budget to pay for infrastructure investments. The less cash available from an operating surplus, the more we would have to borrow to continue to invest in capital projects. In the not too distant past, the Government of the Northwest Territories made large investments to help connect our communities with improved transportation networks such as highways, roads, bridges and airports. Large public investment has enhanced energy and communication infrastructure and built health facilities and schools. Despite these efforts, the Northwest Territories remains in a significant infrastructure deficit compared to much of the rest of Canada. Many communities have no road access, limited internet connectivity and rely on diesel to generate heat and power. Several of our communities have small and aging school facilities that accommodate only one or two teachers to cover classes from kindergarten to grade 12. The Northwest Territories’ core housing need is among the highest in Canada. Surpluses in the operating budgets are not large enough on their own to support the kind of large-scale investments we need to catch the Northwest Territories up to a similar level of infrastructure seen elsewhere in Canada. Borrowing has been and will remain necessary to make strategic infrastructure investments. Remaining fiscally responsible includes managing our debt. Our debt level is approaching the federally-imposed borrowing limit of $1.3 billion and current projections show that we will be over the limit by 2021-22. The Department of Finance uses a variety of measures to assess our debt level and ensure that we continue to use debt responsibly. We have the fiscal capacity to handle higher debt levels and discussions are underway with Finance Canada to raise the limit to provide more flexibility for long term planning.   Fiscal Strategy When it comes to developing our fiscal strategy, our focus is on the future. What we want is the ability to enhance fiscal resources to advance the 22 priorities of this Assembly. First, using today’s current estimates, the Fiscal Strategy provides an initial allocation of $25 million over the life of the 19th Assembly to advance towards our mandate priorities, starting with $10 million in 2020-21. Over the next few weeks we will be working with Members to allocate this funding. Second, we will continue to build on our relationship with the federal government to take advantage of funding opportunities to advance our priorities, such as housing investments. We will also be looking for more flexibility than the usual 75/25 approach to cost-sharing. Third, we will seek opportunities for collaboration with other governments to advance shared priorities. This government does not want to compete for resources with other organizations within the Northwest Territories. We will work with Indigenous Governments across the Northwest Territories to advance projects that benefit all of our people. Finally, we are looking for creative low or no cost initiatives to improve fiscal planning, including four-year business plans, to bring the longer-term horizon into view and will rely on increased program evaluation to bring more value for our dollars spent.The GNWT will undertake strategic reviews to ensure programs and services are meeting expectations and that budgeted expenditures for these programs are properly aligned with our mandate and all additional revenue options are considered. Further, we are seeking an increase to the borrowing limit for better flexibility while maintaining a level of debt that is affordable. We have already begun to engage the federal government and remind them that the NWT is a fiscally responsible jurisdiction, with much opportunity but also long standing gaps. However, we can only succeed in increasing the limit if we demonstrate responsible and strategic spending. Investments will need to be modest and reflect our expected revenue growth over the next four years. From a fiscal perspective, we believe that more effective and sometimes more flexible use of our existing programs and services will provide better value for the public money that we are spending. We expect to improve performance while reducing costs so that we can free up fiscal resources to help close the infrastructure gap that exists across our communities without overreliance on debt.   Tax Measures The cost of living is high in the territory, especially within small communities where average incomes are lower. Budget 2020 introduces no new taxes. We will be reviewing our tax regime in tandem with Standing Committee and we are developing a plan to engage the people of the Northwest Territories in a dialogue about government revenues. Together we will continue to explore ways to increase our own-source revenues without an undue burden on our residents and businesses. The Northwest Territories is at the forefront of climate change, with the impacts of rising average global temperatures being more pronounced here than in other parts of the world, affecting permafrost, ice road seasons, and forest fires. Carbon pricing was developed as a response to the federal proposal and implemented as part of a made-in-the-North approach to encourage greenhouse gas reductions. Effective July 1, federally mandated carbon tax rates will increase to $30 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions as part of our legislated commitment to carbon pricing under the Pan-Canadian Framework. This means a tax rate increase of 2.3 cents per litre on gasoline and 2.7 cents per litre on diesel fuel. In lock step with the carbon tax increase, the Cost of Living Offset will increase to $156 per year for an individual and $180 per year for a child on July 1. The Cost of Living Offset payments are made quarterly, except for single individuals who will receive a lump sum in July because their quarterly payments would be less than $50. Budget 2020 proposes almost $11 million in spending for residents and businesses for the Cost of Living Offset, heating rebates, large emitters’ rebates and grants, and rebates for electricity producers to mitigate the impact on the cost of living due to the carbon tax.   Expenditures Mr. Speaker, we propose to spend $1.896 billion in this Budget. We mapped out the proposed budget starting with the blueprint of last year’s budget. Departments worked hard to find $15 million to reallocate. We also partnered with the federal government for $29 million in new federal funding for some projects. This effort gives us the flexibility to fund $94 million in additional spending. We are investing $39 million of this new spending in our public service to conclude the last collective bargaining agreements. The remainder of the additional funds are proposed to adjust department budgets to better match their spending needs, to deliver on partnership agreements with Canada and to add $6 million in funds for initiatives started in the last Assembly. Based on current fiscal forecasts we will set aside at least $25 million over the term of this government to advance this Assembly’s priorities. The proposed amount for 2020-21 will be submitted through a supplementary appropriation after the Main Estimates have been approved by the Assembly. We will be more collaborative and more strategic in how we approach delivering on our Mandate that comes from this Assembly’s priorities. Providing quality health care and social services that are comparable to what other Canadians receive will always be a key consideration in budget planning. The Department of Health and Social Services has a proposed budget of over half a billion dollars with $18 million of enhancements and adjustments introduced this year. Budget 2020 includes $10 million for supporting well-being through the recently amended Northern Wellness Agreement with the federal government. This means more health and wellness programming in our communities in collaboration with Indigenous Services Canada. With the opening of the Stanton Territorial Hospital last year, we have created a facility that will serve us for many years and will be administered through an agreement with Boreal Health Partners. More functions are becoming operational, and Budget 2020 proposes adding $2.6 million for a wide range of operations in ongoing funding. This funding will support 51 positions to help patients, including 15 behavioural health workers, nine positions in the medicine unit, five staff for processing medical devices, four positions in each of the emergency triage department and day procedures units, and three for rehabilitation services. Through partnership and collaboration with the federal government, we are leveraging our ability to provide health care and this Budget delivers $2.1 million in spending over several areas of health. These include mental health and addictions, home and community care, cannabis awareness, emergency treatment, climate change and health adaptation, improving wellness and aftercare plans for cancer patients and survivors, supporting our participation in the Pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance, and enhanced seasonal flu monitoring. There are infrastructure deficits across all of our communities. Infrastructure includes all of the physical structures needed to support our programs and services. Our hospitals and health facilities care for people to get back on their feet. Our schools provide the space for education received by our students. Our roads allow all residents and businesses the ability to grow our economy by moving goods and labour to where they are in demand, while also allowing ambulances and first responders quick access to emergencies. Transportation links us across this territory through a network of airports and runways of not only concrete but also ice on rivers and lakes. Our laboratories, warehouses, parks, fire monitoring stations and towers, and all other government buildings and assets are ultimately to support the health, safety and well-being of our people. We have a rich, diverse and expansive terrain which creates a challenge for serving our many small communities. The territory continues to lag the rest of Canada in terms of infrastructure with the oldest average age in the country. By investing in the territory, infrastructure has the ability to lower the cost of living and develop the economy at the same time by creating multiple benefits across several sectors and departments to make the Northwest Territories a better place to live and work. The Department of Infrastructure has a proposed budget of $275 million, which includes $10 million of new spending this year. As part of a larger strategy for care, 72 new long-term care beds at the old Stanton hospital will be supported with $4 million of new funding. Proposed spending enhancements of $2.2 million provide for operations of new buildings, including the new Stanton hospital, the Hay River fish plant, biomass heating plants in schools in Hay River and Aklavik, and a laboratory and warehouse in Fort Simpson. Investment in the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway has increased the use of the Dempster Highway, Kilometer 0 to 272 of Highway 8, and Budget 2020 proposes an enhancement of $659,000 for ongoing upkeep to support people seeking adventure in our spectacular North. This Budget introduces a permafrost data management and analytical system for both highways through Transport Canada funding under the Northern Transportation Adaptation Initiative for $390,000. There is a proposed $250,000 to support the Lafferty ferry over the Liard River and Ndulee ferry over the Mackenzie River. Resources from the federal government’s Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund to address climate change will allow us to allocate $2.4 million in the Infrastructure budget, with $300,000 put towards increased funding for the Arctic Energy Alliance and its programs which would bring its total funding to $5.8 million. The remainder will go to approved projects that get underway this year. Given the investment of previous assemblies, a proposed $4.5 million is recommended for the Department of Finance for interest costs related to mainly short-term borrowing, which has advanced our ability to take advantage of cost-shared capital funding offered by the federal government to invest in the territory’s infrastructure with favourable financing. Finance, working with several other departments, is improving the way NWT residents and businesses can access government services through a better and expanded online portal that covers a range of departmental services. Budget 2020 proposes $337,000 to complete the implementation of a single, secure online portal for existing services across various departments and to bring 40 more licences and permits to the platform. The people of the Northwest Territories have a proud history as stewards of the land. We all share a responsibility to ensure our environment is healthy for present and future generations. Budget 2020 introduces additional funding of $8 million for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources within a proposed budget of almost $100 million. In an ongoing effort to establish protected areas, this Budget allocates $175,000 of additional funding to monitor more candidate protected area sites. An additional $2 million is proposed to support our forest fire suppression air tanker fleet to be better prepared for wildfire outbreaks. As part of the environmental assessment of the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway, $45,000 is proposed to fulfill commitments to support the wildlife monitoring program that will expand our understanding of the impact of roads on wildlife and can be applied to future projects. Budget 2020 allocates Environment and Natural Resources with $1.4 million for conservation and recovery of the Bathurst and Bluenose-East barren-ground caribou herds. There is $960,000 to support boreal caribou range planning in Budget 2020 under the Conservation Agreement with the federal government, with $897,000 proposed under Environment and Natural Resources and $63,000 under the Department of Lands. Budget 2020 also recommends $3.5 million in funding for advancing activities under three Challenge Nature Fund Agreements with the federal government, much of which is for the GNWT and indigenous governments to collaboratively establish, manage and monitor Thaidene Nëné and Ts’udé Niliné Tuyeta, which are new territorial protected areas and Dınàgà Wek’èhodì, which is currently a candidate protected area. These four-year agreements, with a total of $11 million in federal funding, will also support the conservation economy and job creation in small communities. Budget 2020 includes $23 million for the Department of Lands for ongoing work to manage, administer and plan for the sustainable use of public land, fairly and transparently, to reflect the interests of our people now and for generations to come. The Department of Justice delivers the Integrated Case Management program. ICM breaks down silos with project collaboration between Health and Social Services, Education, Culture and Employment, Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority staff, the Stanton hospital, and the NWT Housing Corporation. It is an example of government re-imagining existing resources to support better outcomes for people. It empowers them with knowledge and is an innovative solution that delivers results. Most of the people accepted in the program have gone through a life-changing crisis before admission and 70 per cent of them live with mental health challenges. Many program participants are referred to the program to address housing needs, a foundational aspect of the program. More than half of them are experiencing homelessness or precarious housing. Pathfinders are the backbone of the program. They work alongside clients, help navigate systems, and even sit in on appointments between clients and government service providers. The outcomes for participants are tangible, such as secure housing, as well as the intangible, such as the self-confidence it gives participants who gain greater independence once they understand how to effectively access the supports they need. ICM is also tasked with identifying barriers that participants have faced so that departments can collaborate to remove those barriers for all service users. Budget 2020 allocates $827,000 towards ongoing funding to make ICM a permanent program. The participating departments will move forward together to make the best use of the knowledge and experience about accessing government programs that is being gathered through this program. Budget 2020 also proposes $240,000 for the Victim Services Program that directs funds entirely to community-based organizations that provide victim support services. A strong education system for all stages of childhood development is one of the cornerstones on which to build the future of the Northwest Territories. Budget 2020 proposes $340 million in spending for the second largest department, Education, Culture and Employment. Budget 2020 continues to implement the Specialized Territorial Support Team for schools with $319,000 in new funding for mental health and speech and language specialists, bringing the specialist team to five members. This Budget continues to improve the Northern curricula with $129,000 of new funding to support resource development about Northern issues and to create assessment tools for credential recognition of this curricula beyond our borders for students applying for post-secondary opportunities, and also to provide training for our teachers to deliver this material. Budget 2020 also proposes an ongoing funding increase for education authorities of $269,000 for student transportation to catch up with actual expenditures. Another successful and innovative program that is expanding is Northern Distance Learning. Funding of $604,000 is proposed to bring Northern Distance Learning to five more schools and provide access to more students, as well as enhancements and funding for the equipment needed. Northern Distance Learning harnesses technology to improve student learning opportunities across all of our communities with videoconferencing and online tools linked to high schools in regional centres. The program is helping high school students achieve academic success without having to leave their home communities. To support the processing of information requests related to Day School Settlement Records, $129,000 is dedicated to a Student Records Coordinator. This coordinator will help former Day School students get the compensation to which they are entitled under the March 2019 class-action suit settlement with the federal government. The GNWT is dedicated to creating a prosperous and sustainable Northern economy and the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment has a proposed budget of $60 million to that end. Spending proposed in Budget 2020 includes an increase of $758,000. To promote economic growth, Budget 2020 is proposing $250,000 to support implementing socioeconomic agreements that will facilitate mine developments in the Dehcho and Tłı̨chǫ regions. To promote economic diversity and nurture a growing tourism sector, $176,000 is dedicated to support increased activity in the Beaufort-Delta region from Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway traffic and $92,000 is dedicated to improving public safety along the Ingraham Trail for aurora viewing in North Slave parks. The responsibility of Northern governance and decision-making often spans more than one department, and that includes offshore oil and gas negotiations. Budget 2020 puts forth $825,000 to support resource management under the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, with $705,000 allocated to the Department of the Executive and Indigenous Affairs, and $60,000 for each of Environment and Natural Resources and Industry, Tourism and Investment. The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation is proposing a total operating budget of $109.2 million in 2020-21 to support the Corporation’s mandate, which includes $4.2 million of additional spending to promote housing partnerships, homeownership and the preservation of the public housing program. During the term of the 19th Assembly, the NWTHC will continue to work with thirty-three communities toward the development of Community Housing Plans that include local and community-based strategies and solutions to guide the adaptation of existing housing, and the development of future housing in each community. Further, the NWTHC will work with people currently in Public Housing who may have the resources to become homeowners through the New Home Program and through the sale of public housing. We will also address housing affordability through the Canada Housing Benefit, a new national portable housing benefit program designed to address housing affordability. We recognize the need for an increased supply of affordable housing in the territory. To move forward we look to housing partnership programming such as the Community Housing Support Initiative that will support local and Indigenous governments and community partners in developing unique housing approaches. Additional opportunities can be found in the National Housing Co-Investment Fund, with a $60 million allocation for NWT housing projects. Recognizing the great need of people who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness, we are developing the GNWT Homelessness Strategy to ensure that GNWT investments in, and actions on, homelessness are aligned, consistent and effective.   Next Steps Having set a foundation for government operations, I would like to say a few words about our immediate next steps. The next task is to review and analyze how we use this $1.9 billion budget not only to deliver good governance day-to-day but also to advance initiatives in support of the 19th Assembly’s priorities. To do this, we will take a “whole of government” approach and try to avoid pitting one set of needs against another. We must find ways to advance all of our priorities, recognizing that different regions, communities, and people within those communities will have different needs. Recognizing and balancing the many needs of a diverse society is one of the roles of government. It is a challenge but also an opportunity to showcase consensus government by working with all Members of this Assembly. We will also be working on a more consistent approach to evaluate programs and services. All departments will be involved in performance measure development and monitoring to ensure we are getting optimal returns on our investments. We expect that a more systematic approach should help achieve more value from our expenditures and improve evaluation of our service levels. Last, but far from least, we will change the way that the government does business. There will always be risk in the world. Our government recognizes that there are risks around us and challenges ahead. We acknowledge that our economy has slowed, our fiscal resources are limited, and much of our physical and technological infrastructure still needs to catch up to the rest of Canada. National and international conditions are continuously changing. However, having acknowledged those risks and challenges, we believe that changing our approach to how to deliver government services will help us prepare for whatever new challenges the future may bring. We will not be afraid to take risks because risk is where the opportunities arise. We will not be stalled in fear that decisions, proposals, solutions, or new programs may not deliver as hoped. We will have the courage to start taking measured risks with incremental evaluation of our efforts. We will remain engaged with our residents in order to be responsive and proactive. To achieve this goal may require a cultural shift to harness the ingenuity of our public service and our communities. We will build a culture of creativity and innovation within our administration, our public service and, hopefully, across the Northwest Territories. This does not require millions of dollars of new investment, but it will take relationships built on trust, communication and respect. Fortunately, we start in a position of strength given the good work done day in and day out by our public service. This culture shift will also need to start from the top with each of us in Cabinet and in the 19th Assembly leading with integrity and courage and solving problems creatively and collaboratively. My commitment to this Assembly was a commitment to people, building relationships, and understanding the stories of others. I have learned that the budget process is a year-long endeavour and with the shift to four-year business plans it will be important to hear from different perspectives throughout our term. While the message in Budget 2020 is largely one of stability, that is not the message of the 19th Assembly. The message from this Assembly is found in its priorities and we will take measurable actions using a collaborative approach to achieve our Mandate. This Assembly is one that listens to each other and its constituents and will reach out to stakeholders for feedback. We may have differences of opinion, but these conversations are the true strength of our consensus government. Through collaboration, we will achieve more creative problem solving. With more creative problem solving, we can achieve more responsive and effective results. Establishing performance measures helps evaluate the success of our work so that our resources are used effectively. Making this approach the way we do business and govern will show the world that the Northwest Territories is a premier destination to live with a positive economic future, strong educational opportunities for our children, quality health care, a respectful approach to honouring our lands, water and wildlife, and collaborative relationships with Indigenous governments based in our commitment to reconciliation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Total revenues of $2.19 billion are expected in 2020-21, along with total expenditures of $1.98 billion, which include departmental spending, infrastructure contributions, and other items. The 2020-21 surplus is forecast to be $203 million.  Revised estimates project a 2019‑20 deficit of $70 million. Projected surpluses in the medium-term outlook are anticipated to decline to $3 million in 2023‑24.  Budget 2020 proposes a spending increase of $94 million compared to Budget 2019. This includes $61 million for program enhancements, of which $39 million reflects collective bargaining increases for departments and health authorities, and $6 million for the continued implementation of initiatives from the 18th Assembly. Another $40 million in new spending is supported by $29 million of federal transfers. Programs concluding offset new expenditures by $15 million. There are no new taxes in Budget 2020. Some fees and taxes will continue to be indexed to inflation, in keeping with the GNWT’s policy of doing so where practicable. As previously announced, the federal carbon tax will increase to $30 per tonne from $20 on July 1, 2020. Revenue from carbon pricing will continue to be recycled to NWT residents and businesses.   Quote: “Budget 2020 represents the first step in our plan to advance the 22 priorities identified by the 19th Assembly. We see today’s budget as a cautious and optimistic step forward to renew our commitment to program evaluation and better planning so that we can deliver essential programs and services more effectively. We are committed to an approach that ensures we are getting value for money while building relationships with other governments and stakeholders towards a prosperous and sustainable Northwest Territories.” - Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance   Quick Facts: Budget 2020 forecasts an operating surplus of $203 million after a $70 million projected deficit in 2019‑20. Budget 2020 will see $94 million in increased spending compared to Budget 2019: $6 million to fund ongoing measures from the 18th Legislative Assembly; $61 million to enhance or maintain existing programs; $2 million in amortization and $40 million for other spending adjustments, supported by federal transfers and $15 million in savings.  Debt will rise because capital investment is funded from the surplus and borrowing. Debt is expected to exceed the federally imposed borrowing limit of $1.3 billion by 2021-22. The GNWT’s debt level remains affordable.

Each community is accepting a pre-determined number of applicants into the program, and for two years, individuals accepted into the program will have a caregiver who is paid up to four hours each week to help them with tasks around the home and community, such as cleaning, meal preparation, hauling wood, snow removal, running errands, shopping and more.   The pilot program is underway in Behchoko and intake recently finished in Yellowknife, Dettah and N’Dilo. Planning for the communities of Hay River and Tuktoyaktuk continues and rollout will begin this spring.   Quote “This service will provide additional supports to those who need it in our communities. It will support the independence of elderly and disabled residents and build important connections between community supports and health and social services. We look forward to seeing the impact of this pilot over the coming two years, and are pleased to be offering this service to residents of the Norwest Territories.” Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services, GNWT   Quick Facts This service delivery approach will be trialed in five communities of varying sizes This will ensure we gain an understanding of how this approach supports elders and persons with disabilities in communities with different resources. This program is not meant to replace homecare or long-term care. This service option will complement existing programs. Clients can select their caregiver of choice which can be a family member or a friend. Clients can also choose a community caregiver. In both cases, the caregiver needs to be hired by the local community organization.  Caregivers will be paid to deliver support services that help individuals remain independent in their homes such as grocery shopping, snow shoveling, wood cutting, light housekeeping and meal preparation. Care provided by a professionally regulated health care provider is excluded from this service option. These types of services include, nursing care, rehabilitative care such as physiotherapy or occupational therapy, and palliative care. Paid Family/Community Caregivers are not intended to deliver or replace services that are provided by a health and social services professional. Activities of Daily Living, or ADL’s, that are provided by Home Care workers is excluded from this services option. These types of services include: personal care, medication assistance, equipment management, assisting clients with mobility needs, palliative care. The program will be piloted for two years.  Following the completion of the pilot, the program will be reviewed and considered for permanent territory-wide implementation.

398,2020-02-13,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-arctic-inspiration-prize,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Arctic Inspiration Prize,"Mr. Speaker, today I would like to highlight and celebrate recipients of the 8th Annual Arctic Inspiration Prize – Northern Compass and The Dehcho: River Journeys.  	The 8th Annual Arctic Inspiration Prize Awards Ceremony was held in Ottawa, Ontario on February 5th. At the Ceremony, Northern Compass received the grand prize of $1 million, and The Dehcho: River Journeys project received $370,000. The Arctic Inspiration Prize recognizes and promotes the extraordinary contribution made in the gathering of Arctic knowledge. It is designed to celebrate and bring further awareness to organizations and their plans to implement this knowledge to real world applications, for the benefit of the Canadian Arctic and the Arctic Peoples. I had the honor of presenting Northern Compass with their $1 million dollar prize in Ottawa last week and would like to share with you an overview of their award winning program: Northern Compass is a skilled team of educators, students and community members from across the North.  The team includes representation from a program that has been supported by the GNWT over the years, the Northern Youth Abroad program.  Northern Compass provides northern youth with tailored support and tools that will allow them to overcome the barriers that they may face when transitioning from high school to post-secondary education. 		They aim to: “Dramatically increase achievement amongst Northerners pursuing their education and career goals after high school, enabling them to become full participants in their communities and beyond”. The project motivates youth to graduate high school and make informed decisions about their future. It also provides support and increased access to training and programs that allow northern youth to pursue and achieve their goals.  Thank you to their nominator, The Honourable David Joanasie, Minister of Education, Minister of Culture and Heritage, Minister of Languages, Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.  I would like to congratulate the Team Leaders, Jim Snider, Karen Aglukark, Lois Philipp, Rebecca Bisson who have put in so much time providing accessible and relevant resources with information on funding, housing, budgeting and other areas related to our northern student’s success.  The Dehcho: River Journeys project was also a recipient of an Arctic Inspiration Award.  This project will: Travel on the Mackenzie River, from the Dehcho to the Delta, and will bridge the past and the present, offering a multi-media experience that explores how the past 100 years have transformed the River. Students will collaborate on two short films, one based on archival materials and the other chronicling a modern-day journey on the river with present-day Elders. The Elders will describe and explain the changes they have seen throughout their lives. Through this project, the development of an interactive and educational online experience will allow students to view the films and then use their new-found knowledge to resolve real-life environmental issues that plague the Mackenzie watershed today. Thank you to their nominator, Dr. Frank Tester, Professor at University of British Columbia School of Social Work.  Team Members includes: Dr. Gordon Christie, Alison de Pelham, Brian Jaffray, Terry Jaffray, Martina Norwegian, Brenda Parlee, Daniel Séguin, Sharon Snowshoe. Thank you for your work on this project and congratulations on your achievement.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Simpson: Three Phases and Upcoming Critical Milestones in the Transformation of Aurora College,"Mr. Speaker, this government has been tasked with transforming Aurora College into a polytechnic university. This work, which will span the 18th, 19th, and 20th Legislative Assemblies, is no small task, but I am here to tell you that we are well on our way. The transformation consists of over 200 projects and 2000 individual tasks. In order to be successful, we need to make the right changes, in the right order, and at the right time. To help keep things on track, the transformation is divided into three phases.  Phase 1 is focused on strengthening the foundation of the existing college, and preparing for transformation by ensuring we understand the detailed steps ahead of us. This is the phase we are currently in. Much work has already been completed in this area, much is underway, and there are some exciting and important projects that will be completed before the year is out.  This work will ensure that the College is ready to enter Phase 2, which is where the real transformational change will begin to occur. This will require wide ranging changes to the organizational structure of the College, a return to Board governance, and changes to the Aurora College Act to ensure that governance is truly at arms-length. These changes will allow us to meet and exceed the standards that the College needs to live up to in order to complete the transformation and become recognized as a polytechnic university. This final transformation will occur in Phase 3. Transparency is the key to maintaining confidence and building trust, so in the coming weeks I will deliver three Ministers statements describing each of the phases in detail, so that we can celebrate the successes we have already had, describe next steps, and let everyone know how College staff, Members of the Legislative Assembly, Indigenous governments, and the public will be able to contribute to the decisions that are made moving forward. We cannot do this alone, Mr. Speaker, and we are not going to try to. To keep the public better informed, we will be launching a new interactive web page, and a quarterly report to track progress and celebrate our successes. I will share these reporting tools with my colleagues and the public as they are released.  Mr. Speaker, the transformation to a polytechnic university is a critical step in the economic and social development of the territory. We are not just creating an institution; we are helping create the future of the Northwest Territories. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

This year’s theme was chosen in partnership with the NWT Literacy Council as a call to action that focuses on the importance of using Indigenous languages at home, at school, in the media, at work and in the community This year, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is also leading a campaign to recognize bilingual employees who are providing important government services to the public in Indigenous languages. The Bilingual Employees Recognition Initiative profiles some of our valuable public servants online and through the media as a way to celebrate the knowledge they hold and critical services they provide to northerners. Financial support has also been provided to each of the 7 regional Indigenous governments to host Indigenous Language Month events that help to raise the profile of the NWT’s Indigenous languages in communities. Information on Indigenous Languages Month activities in each region can be found by contacting regional Indigenous governments. Quote “Language and culture contribute to a strong sense of identity and pride for northerners. During Indigenous Languages Month, we celebrate the Elders, community leaders, teachers and public servants who are championing language revitalization efforts across the NWT. It’s through this dedication that we will realize our shared vision of a territory where all official languages are supported, respected and thriving.” - R.J.

401,2020-02-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-fostering-indigenous-languages,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Fostering Indigenous Languages,"Mr. Speaker, I stand in this House today to celebrate the nine official Indigenous languages of the Northwest Territories. How incredible that we have nine official Indigenous languages, unlike any other jurisdiction in Canada. Our languages are gifts to be protected, strengthened, valued and promoted.   Mr. Speaker, it is our responsibility to keep our languages alive, to ensure we are a Territory where Indigenous languages are supported, respected, and where they thrive. This is the vision that gives me hope, that gives us the energy and the drive to revitalize our languages, and that will help us ensure that our children and our youth retain a strong connection to their language and to who they are. Mr. Speaker, each of our Indigenous languages: Chipewyan, Tłı̨chǫ, South Slavey, North Slavey, Gwich’in, Cree, Inuvialuktun, Inuuinaqtun and Inuktitut, articulate the ways of knowing, doing, being and believing that are unique to their own communities and history. They define who we are as people of the Northwest Territories.    Indigenous languages are the essence of our identity, our people and our culture. Our Indigenous languages remind us of our relationships with each other, the land and the spiritual world. It is through the oral traditions, legends and stories of our ancestors, Elders, and knowledge keepers that we come to understand the history, geography and ecology of this land. These stories remind us to work together through consensus and collaboration, which is the basis of how we govern here in the Northwest Territories. Our languages benefit all of our residents. Mr. Speaker, I am one of the countless Indigenous people who never acquired the language that was spoken by my ancestors since time immemorial, so I understand the importance of fostering Indigenous languages, and commit this government to do so through the many revitalization initiatives currently in place, and those planned for the future.   Mr. Speaker, February is Indigenous Languages Month in the Northwest Territories, and       I am proud to be a part of a territory that acknowledges and celebrates the diversity of language, and the rich culture of its peoples. The theme of this year’s celebration is Say It With Me. This is a call to action that focuses on the importance of using Indigenous languages at home, at school, in the media, at work and in the community. These are the words of encouragement that the next generation of speakers needs to hear to increase the presence and value of Indigenous languages.  This month, we are supporting regional Indigenous governments to celebrate Indigenous Languages Month through community activities and events. As a government, we are also celebrating the bilingual Government of the Northwest Territories employees who provide important government services to the public in Indigenous languages. Next month, we will continue these celebrations by honouring 14 students graduating from Aurora College with the University of Victoria’s Certificate in Indigenous Language Revitalization.   Mr. Speaker, there are many exciting Indigenous language revitalization initiatives underway right now within the territory, we have: awarded 29 Indigenous Languages Revitalization Scholarships to postsecondary students in programs focused on Indigenous languages, piloted the Northwest Territories Indigenous Languages Mentor-Apprentice Program in partnership with three regional Indigenous governments which is helping 60 community participants build language fluency, delivered training for 20 Community Indigenous Language Instructors to support capacity building and give communities the tools they need to keep the languages vibrant and strong, provided training for over 100 Indigenous language teachers in instructional strategies and resources to use in school programs, and  we will be launching the new JK-12 Our Languages curriculum in our schools beginning in the 2020-2021 school year.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work that we have done to support Indigenous languages. Recently, on an education tour, I saw a wonderful example of this in action when I came across an Indigenous Language scramble game. This game started as a project created by students at Paul William Kaeser High School in Fort Smith who kick started the creation of a Chipewyan Scramble game. This ‘student created’ Indigenous language teaching tool became so popular that the South Slave Divisional Education Council invested in its commercial production, printing copies and distributing them to schools throughout the South Slave. It was not long before other school divisions began asking for copies in other Indigenous languages. In response, the game was redesigned to accommodate additional languages, and hundreds of copies have now been distributed to schools and libraries throughout the North with the hope that children, parents, and grandparents come together to explore their language through a fun and exciting family activity.    Mahsi cho to the Elders, community leaders, language advocates, and teachers who continue to promote Indigenous language revitalization efforts across the Northwest Territories. Mahsi cho to all the language learners who have the courage to Say It With Me in the Indigenous languages of the Northwest Territories. Most importantly, I want to encourage our young leaders and adult learners to take up the torch and become the new champions of Indigenous language revitalization across the Northwest Territories.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
402,2020-02-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-strongest-families-institute,Government Website,Diane Thom: Strongest Families Institute,"Mr. Speaker, every year, one in five Canadians experience a mental health challenge or illness. Young people aged 15 to 24 are more likely to experience a mental illness or substance use disorder than any other age group. Research also shows that 70 percent of mental health challenges begin during childhood or adolescence. These numbers are higher in the NWT with the impacts of intergenerational trauma and the legacies of colonization and residential schools. To help address these concerns, the Department of Health and Social Services released the Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Plan in June 2019 to guide changes to our mental wellness and addictions recovery system. A primary goal of the action plan is to ensure services are person and family-centered, recovery-oriented, trauma-informed, accessible, and culturally safe. We want people to experience positive and effective support at any point of entry into the system, and to remain engaged as partners in their care as they move toward healing and recovery in their lives.  As part of developing the action plan, the Department reached out to Northerners and key stakeholders. They made it clear that there was a need for more mental wellness and addictions recovery options and supports. One way to meet this need is to implement distance-based and eMental Health programs across the NWT. Launched in January 2020, Strongest Families Institute is the first of several mental health initiatives that are being implemented to complement in-person supports and options to residents. With our partners Bell Let’s Talk and Northwestel, we will invest $500,000 total over the next five years to have Strongest Families Institute provide telephone-based distance support for individuals and families experiencing mild to moderate anxiety, depression, and behavioural concerns.  Strongest Families Institute provides individuals and families with weekly access to trained coaches and skills-based programming to support their unique needs, experiences and goals. Because it is telephone-based, there are very few barriers. Once referred to the program, people can talk to their coach in the comfort and privacy of their own home at a time that works best for them, day or night.  Mr. Speaker, these award winning, evidence-based programs have been shown to help with child mental health issues, academic progress, bullying, family relationships, and parental stress. Strongest Families Institute has been providing these programs to all the Atlantic Provinces, Manitoba, and Finland for many years. An important focus of the Department of Health and Social Services is to work towards building and supporting a more culturally aware and informed health system. To ensure that the Strongest Families Institute’s programming is culturally respectful, it was co-designed with partners including Indigenous advisors. All of their coaches also receive ongoing diversity training to gain knowledge and support a variety of cultural traditions. Information specific to our Territory’s northern context has also been shared to help inform Strongest Families Institute coach and staff training. Mr. Speaker, Strongest Families Institute is one of many support options that residents can access in the NWT. We are committed to increasing the number and variety of culturally respectful and community-based mental wellness and addictions recovery options. Giving people more choices  in addition to things like the Community Counselling Program, the NWT Help Line, and on-the-land healing, is part of our commitment to building better mental wellness and addictions recovery success in the NWT.  There is no single approach that will work for everyone when it comes to addressing mental health and addictions. By providing a variety of options based on the needs of the person seeking support, we are more able to provide the right type of care, at the right time, by the right person. Going forward, we will continue to work with individuals and families who have first-hand experience with mental wellness and addictions recovery, as well as Indigenous governments, and other key stakeholders as we work to improve our system and better meet the needs of NWT residents. In closing, I want to thank Bell Let’s Talk and Northwestel for partnering with us in supporting mental wellness in our territory. I also want to encourage individuals and families seeking support to reach out to their local Community Counselling Program for more information on the Strongest Families Institute and its potential to provide some valuable support in their lives.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The Arctic Inspiration Prize recognizes and promotes the contribution made by teams who have dedicated their time to projects that serve the Canadian Arctic, the people and Canada as a whole.   Northern Compass, who has received a $1 million dollar prize, is made of a skilled team comprised of educators, students and community members from across North, including the Executive Director of Northern Youth Abroad – a program that has been jointly supported by the Departments of Education, Culture and Employment and Department of Municipal and Community Affairs over the years.  Northern Compass aims to enable Northern youth to successfully transition from high school to post-secondary education and on to fulfilling careers through pathways relevant to their cultural context. The program model will motivate and encourage youth to graduate high school, make informed decisions about their future, and then provide the support and access necessary to pursue and achieve their goals. The project proposes to serve youth between the ages of 15 and 25, living in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. This is the 2nd nomination for Northern Compass.     Quotes:  “I was happy to be able to present this award to Northern Compass last week in Ottawa. The project was started through Northern Youth Abroad’s network of passionate alumni and staff, with a mission that aligns well the goals of the GNWT. The Department of Municipal and Community Affairs has been a long-time supporter of the Northern Youth Abroad Program and as an extension, a supporter of the Northern Compass program, and I look forward to continuing to see the relationship continue over the years.”  -Paulie Chinna, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs    “One of our challenges in the NWT involves finding ways to support our students, particularly in our smaller communities, as they transition from high school to post-secondary. I am encouraged by the program model put forward by Northern Compass and am confident that they will support our goal of increasing student success across our territory.”  -R.J Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment    “Programs like Northern Compass are essential for the health of Northern youth. As a Northern Youth Abroad facilitator for the past 13 years, I have seen what can happen when our children are given opportunities to participate and learn. They emerge with a sense of pride in their culture and community, develop leadership skills, and are encouraged by the promotion of success in education.  I’d like to congratulate Northern Compass on this achievement and look forward to watching the program prosper.”  -Shane Thompson, Minister Responsible for Youth     Quick Facts: The Arctic Inspiration Prize may be distributed through as many as 10 prizes with a total value of $3 million dollars The Government of the Northwest Territories is a proud contributing partner to the Arctic Inspiration Prize.

405,2020-02-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-climate-change-progress-update,Government Website,Shane Thompson:  Climate Change Progress Update,"Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories knows that climate change is an important issue to Northwest Territories residents and all Canadians. That’s why strengthening the government’s leadership and authority on climate change and ensuring climate change impacts are considered when making government decisions are two of the 22 priorities identified by the 19th Legislative Assembly. Climate change affects our environment, our economy and the traditional way of life. Our communities continue to face impacts to their winter roads, shorelines and harvesting practices. A long-term and coordinated response in collaboration with all of our partners is needed to address climate change in the Northwest Territories. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources is proud to lead this work.   The 2030 NWT Climate Change Strategic Framework sets out our government’s long-term plan for addressing climate change. This includes actions in response to the 2017 report of the Auditor General of Canada. The Framework was developed with input from Indigenous governments and organizations, Northwest Territories residents and stakeholders and is a government-wide response to climate change.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report this work is well underway.  Last April, Environment and Natural Resources released the first five-year Climate Change Action Plan under the Framework. 95% of the actions led by the Government of the Northwest Territories are either on track or complete.  As well, in the last year, the Government of the Northwest Territories has: Released a Sustainable Livelihoods Action Plan to support access to country foods and being on the land; Funded a number of projects focused on climate change research, monitoring and adaptation; Worked with our Indigenous partners to establish two new Territorial Protected Areas; and Delivered a course to bring climate change into community decision-making. This is in addition to the Government of the Northwest Territories’ work to implement the NWT 2030 Energy Strategy.  Mr. Speaker, these are important accomplishments the Government of the Northwest Territories and our partners should be proud of.  Still, we know there is more to be done.  That’s why, over the next year, we will continue to work with our partners on the Climate Change Action Plan.  We look forward to releasing our first annual progress report, alongside annual reporting on the 2030 Energy Strategy.  Our government will continue to show leadership on climate change throughout the 19th Legislative Assembly, including the establishment of an NWT Climate Change Council with our Indigenous partners to help guide government actions. Mr. Speaker, relationships are key to advancing this agenda. This means honouring our partnerships with Indigenous governments and organizations and sharing what we know about climate change across Northern and Southern jurisdictions. It also means continuing to advocate for federal funding to address climate change and build strong, resilient communities.  Environment and Natural Resources remains committed to its leadership role on climate change. We will report on our progress and work together with Northerners to ensure our unique way of life can continue in a changing climate. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The 10-year ERI initiative was launched in 2013 to address identified gaps in student achievement and other challenges in the education system. ERI has introduced 45 initiatives focused on student-centered learning, student and educator health and wellness, quality education, the needs of small communities, flexibility in curriculum, assessment and accountability, and partnerships with Indigenous governments and organizations. This evaluation report reviewed 9 of 45 initiatives under the ERI Framework to see how these initiatives are working to improve outcomes for students across the NWT.  Evaluators found encouraging results and early successes in a number of areas. The report recommends continuing a number of promising programs, including Northern Distance Learning, to ensure equitable education in small communities, and Child and Youth Care Counsellors, to continue supporting students’ health and wellness.  The evaluation also identified where additional work is needed to address remaining gaps in student achievement and outcomes, especially for small communities. Key recommendations include prioritizing ERI commitments to focus on schools in small communities, including reviewing the current funding approach and working more closely with Indigenous governments, education leaders and families on present and future initiatives. A full list of recommendations can be found in the Executive Summary. Although distinct from the recent report on education tabled by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), the ERI evaluation report mirrors many of the findings of the audit, indicating that the GNWT has provided a fair analysis of its own systems. The ERI evaluation report has also given the department the opportunity to immediately responding to known challenges within the education system. The results of both the evaluation and audit will inform changes to education renewal and innovation over the next five years to ensure continued improvements to student outcomes in the NWT. Quote: “The first five years of Education Renewal and Innovation have shown promising results in the areas of student achievement and wellness, while providing important insights into remaining gaps and challenges in the NWT education system, especially for our smallest communities. The results of this evaluation will be essential in informing how we continue to work with our education partners, families, leaders and experts to improve experiences and outcomes for students in every community of the Northwest Territories. Education is a way to change the fortunes of the territory but only when we work together.”  - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment Quick Facts: The Education Renewal and Innovation Framework: Directions for Change was released in 2013 and serves as the roadmap for transforming the NWT education system to improve student experiences and outcomes. The end of the 2018-19 fiscal and school years marked the end of the first five years of the ERI Framework implementation. The ERI evaluation assessed the early implementation and results of the initiative to determine if the department is on track to achieve proposed changes, and to inform amendments moving forward.

Simpson: Office of the Auditor General Report on Education System,"Check Against Delivery   Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Report of the Office of the Auditor General of Canada was tabled on the audit of Early Childhood and the Kindergarten to Grade 12 education system in the Northwest Territories. The Report focused on five areas: Inclusive schooling; Indigenous language and culture-based education; equitable access to quality education; programming, staff qualifications, and training in licensed early childhood programs; and how these areas worked to support student outcomes.   The tabling of this report is timely, falling at the beginning of a new Legislative Assembly that has made it a priority to increase education outcomes to the same level as the rest of Canada. The recommendations from the Office of the Auditor General align with the areas where we have already begun to make changes, or are planning to invest more resources and improve programming and we have accepted their recommendations.   While we are making some headway and seeing promising results with programs like Northern Distance Learning, small communities remain in need of greater support. One of our highest priorities over the life of this government is to ensure equitable education delivery in all communities across the territory. We will be increasing our efforts to address the achievement gap among small communities and Yellowknife, and between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students to ensure that our education system is on par with the rest of Canada.  Mr. Speaker, later today the Department is holding a technical briefing on the five-year evaluation of the Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 Education Renewal and Innovation Framework.    As with the Auditor General’s report, this evaluation provides us important information on where select programs are working, where they need to improve, and whether they should be restructured to meet the needs of students.  We expect to table our management response in the coming weeks to incorporate the recommendations of the Auditor General and the findings of the Education Renewal and Innovation Evaluation. A renewed Education Renewal Innovation action plan will follow later this year. Mr. Speaker, we all know that education is a cornerstone for a healthy and successful life. However, we can only be successful through the work of many partners, and education is only one of the building blocks.  We will continue to work across departments and with Indigenous governments, parents, students, and with our education and community partners, to ensure we close the gaps to improve student outcomes, and provide youth with our best efforts for the future they deserve. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The Mandate will guide our actions as a government and serve to hold Cabinet accountable as we work to advance the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly. The Northwest Territories faces unprecedented challenges.  We have been elected in a time of global economic uncertainty, increasingly complex social issues, and multifaceted impacts of climate change. In the face of these challenges, I truly believe that the only way our Assembly can fulfill its promise to the residents of the Northwest Territories is to work together in the true spirit of consensus government. I speak on behalf of all Cabinet Members when I say we are committed to a government that is open, collaborative and cooperative.   The Mandate is built from the priorities we set together as newly elected Members of the 19th Legislative Assembly in October 2019.  It is strengthened by the input and advice we received from the Standing Committee on Accountability and Oversight.     I wish to thank Standing Committee for their willingness to work with us. Our shared commitment to cooperation and collaboration as Members of the 19th Legislative Assembly gives me confidence in what we can achieve over the next four years.       Mr. Speaker, I trust that all Members of this Assembly will see their insights, ideas and suggestions reflected in this Mandate.  I trust residents will see a set of clear and measureable actions needed to make progress within the life of this Assembly, and to hold this Cabinet to account as we work towards achieving our priorities.  I look forward to working together in advancing the Priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly through the implementation of the Mandate. Our Mandate provides a path forward, yet it is not written in stone.  We will encounter the unexpected, and must be able to adjust course as needed. Mr. Speaker, I spoke of challenging times, and the need to work together to actualize our priorities.  Working together cannot be done in the isolation of this house.   We need to make the time to listen to those impacted by our services and to people working on the frontlines of some of our most challenging issues. We all need to work together, Cabinet, Regular Members, Indigenous and community governments, and the federal government. We must remain mindful of each community’s unique challenges and opportunities. We are committed to meaningful, positive change in the way the government does business.  Very soon, this Assembly will debate the Budget and what that means to advancing our priorities. We must bear our overall fiscal situation in mind as we make decisions in the weeks ahead, and we must exercise caution to only commit to actions we have the means to achieve. Mr. Speaker, there will always be more we can do, but we know our needs outweigh our resources. This Cabinet welcomes the insight of Regular Members and looks forward to discussing how we can best apply our limited resources to achieve our priorities.  But now more than ever we need to be realistic in our expectations, creative in our approaches, and focus on making the most of what we have. The 19th Legislative Assembly brings together leadership from across the Northwest Territories, from backgrounds as diverse as our landscape and peoples. We have been called a historic government in terms of our gender balance. We have begun to foster effective dialogue between Cabinet and Regular Members in the spirit of consensus government. We have expressed our desire and willingness to make the changes our people want to see, especially in the area of Indigenous relations, social outcomes and economic outlook.  The 2019-2023 Mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories sets the direction for how we can seize opportunities to make this a pivotal term in the governance of the Northwest Territories.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
411,2020-02-06,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-bathurst-caribou-harvest-and-range-management,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Bathurst Caribou Harvest and Range Management,"Mr. Speaker, caribou are central to our communities, as a food source and as part of the local culture and way of life.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, our caribou herds are struggling. In particular, the Bathurst and Bluenose-East herds have suffered serious declines in recent years. The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to supporting our caribou through this period of decline. Today, I am here to highlight some of the actions the Department of Environment and Natural Resources is leading in our government’s efforts to manage human impacts on the Bathurst caribou herd. Mr. Speaker, five years ago, the Government of the Northwest Territories, together with Indigenous governments and organizations, and the Wek’èezhìi Renewable Resources Board, made the difficult decision to close the Bathurst caribou harvest. As a result of this decision, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources set up a no-harvest zone around the Bathurst caribou, known as the mobile zone. The boundaries of this zone change every week, based on the location of collared caribou. This is how we make sure the caribou are protected. It is illegal to hunt caribou in this zone, Mr. Speaker. Officers monitor the area by ground and by air throughout the winter. We have two check stations at Gordon and McKay Lake that are staffed 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. Local community members also assist Environment and Natural Resources with harvest monitoring. It is important that all hunters going out on the land know where this zone is. Maps with the current mobile zone are posted on Environment and Natural Resource’s website and Facebook page, on the winter roads and in our communities. Mr. Speaker, the people of the Northwest Territories take caribou conservation very seriously. We continue to work with our co-management partners to communicate the importance of this zone for protecting Bathurst caribou. It is up to each and every one of us to do our part to promote this herd’s recovery. Last August, the Government of the Northwest Territories released the Bathurst Caribou Range Plan.  This plan guides decision-makers, developers and communities, to help manage activities on the land in a way that supports the recovery of the Bathurst herd. Our Government is now working to set this plan into motion. This includes sitting down with our Indigenous partners to identify important habitat for Bathurst caribou, such as key land and water crossings and areas of unburned forest.  I am also pleased to report on our efforts to expand on-the-land programs to monitor Bathurst caribou. Last month a workshop with Indigenous groups from across the range of the Bathurst herd was held to further develop a Bathurst Caribou Guardianship Initiative, which included representatives from Nunavut. The workshop brought in members of the Hamayas (ha-MY-us) Stewardship Network from the Queen Charlotte Islands to share their knowledge and experiences as Guardians on their traditional lands. Mr. Speaker, traditional knowledge tells us caribou have always experienced periods of highs and lows. The current population estimate for the Bathurst herd is the lowest it has ever been, that we know of.  It is up to all of us to support our caribou herds through this current low, towards recovery. ENR has heard from communities and wildlife co-management partners that all management actions need to be considered including wolf management.  Environment and Natural Resources and the Tłı̨chǫ Government developed a Wolf Management Proposal based on the best available traditional, local and scientific knowledge.  It includes management actions for wolves on the winter range of the Bathurst and Bluenose-East herds as a way to promote the recovery of these barren-ground caribou herds and support the traditional economy. The next population survey for Bathurst caribou is just a few months away, in June, and results will be available in the late fall. Together with local and traditional knowledge, these survey results will inform our actions going forward, to manage and protect barren-ground caribou.  By applying the best available knowledge together with our co-management partners, we can help support healthy caribou populations for future generations of Northerners. Thank you, Mr. Speaker"

Thom: Opening Address - 2nd Session of the 19th Legislative Assembly,"Check Against Delivery.  Please be seated.      Happy New Year everyone!  I am once again honoured to welcome you all back.  I trust you all had a wonderful festive season with your loved ones.   As we enter a new decade, we begin our work for the people of the Northwest Territories.  Your work can be challenging, but working together as a team will ensure you make the best decisions.  I wish you a productive session with good outcomes and personal balance with life and work for each of you. I am very pleased to be opening this Session of Canada’s first and only gender-balanced Legislative Assembly, led by Canada’s only sitting female Premier.  This may also be one of the youngest Legislative Assemblies to have been elected in the Northwest Territories in recent memory. And it is the second Assembly in a row to have more first-time Members than returning Members.  It is clear in looking around this room that the people of the Northwest Territories voted for change during the last election.    The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to delivering the change that our people have called for, as well as ensuring their voices are heard throughout the life of this government.  During this Session, the Government will be tabling its 2019-2023 mandate. This document will present the Government’s plan for advancing the priorities agreed to by all Members of the Legislative Assembly.  Our plan puts people first and recognizes that government succeeds when we support the success of every person in the territory. It is a holistic plan that takes into account the physical, social, wellness, and employment needs of residents.  We know that people need a strong and secure foundation on which to grow, beginning with the basics of food, shelter and health.  To address the need for shelter, we will work with stakeholders to increase the number of quality, energy-efficient and affordable housing units and put a stronger focus on community home ownership opportunities. We will support seniors to stay in their homes and communities, by providing increased access to housing programs, increasing the Home Heating Subsidy, and establishing a Community Grant Program for senior supports.  We will also take action to protect seniors from abuse or neglect, and create a separate income assistance program tailored to seniors and persons with disabilities.  We will increase food security by implementing regulatory and program changes to support locally produced and marketed foods. We will work with indigenous and community governments to support community greenhouses, gardens and country food harvesting.  As well, we will work with applicable governments to define community solutions to the Nutrition North Program. To improve the health of NWT residents, we will work with our employees and partners to strengthen our health care recruitment strategy and implement comprehensive labour force planning.  We will also work with communities to increase the availability of e-health, traditional, on-the-land, and other proven approaches to mental wellness and addictions recovery.  We will improve wellness supports including increasing peer support programming, providing transitional housing for those returning from addiction treatment, and establishing medical detox and managed alcohol programming.  We will also strengthen community counselling services by providing standardized screening and assessment tools, improving employee training opportunities, and reducing wait times for accessing counselling.  As well as taking care of basic needs we need to support residents, businesses, Indigenous and community governments so they have the tools to succeed.  To increase early childhood development, we will ensure better coordination of services, and streamline funding to support community-based parenting and early childhood development programming.  We will develop a 10-year Universal Childcare Strategy, and increase child care spaces by providing non-government organizations with retrofit funding, amend policies to allow licensed childcare in public housing, and better utilize our own government infrastructure for early childhood program space.  An increase in childcare space will require more workers, so we will increase support for NWT students who wish to pursue qualified childcare programming. We will support educational success by modernizing the Education Act and education funding framework.  We will ensure distance learning is available in all small communities and pilot a Classroom Assistant training program. We will implement programming to assist schools and parents make decisions together about student placements and social passing, and we will continue to transform Aurora College into an accredited and independent polytechnic university. Our government also recognizes that people want and deserve to have employment opportunities. Good jobs and meaningful work provides people with both the means to support themselves and their families, as well as a sense of accomplishment and pride.  We will increase economic diversification and employment in small communities by developing regional economic development plans, increasing the number of journeypersons and apprentices in small communities, advancing the knowledge economy, and expanding tourism throughout the NWT. As well, we will change policies to allow licenced home businesses in public housing units, mentor entrepreneurs and support community-led maker-spaces.  This government will support local businesses and encourage entrepreneurship by reducing red tape and regulatory burdens. We will also ensure that more benefits from government spending stay in the north by strengthening our procurement policies like the Business Incentive Policy, Northern Manufactured Products Policy, and our approach to Public-Private Partnerships.  We will promote local competition by increasing awareness of GNWT contracting opportunities, actively encouraging NWT businesses to apply for BIP status, and developing a one-stop shop for vendors online.  As well, we will take action to improve the environment for resource development – which is still the biggest sector of the NWT economy – and make sure NWT residents are benefiting from it as much as they can.  We will do this by collaborating with Indigenous governments to develop and implement regional mineral strategies, increase resource exploration and development, increase funding for mining incentive programs and look for new ways to support advanced projects.   As well, we will assess the feasibility of local gas supply projects and the export of liquefied natural gas. To ensure NWT residents enjoy a fair share of the benefits of development, we will a conduct an independent comparison review of our royalty and taxation regimes and socio-economic agreements.  We will meet annually with senior officials of NWT mines to review the results and utilize the recommendations in future agreements.  We also understand people need a sense of belonging and the stability of strong, affordable communities and a clean environment to thrive.  That is why our government will respect and strengthen the ability of communities and regions to make their own decisions, based on their own needs and priorities, including empowering our own regional staff.  We will settle treaty, land, resources and self-government agreements by working with facilitators and engaging directly on a leader-to-leader basis.  We will establish a Special Joint Committee on Indigenous Reconciliation between Cabinet and Regular Members of the Legislative Assembly and review the principles and interests that inform our negotiating mandates. With Indigenous governments, we will also create an action plan that identifies changes required in GNWT legislation and policies to best reflect the principles set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.  This Government will also take steps to increase the resiliency of communities, support their capacity, and help make them affordable places to live.  We will do this by reducing the municipal funding gap, refining our funding models, exploring opportunities for community governments to raise additional revenue, and reducing or stabilizing the cost of delivering core programs and services.  Reducing the cost of power remains a priority, as does reducing our reliance on diesel for generating community power. We know that in many cases moving to greener energy costs the system more money, not less when we have to keep diesel as a backup. We will look to long term solutions including connecting more communities to existing hydro systems.  We will also work with partners and stakeholders to target energy conservation and efficiency programs for small and remote communities where the costs of energy are highest and the need is greatest.  As well, we will create a stronger and more affordable territory through strategic infrastructure investments that connect communities, expand the economy and reduce the cost of living. This will include advancing projects like the Mackenzie Valley Highway, the Slave Geological Province Corridor and Taltson Hydro Expansion. We will also invest in fast and reliable broadband Internet services for communities and modernize our airport infrastructure.  Finally, because the land is the life and the source of wellbeing and security for NWT residents, our government will do more to ensure that our environment is conserved and protected and we will ensure climate change impacts are considered when making government decisions.  We will also establish a Northwest Territories Climate Change Council, bringing together our government with Indigenous and community governments, MLAs and other partners to strengthen our leadership and authority on climate change. This is an ambitious agenda aimed at responding to the needs of people and making sure all residents are able to succeed and thrive. We know it will take more than four years to reach some of our goals, but we are committed to beginning the work now and encouraging future governments to continue it.  During this session, the Government of the Northwest Territories will also be introducing the following bills for consideration by the House: Appropriation Act (Operations Expenditures), 2020-2021; Supplementary Appropriation Act (Infrastructure Expenditures), No. 3, 2019-2020;  Supplementary Appropriation Act (Operations Expenditures), No. 4, 2019-2020; and Supplementary Appropriation Act (Infrastructure Expenditures), No. 1, 2020-2021. The government considers these bills essential to the good conduct of government business and as such, I recommend their passage. As your Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, I now declare open the Second Session of the 19th Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories.   Thank you, Merci Beaucoup, Mahsi Cho, Quanani, Koana.  "
413,2020-02-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-2019-novel-coronavirus-update,Government Website,Diane Thom: 2019 Novel Coronavirus Update,"Check against delivery  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to provide an update to Northerners on the 2019 novel coronavirus. I would like to assure residents that at this time the risk of contracting this virus is low in the NWT.  Since the coronavirus was first reported in the Hubei Province of China, our Government and the Federal Government have moved quickly to ensure we are prepared. Our public health and emergency preparations are well underway and we will continue to monitor the situation as it develops. I would like to fill Members in on the preparations that we’ve undertaken as I know that the anxiety level about this outbreak has increased in our communities. Our Chief Public Health Officer is providing leadership to health emergency planners and senior management within the Health and Social Services system to ensure our communities and frontline staff are ready should the coronavirus be suspected or confirmed in the NWT. The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer and health emergency officials are constantly in touch with their Federal, Provincial and Territorial counterparts to ensure the sharing of timely and accurate information. I am sure Members and residents are curious as to what specific preparations we have completed to date, and if we are prepared to handle possible cases in the NWT. It is important to remind everyone that we’ve been here before. We have learned a great deal from the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, known as SARS, and the ongoing surveillance of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, known as MERS. Similar to the current outbreak, these events required international coordination and response as well as preparations here within the NWT. As with these other events, there is no vaccine; instead, the approach is to prevent the spread of the coronavirus using best practices in public health.     This is vital in order to rapidly identify people who might be sick and apply appropriate precautions in health care settings and communities. Our Chief Public Health Officer and her office is participating in daily briefings with her Federal, Provincial and Territorial counterparts to get the latest information to inform clinical information for frontline staff.  Internal alerts are sent to frontline staff to ensure their personal protective equipment is ready, testing protocols are defined, necessary infection control measures are being practiced, and health facilities are ready to respond in the event that a person in NWT develops symptoms concerning for novel coronavirus infection. We also have a responsibility to communicate to our residents, Indigenous and community governments, schools, tourist operators, day cares and businesses. Mr. Speaker, these stakeholders were provided the most current information on hand along with public education materials for them to share with their stakeholders. As this situation is rapidly evolving, we are committed to providing the most current information through the Department of Health and Social Services website.  We have also started a general communication campaign through social media and traditional media including newspapers and radio ads to raise awareness about the virus. This includes preventive steps residents can take to protect themselves and their loved ones. The advice will sound very familiar as it is similar to what we recommend for the flu, such as staying home if sick and contacting your local public health unit or health centre if you have symptoms of concern. Also, the importance of regular hand-washing, the use of hand sanitizers and healthy respiratory practices can not be emphasized enough, especially since we have other infectious diseases circulating in our communities including the flu and whooping cough or pertussis.  These practices will help reduce the spread of all these illnesses.  Travellers from places of known activity of this coronavirus – particularly the Hubai Province of China – are being provided information at their international points of entry into Canada to self-monitor. We also know that NWT residents travel internationally for both business and pleasure. It is important that residents pay special attention to travel advisories issued by the Federal Government. This information is routinely updated on the Government of Canada’s website under Travel Advice and Advisories. This link is found on our Department’s website including direct reference on our coronavirus section. Mr. Speaker, as this situation evolves our thoughts are with China as they continue to take extraordinary efforts to contain this epidemic. Our thoughts are also with Canadian individuals and families who have been impacted by these events directly or indirectly. The NWT will continue to monitor and assess this dynamic situation, and be a part of national actions to ensure we are prepared as a healthcare system and as a government.   Thank You, Mr. Speaker."

I would also like to take a moment and extend regrets from the Premier of the Northwest Territories, Caroline Cochrane for not being able to join us this evening.  She had planned to welcome everyone this evening and I know she was looking forward to speaking with many of you – but was unfortunately called back unexpectedly and had to return home this evening.  It has been a busy few days here in Vancouver, and though the Premier was called away, she was able to lead some important conversations this week in meetings that Minister Thompson and myself have joined her in, as well as participated in some important announcements that I will touch on shortly – and for that I know she is grateful.  As many of you know, coming to Roundup is important for our government and as the new Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment and Minister of Infrastructure – it was especially important for me. Coming this year as the Minister responsible for this important sector – it was essential for me that as many opportunities as possible were seized to formally introduce myself to the members of the industry, meet with some of our partners, and most importantly, hear directly from exploration companies who are already doing business in the North to find out how we, as a government, can better support them.  I think I bring a unique perspective to the table and one that I am hoping can be leveraged as our government works to increase the resource development sector in the North. I am, as I like to call it, a boots-on-the-ground Engineer by trade and have first-hand experience about what it’s like to do business in the North. I have been on the other side of the table - working with partners and the government, applying for permits, trying to navigate the procurement process and much more. I also understanding firsthand the importance of making sure mining in the North is done safely, having worked on the Giant Mine project for a number of years. I understand that the NWT has some challenges, but because of my experiences, I have some ideas about ways they can be improved – starting first with strengthening our partnerships and continuing to facilitate the relationships between Indigenous and public governments and industry.  This will be key in progressing this sector in a safe and sustainable way. Our partners are one of our greatest assets in the North and I want to take a moment to highlight and celebrate some of the partnerships that, I believe, are leading to new opportunities in our mining industry. First, I’d like to recognize the leadership of Cheetah Resources, Det’on Cho Corporation, and the Yellowknives Dene. Their contract, to begin Canada’s first rare earth project, with the first Indigenous-led mine site, could be a game changer - not just for our territory, but our country. I also want to congratulate the Gwich’in Tribal Council and Inuvialuit Regional Corporation for the release of their regional mining strategies earlier today.   These strategies will serve as roadmaps for industry looking to explore, and action plans for Indigenous governments as they seek to attract investment on their terms. And finally I’d like to highlight the partnerships we have our neighbouring territories and Canada.  On Sunday, the Premier participated in an announcement for the Invest Canada North Initiative.  A brand new partnership - backed by the Government Canada and supported by Canada’s three territorial governments and the industry representatives that make up the North’s mining and exploration sector.  These kinds of partnerships are leading the way back to prosperity in our territory.  That’s really the purpose of coming out in force to events like these: to build relationships and seek out new partnerships which will benefit our territory. Collaboration will improve our collective fortunes.  I want to close my remarks tonight by reiterating what many of you already know – that this is an exciting time for the North.  For the first time ever, we have a gender-balanced Assembly governing our work, and the only female Premier in Canada. Other female leaders such as the City of Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty and Grand Chief Bobbi-Jo Greenland who I believe are both here tonight, are also contributing to the excitement of the North and the batch of strong females we have leading the way for the next generation. We’re also going to start to see some of our transformative projects take shape – which is something to look forward to. The Slave Geological Province, Mackenzie Valley Highway and Taltson Hydro Expansion are projects that will connect our communities, green our economy and support exploration companies as they look to the North to do business and access our rich mineral deposits in a way that is environmentally sustainable.  I am excited for the future of the NWT and proud to be standing here today in this role as Minister of ITI and Infrastructure, but also as part of a government that is committed to working together, hearing concerns and then trying to solve the problems based on all the information collected.  I hope many of you will be part of our future and I’d like to you for being here this evening. I look forward to meeting and speaking with as many of you as possible tonight, and in the future. "

The release of the strategies was welcomed this morning at the AME Roundup – an event at which Northwest Territories Indigenous governments and organizations have been playing a growing and significant role.  The regional strategies, developed with funding from the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment under the Mineral Development Strategy, were formally unveiled by GTC Grand Chief/President Bobbie Jo Greenland-Morgan and IRC Chair and CEO Duane Ningaqsiq Smith. Each strategy outlines existing geological data, maps and information, a comprehensive history of the areas and an outline of local organizations, groups and authorities. A goal of regional mineral development strategies is to provide a clear vision and direction for mineral explorers, investors and others in the industry to guide comprehensive, respectful and sustainable mining practices.   Quote: “These strategies are integral to our work to attract investment in the Northwest Territories mineral industry. Our partnership with Indigenous Governments continues to grow through our joint presence at events such as AME Roundup and the release of regional mineral development strategies. We are at the table together, and investors have a clear picture of that.”   Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment “The Gwich’in must control what happens on our lands – we want to be true partners in any projects undertaken, from concept to close out. The strategy was developed with the input of leadership and people in the Gwich’in communities. We hope this will lead to strong partnerships and economic opportunities that can benefit both the Gwich’in and the Northwest Territories.” Bobbie Jo Greenland-Morgan, Grand Chief/President, Gwich’in Tribal Council “With the production of the draft Roadmap to Mineral Exploration and Development in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC) outlines its priorities to support responsible mineral development in the Region. IRC continues to work in partnership with the Government of the Northwest Territories and Government of Canada to promote potential opportunities in mineral exploration in the North. "" IRC Chair and CEO Duane Smith   Quick Facts: Mining and exploration regularly directly contributes more than 20% of total economic activity annually in the Northwest Territories.

Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge that we are on the traditional territory of the Musqueam, Squamish, and  Tsleil-Waututht First Nations. It’s a pleasure to be here today among partners from the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation and Gwich’in Tribal Council to celebrate a milestone for our local minerals industry.  The launch of regional mineral strategies is a vision the Government of the Northwest Territories had in Mineral Development Strategies. It identified the need to build capacity in our territory’s Indigenous communities – not just in the Beaufort Delta, but right across the NWT. Together, our government worked with the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation and the Gwich’in Tribal Council to develop regional strategies that will encourage, guide, and support mineral exploration and development specific to their regions.   Today, with the release of these documents, we are formally recognizing the completion of our planning – and looking forward to the next step – investment and exploration.    The strategies offer roadmaps for companies looking to do business in the traditional territories of the Inuvialuit and Gwich’in and outline what the leadership in these regions will do to make their traditional territories attractive to responsible developers.  It is appropriate that we highlight these documents here at Roundup because this annual event has been significant in building the capacity that will allow indigenous governments and organizations to participate at the next level - as leaders, funders and even owners of mining projects.  We are at the table together, and investors have a clear picture of that.   I would like to recognize each of you here today as representatives of Indigenous governments and organizations - and to thank you for your participation and support. Collectively – we’re getting the job done and turning our mineral potential into local benefits.  Awareness and recognition for the NWT’s resource potential is growing – as is the respect for our Indigenous governments and the role that they play.   The underlying message that unites these two documents is this:  Indigenous governments and organizations of the Northwest Territories want to see a balanced and responsible approach to the management of our economy and our environment – and they want to be meaningful and equal partners and participants in the development of our North.   By working through Indigenous government development corporations — and with NWT mines — the NWT has developed successful business models and a foundation from which we are ready to take the next step.The Northwest Territories is a region rich in resources and people. We have the tools needed for success and social buy-in. If you’re looking to invest, this is where you should be looking. Thank you again for being here and congratulations to the IRC and GTC and everyone else who made this happen.    "

It’s our future and today, we celebrate an exciting new chapter.  The signing of this agreement today is a demonstration that NWT resources, outside of our diamonds, are getting international attention — an indicator that we’re rounding the corner and on the road to progress in our mining industry once again.

With the move towards lower-carbon, tech-intensive economies, Canada – thanks to the Northwest Territories and the partners here today - is in a position to build the domestic supply-chain which has– to date - eluded our country and our allies.    Today’s announcement is notable for another reason.  This contract marks a step forward in our territory’s push for Indigenous resource leadership. I want to congratulate the Yellowknives’ Det’on Cho Corporation for characteristically taking the lead on a big idea.  And I would like to commend Cheetah Resources for their commitment to placing Indigenous peoples at this project’s core.   It is a tangible example of the sustainable development and social responsibility that we talk about so often in the Northwest Territories in-line with our territory’s priorities and values. I don’t want to take up much more time as today is about our partners, but I did want to share a thought.  It has always struck me that the Northwest Territories is a land of many “firsts” and “onlys.”  We’re home to the first Canadian diamonds; the only gender-balanced Assembly ever elected and currently the only female Premier. So it is fitting that this chapter in our mining future begins with this story of firsts: Canada’s first rare earths mine and the first Indigenous government poised to lead a mine site in our country.  Our government looks forward to seeing this partnership unfold and the benefits that will follow.  Congratulations for this milestone and thank you to everyone for being here. "

426,2020-01-19,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-invest-canada-north-launch,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Invest Canada North Launch ,"Check against delivery  Good Morning and thank you for being here.  I’d like to recognize Premier Sandy Silver, Parliamentary Secretary Larry Bagnell and of course our partners with the Yukon, NWT and Nunavut Chamber of Mines – Anne Turner and Tom Hoefer.  I am happy to be here with each of you for this announcement, and thank you for your efforts to put together this event this morning.  You’ve already heard people talk about the details of this announcement so I won’t get in to that, but what I will say is that progress on projects in the North – that will benefit all Canadians – would not be possible without partnerships and funding commitments like this. The North is rich in resource potential – including minerals that will fuel the global green economy and support climate change efforts. Mining and exploration is also the biggest source of private sector jobs and income for our residents and we are committed to doing our part to support the health of the sector.  Invest Canada North will help us build a strong case in the global marketplace and set the stage for responsible investments in our future. The North has all the ingredients for investor success, but we need to ensure that message is being heard.  It is fitting that this announcement is being made as we get ready for a few days of busy meetings during Roundup. As with my Northern colleagues, attendance at Roundup is important for our government.  The 19th Legislative Assembly has identified increasing resource exploration and development in the NWT as a priority for our government. Being in Vancouver this week will no doubt lead to some beneficial discussions with industry, provide opportunities to highlight the important role partnerships with Indigenous governments and communities are and of course, is a chance to reaffirm awareness across industry of our governments political support for and commitment to this sector. I look forward to seeing how this initiative progresses over the next few years and the role that the Government of the Northwest Territories will play to support its successes.  Thank you. "
427,2020-01-17,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/geological-map-updated-mineral-rich-slave-geological-province,Government Website,Geological Map Updated for the Mineral-Rich Slave Geological Province,"An updated bedrock geology map and database will aid explorers and academic researchers investigating the mineral-rich Slave Geological Province.   The updated map, resulting from several years of data collection and analysis, has been published by the Northwest Territories Geological Survey (NTGS) in partnership with the Canada-Nunavut Geoscience Office. Dr. Mike Stubley, a former Government of Northwest Territories employee and highly-experienced geologist, led the work.  The updated map is based on Dr. Stubley’s original map published by the NTGS in 2005. Underlying eastern Northwest Territories and western Nunavut, the Slave Geological Province is well known for its excellent mineral potential and long and prosperous history of mining. Among other geological elements, the updated map contains improved information on rock types favorable for mineral exploration and the location of known kimberlite bodies. Kimberlite is a rare and unique rock type, and some kimberlite bodies contain diamonds. The significance of the project extends beyond mineral exploration and academic research. The updated map has already been used in assessing potential routes for the proposed Slave Geological Province all-season road.  The NTGS is a science-mandated division of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment. The research conducted by the division enables government, residents and investors to make informed decisions and advance the knowledge economy.   Quote: “The Slave Geological Province is an economic breadbasket for the Northwest Territories. Mining and exploration regularly contribute more than 20% of total economic activity in the territory, and the vast majority of that takes place in the mineral-rich Slave Province. With renewed data, industry and academics alike can work to better understand the geology and mineral potential of this region and advance the territory’s economy.”   Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment Quick Facts: The NWT’s three active diamond mines (Ekati, Diavik and Gahcho Kue) are all located within the Slave Geological Province.  Data for the updated map was contributed by a number of companies including Diamondex Resources Ltd., Strongbow Exploration Inc., GGL Diamond Corp., Kennady Diamonds, Aurora Geosciences, TMAC Resources, MMG Resources, BNT Gold Resources, North Arrow Minerals, and Miramar Mining Corp.
