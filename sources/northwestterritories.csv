3,2021-06-14,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/premier-cochrane-re-appointment-commissioner-margaret-thom,Government Website,Premier Cochrane on the re-appointment of Commissioner Margaret Thom,"Premier Cochrane issued the following statement on the re-appointment of Northwest Territories Commissioner Margaret Thom: “I want to congratulate Commissioner Margaret Thom on her re-appointment as Commissioner of the Northwest Territories by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week. “In the last 116 years, Commissioner Thom is only the third woman in the history of the Northwest Territories to hold the position. As a strong Dene woman from the Deh Cho region, Commissioner Thom has impacted the lives of many Northerners, especially in her home region. As an educator, counselor, facilitator, and volunteer, Commissioner Thom has dedicated her life to preserving Dene Zhatie and the Dene culture. A residential school survivor, Commissioner Thom has contributed to the health and wellness of Northerners in a variety of areas, including post-secondary education, community health, and mental health and addictions treatment, to name a few. She has supported her community and youth through her work as a school community counselor in Fort Providence, and as a program officer with the Deh Gah Got’ine First Nation.  “As our government has evolved over time, so has the role of the Commissioner. It was just over 30 years ago that the Commissioner would have been directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Government of the Northwest Territories, holding many of the same responsibilities that I hold today. “In her role, Commissioner Thom represents the interests of the North, and the powerful symbol of her role that unites us as Northerners. The demands of being Commissioner require a person with unique characteristics. To represent and reflect their interests, the Commissioner needs to know and be in touch with people all across the Northwest Territories. “Commissioner Thom is just this person – she carries herself with dignity and dedication, and cares deeply about the institutions of government and her role. She rises above personal interest with such selflessness: a true representative of all residents of the Northwest Territories. “It has been an honour and privilege to work with Commissioner Thom, and I look forward to working with her over the next year.”"

5,2021-06-09,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/government-northwest-territories-introduces-new-step-step-approach-ending-pandemic,Government Website,Government of the Northwest Territories introduces new step-by-step approach to ending pandemic restrictions,"Today, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) released Emerging Wisely 2021: Step by Step Together, its plan for easing and ending pandemic restrictions. The plan outlines the public health restrictions that will be eased starting today. This plan sets specific targets based on vaccination levels in the NWT and across Canada as well as COVID-19 case counts. As these targets are reached, restrictions will be eased or discontinued until eventually no public health restrictions remain. Specific targets have been established based on an informed risk analysis and are outlined in the plan. The Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) has determined, based on vaccination levels in the NWT, that it is now safe to ease restrictions on outdoor gatherings in the NWT.  Indoor gathering restrictions will be eased next. The CPHO is targeting the end of the current school year for this change to take effect. Waiting until the school year has finished will help to ensure that a level of safety remains in place for the most vulnerable population; children under 12-years-old.  Emerging Wisely 2021 – Step by Step Together also outlines changes to self-isolation requirements and travel restrictions in the NWT for both residents and out-of-territory leisure travellers. It is anticipated that the self-isolation period for fully vaccinated travellers may be eliminated by early summer. By fall, leisure travel is expected to resume and be open to all visitors without the need for an exemption. Quotes “Emerging Wisely 2021 – Step by Step Together is a plan tailored to the Northwest Territories and will provide a path forward so we can emerge from the pandemic, safely. This is an evidence-based plan built on data, rather than firm dates, and supports our efforts to ensure we make the best decisions for our residents. With this new plan, we are positioned to respond to the pandemic’s evolving nature and ease restrictions as conditions and information allow, enhance restrictions as required, and target restrictions as necessary.  - Caroline Cochrane, Premier “Our healthcare system is critical to the health and safety of NWT residents and it can’t be taken for granted. Whether you are healthy, or you are recovering from a COVID-19 infection, or you have been diagnosed with another illness, this plan protects all of us while allowing each of us to determine our own risk tolerance. We all need to continue to do our very best to understand the risk associated with the choices that we make, and how to stay safe while managing that risk.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services “In the world of public health no one is safe until everyone is safe. While I understand that individual choice about these restrictions is valuable to residents, we will continue to work toward the common health of the entire NWT population. I am pleased to see vaccination levels rising and COVID-19 cases decreasing in other jurisdictions. You have done your part well, and we need to take cautious steps toward easing restrictions so that we can continue to keep our communities and residents safe.” - Dr. Kami Kandola, Chief Medial Health Officer Quick Facts The GNWT will now include community-level vaccination data on the GNWT dashboard each week along with regional and territorial coverage updates. It can be filtered by eligible population aged 18+, eligible population aged 12+, or overall population of the NWT, like in other jurisdictions. Beginning today, public health restrictions on outdoor gatherings will be relaxed for events up to 200 people if physical distancing is possible. By early summer, it is anticipated that self-isolation and testing requirements for domestic travellers will be eased. This will allow fully vaccinated travellers to travel without being required to self-isolate upon their return and will allow shortened self-isolation periods for partially vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers. By the fall of 2021, it is anticipated that all public health restrictions in the NWT will be lifted.

Overall, participants expressed an interest in seeing new land administration regulations that provide greater public clarity, transparency, and consistency for dispositions of public land. The results of the round 1 engagement, along with cross-jurisdictional reviews and additional policy research will be used to help inform the development of the regulations to bring the new Public Land Act into force. Engagement with Intergovernmental Council Secretariat members, Indigenous and community governments, and stakeholders will be ongoing throughout the regulations development. The Department will be releasing the report on its website and sending a link of the report to the organizations that engaged with the Department between December 2020 and March 2021.

No matter who you choose to love, or what identity defines you, no one should have to face persecution or discrimination. “Residents should be able to celebrate their own identity free of judgement. For decades, the LGBTQ+ community has fought hard for the same basic human rights that we all expect to have – many of which are taken for granted. 2SLGBTQIA+ people continue to face discrimination every day because of who they are and who they love. As a society, we cannot tolerate this, and must continue to ensure 2SLGBTQIA+ people are treated equally and fairly. We are your allies and stand with you. “June is not only a month to celebrate the 2SLGBTQIA+ community; it is also a time to celebrate the acceptance of a community, and the progress that has been made on a very simple statement: love is love. “People have spent decades fighting for the right to marriage, to adopt and build a family, and to express their gender and identity. It’s important we continue to have an open dialogue about how our society has treated 2SLGBTQIA+ people in the past, and how we can move forward, together. “I want to thank all those who have taken up this fight – you have sacrificed so much to help build a more inclusive and tolerant society. Your courage has helped change the lives of many just like you. “There is still a lot of work to do to ensure the rights of 2SLGBTQIA+ people are respected, and the Government of the Northwest Territories remains committed to defending the rights of 2SLGBTQIA+ residents and continuing to support all efforts to rid our society of intolerance, and promote equality for all.”"

The two programs, the Pandemic Relief Extension Program (PREP) for tourism operators, and the Supplement for Tourism Accommodation Relief (STAR) Program for accommodation providers who meet the criteria, were developed to support two of the hardest hit sectors impacted by the pandemic. PREP will assist licensed tourism operators with eligible fixed costs within the NWT at a minimum of $2,500 (to a maximum of $100,000). Home-based tourism businesses will be also able to access this relief funding. With licensed accommodation providers reporting significant drops in occupancy levels, the STAR program will provide financial assistance for eligible expenses in facilities with three or more rooms.  Building on the support and critical partnership of the federal government last year, the two programs are available for application now, and will provide support to these two sectors as they continue to look forward to travel restrictions easing.  Quote “While we are all looking forward to travel restrictions easing, until that happens industries that rely more heavily on out-of-territory investment will continue to need support to be ready for recovery. The tourism and accommodation sectors are an important part of our diversified economy, and two significantly impacted industries that require targeted assistance. I believe these new programs will help these sectors maintain their footing to be able to welcome visitors back to our territory.” - Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment Quick facts In the fall of 2020, 75% of tourism businesses reported a decline in revenues of at least 50%. Average occupancy levels for hotels reporting dropped from 65% in 2019 to 39% in 2020. Accommodation providers’ costs have increased due to now mandatory standards of sanitization and personal protective equipment. These programs build on previous supports from the GNWT, delivered in partnership with the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor).

The provision of this housing supports the Government of the Northwest Territories’ mandate to ensure the availability of affordable housing as well as to consider climate change impacts when making government decisions. Yellowknife will benefit with these replacement units, as they will keep residents in homes that are safe and healthy. These units will form part of the NWTHC’s Public Housing portfolio. Across the NWT, the 2400 Public Housing units are delivered to residents by NWTHC’s community partners, Local Housing Organizations (LHOs), in Yellowknife this is the Yellowknife Housing Authority. The Public Housing program is critical to ensuring that many NWT residents have a safe and affordable place to call home. This 8-Plex will do just that, providing new homes for eight Public Housing clients in Yellowknife. Moving forward, these units will no longer rely on oil. They will be using a biomass heating system that is better for the environment. This way northerners and our environment benefit from the change in heating system. A sustainable future is what the NWTHC is moving towards. Quote “These new units are about reducing the need for housing in our communities. The NWTHC aims to keep all residents housed in healthy homes. We will always do what we can for the environment, which is why the eventual switch to a biomass district heating system for these units is so exciting.” - Paulie Chinna, Minister Responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation Quick facts These eight units have been replaced to keep northern residents housed in healthy and safe conditions.

Quotes “We recognize the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have on people and the economy and that certain sectors, such as the air transportation industry, have suffered tremendously. The plunge in air travel demand because of the coronavirus and travel restrictions aimed to stop its spread have put a harsh financial burden on an industry so critical in the north. We want to provide relief for this important industry as it struggles to remain in operation and as the NWT continues to depend on them for commerce and connectivity. -  Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance   “The Northwest Territories’ aviation industry plays a critical role in the economic and social well-being of our residents. In addition to keeping our people and communities connected, the aviation industry provides essential services, including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, forest fire response, and much more. Continuing to find ways to support this industry, especially during this difficult time, remains a priority for our government and I am pleased that we are able to make this announcement today.” -Diane Archie, Minister of Infrastructure Quick Facts Today’s funding announcement covers the period of January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021. Previously announced supports for the NWT aviation industry include the waiving of all landing fees at NWT airports (March 20, 2020 to December 31, 2020), as well as waiving of leases, licences, and concession fees for all businesses operating at NWT airports (April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020).

This is an important opportunity for all of us as residents of the NWT to come together and show our support for people during this difficult time. It has brought to the surface painful memories for many, and with the strength of the community, we will get through this, together. In a show of solidarity, two members of Cabinet and two Regular Members of the 19th Legislative Assembly will be attending the memorial walk and fire feeding and water ceremonies I want to thank the Dene Nation for organizing this memorial. It’s important we all stand together as a territory for those whose lives were impacted by the Residential School system, and those who never came home. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
17,2021-06-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-mining-week-2021-and-initiatives,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Mining Week 2021 and Initiatives,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, today’s mineral resource industry in the NWT is innovative, collaborative, environmentally conscious, and has the highest standards of safety. It collaborates with the GNWT and with Indigenous communities to enhance resources for capacity building and supports Indigenous participation in, and benefits received from, the mining industry. The resource sector directly employs over 3,000 people in the NWT and contributes over $800 million in spending each year. It accounts for nearly a third of NWT’s gross domestic product. A healthy and vibrant mineral exploration and development sector is critical for the NWT, its people, and our future prosperity. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment has a mandate item to increase resource exploration and development and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge a variety of initiatives underway to support this anchor industry. As with other industries, mineral resource exploration has experienced a downturn in activity and investment over the last year. The Department has provided mineral tenure support and has acted as a liaison for industry with the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer to ensure the industry was able to continue its planning and operations during the pandemic. The Work Credit Program provided a one-year, one-time relief on work requirements for 189 mineral claims in 2020-2021. We also provided a one-year deferral of mineral lease rent payments for mineral tenure interest holders.  This enabled 39 clients, with a total of 548 leases, to defer payment until 2021-2022. We continue to hear concerns from industry, and in response I am pleased to announce that mineral tenure relief will also be available in 2021-2022. This will provide additional relief for those claim holders that are unable to work their claims as the pandemic continues.  The Mining Incentive Program was also adjusted in 2020-2021 to accommodate the impacts of the global pandemic. Most of these changes are being continued for the 2021-2022 year. Changes implemented include: an increase to the maximum funding of corporate projects to 60 percent of eligible expenses, to a maximum of $240,000; NWT expenses related to self-isolation, expediting, and program logistics are eligible for MIP funding; and, the reporting deadline has been further extended for some projects that were significantly delayed due to the pandemic. As of January 2021, 12 prospector and seven corporate 2020-2021 projects were funded in the North Slave, South Slave, and Sahtu Regions for a total of $1,094,163. From its launch in 2014 to 2018, the Mining Incentive Program directly leveraged $11.8 million in company and prospector exploration spending in the NWT. Mr. Speaker, there are some bright lights on the horizon in mineral resource development. After a tumultuous 2020, the Ekati Mine has reopened, under the new ownership of Arctic Canadian Diamond Company, and recalled its workers. Gahcho Kue, under De Beers Canada and Mountain Province Diamonds continues operation and has established itself as one of the top diamond mines in the world. In December 2020, a 157.4 carat diamond was discovered at the mine.  Cheetah Resources and the rare earth minerals project at the Nechalacho site is in the demonstration phase as it advances to be the first rare earths mine in Canada, with innovative environmental standards, comprehensive training programs, and strong partnerships with the Indigenous groups in the area. The anticipated outputs are extremely promising, with the potential for a multi-generational operation providing materials for the clean energy economy. As well, in the past few weeks, Arctic Star has confirmed five kimberlites discovered around Lac de Gras on its Diagras Diamond Project, concluding its spring exploration. Their ongoing activities will include assessing diamond content and ongoing testing of targets. Mr. Speaker, this is exciting news and only scratches the surface of the NWT’s mineral potential. There is a wealth of resources in the North, and as new projects successfully move into production, we can expect increased exploration and renewed investor interest in NWT mineral resources. In anticipation of this, the established Polar Bear Diamonds trademark has a new, polished look as it works to reintroduce branded Polar Bear Diamonds into the global marketplace. A 2018 review determined that the brand remains highly recognizable in the market, and reflects a unique, authentic, and ethically sourced product. We will be highlighting some of these recent successes and continue to further build public awareness and interest in the sector during this year’s NWT Mining Week in July. I look forward to sharing the plans for what will remain a largely virtual program for this year’s Mining Week. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
18,2021-06-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-community-housing-support-program-0,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Community Housing Support Program,"Check against delivery     Mr. Speaker, every community in the Northwest Territories is different and has different needs and priorities. I am pleased to say that our Community Housing Support Program recognizes these differences and puts the priorities of local people right in the center of our planning processes.  We recognize that local people have the clearest understanding of their needs, and often of the best solutions too.  For this reason, the NWT Housing Corporation works in partnership with Indigenous governments and community agencies to develop innovative, 	community-driven housing projects of their own design.   This helps ensure local priorities are met with a variety of support options such as grants and other contributions. Support may also be in the form of policy and program design, material packages, technical expertise, land management, or surplus units when appropriate. Mr. Speaker, I have spoken about this program in the past in this Legislative Assembly and would like to provide an update today. Previously, I spoke about this program adding affordable housing to the Salt River First Nation, implementing a repair program in Fort Good Hope, and a log home project in Colville Lake among other successes. Today I would like to note even more recent successes for this program. The K’atlodeeche First Nation has used the Community Housing Support Program to implement a repair program for homes in the community. Programs like this give the community the ability to locally prioritize any repair work they want to get done. Mr. Speaker, the Hamlet of Aklavik has used funding through this program to connect to a biomass heating system. Innovative, forward-thinking, locally-driven projects like this are why we believe this program is so valuable to communities across the NWT. In Inuvik, the Community Housing Support Program has been accessed by Teepee Housing in order to renovate multiple buildings. Being able to modernize affordable housing units is another example of this program being used to turn local ambitions into reality. Mr. Speaker, one of my priorities as Minister is partnership, and this program is a great example of how by listening to each other and working together, we can make progress towards many of our shared goals. We all look forward to seeing these new projects being provided in accordance with community aspirations and recommendations. I look forward to speaking about the Community Housing Support Program in later sittings of this Legislative Assembly, sharing even more success stories. Mahsi, Mr. Speaker."

Seniors are valued members of NWT communities and they contribute by working, volunteering, and passing on knowledge and traditions through teachings, stories, and ceremonies. Seniors also sit on advisory councils and engage with governments and non-government organizations helping to develop strategy and policy. Seniors fulfill many vital roles within our society that enhances our quality of life. The NWT’s population of Seniors continues to grow. Our task is to work together to ensure we provide quality of life for them as they age.    Mr. Speaker, most Seniors want to remain in their own homes or communities. We must ensure services and supports are available to them, including home and community care services, accessible and affordable housing, and transportation and supports for their caregivers to enable them to continue to age in place with dignity. We are implementing recommendations from the Home and Community Care Review based on the Department’s Response to that Review was tabled at this time last year. We are implementing a comprehensive and internationally recognized system of assessment of vulnerable persons within Home Care programs early next year. This change will allow us to improve areas of service that have been identified as being inconsistent or inadequate.  This year we are also expanding hours that Home Care services are available in Hay River, Behchoko and Inuvik.  We will expand hours in additional communities over time. We are also engaging Indigenous governments to improve the responsiveness of the Home and Community Care program to the needs of Indigenous residents. Mr. Speaker, when Seniors are no longer able to stay in their homes with the support of Home Care, we must ensure that our long-term care facilities can provide quality care for them. We have updated our bed projections, and determined we will require fewer beds than previously anticipated.  The Department has engaged with stakeholders in Hay River and the Beaufort Delta region to discuss the new projections. We have shared our plans and received feedback from community partners on how we can enhance services in Home Care and work with other government partners to enhance aging in place.   Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories has a mandate commitment to support seniors. The Department is collaborating with the Departments of Education, Culture and Employment, Municipal and Community Affairs and the NWT Housing Corporation to help advance this mandate work. Together, we can ensure seniors continue to get the services and programs they require in their communities. We are also developing a Northwest Territories Seniors Strategy that will reflect a 	whole-of-government approach and assist in coordinating programs and services for Seniors. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I recognize World Elder Abuse Awareness Day coming up on June 15th.  We acknowledge that Seniors are a vulnerable sector in society and can be at high risk for abuse and neglect.    To help address this prevalent issue, the Department provides funding each year to the NWT Seniors Society which is specifically directed towards supporting the Network to Prevent Abuse of Older Adults. The NWT Seniors Society has taken the lead on Elder abuse initiatives by providing awareness workshops in a number of communities and by providing the toll-free Seniors Information line. Furthermore, this fall we will be launching an Elder abuse awareness campaign and planning is underway to increase training for GNWT staff to identify signs of Elder abuse. Mr. Speaker, we see where gaps exist in the services our government must provide to ensure Seniors have good quality of life through the stages of aging, and we are working to address them to ensure  Seniors are able to enjoy comfortable and dignified lives in the NWT. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
20,2021-06-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-archie-update-community-access-program,Government Website,Diane Archie: Update on Community Access Program,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, I would like to update Members and the public on the Community Access Program administered by the Department of Infrastructure. The Community Access Program provides contribution funding to communities across the Northwest Territories for the construction and rehabilitation of transportation and marine infrastructure. The program is application-based with a bi-annual intake of proposals. These projects support the development of a strong northern workforce through construction activities, economic and training opportunities. Mr. Speaker, our Regional Superintendents work closely with the communities to support projects that meet local priorities. I am pleased to report that communities take advantage of opportunity. In 2019-2020, 22 projects were supported across all five regions. This resulted in over $1 million dollars invested into transportation and marine infrastructure. Projects ranged from building and maintaining ice roads, community trails and access roads, to completing necessary marine facility upgrades. In addition to employment, the construction and maintenance of these projects provided valuable work experience in the operation of heavy equipment, modern road construction and environmental protection techniques, and project management. Mr. Speaker, the benefits of this program extend beyond the construction phase. These trail and dock projects improve quality of life for residents by increasing access for on-the-land activities like harvesting and educational programming, allowing for more convenient community and regional road transportation access for residents, and furthering economic activity like tourism. There is also a sense of community pride and accomplishment that comes along with delivering and completing these community-based priority projects. The Community Access Program provides funding for construction projects to meet specific community needs such as: access roads to hunting, fishing, wood harvesting and community recreational areas; trails connecting to the community for walking, hiking, recreational, and traditional activities; docks and wharves to support boating and marine activities, harvesting, and recreational uses; and winter access to granular sources. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Infrastructure is doing its part to support the 19th Legislative Assembly’s goal of increasing economic and training opportunities across the Northwest Territories through the Community Access Program. We have seen great uptake in the communities, and we are continuing to work closely with leaders to identify future projects to be considered under the Community Access Program in 2021-2022.

Simpson issued the  following statement on the recent COVID-19 outbreak at N.J. Macpherson and the Government of the Northwest Territories’ response: “As we near the end of the recent outbreak at N.J. Macpherson School in Yellowknife, we want to acknowledge the hard work of so many Northerners who stepped up to isolate in order to protect residents and communities at this challenging time. The collective efforts of students, parents, guardians, teachers, support staff, health care workers, and many others is another example of how we have been able to limit the spread of COVID-19 and protect our communities.  “It is heartwarming to see the way Northerners came together to support one another, and to support those who were and are still isolating or who have tested positive. This community always comes together when times are challenging, and this has been no different. You pulled together to do what was needed to prevent a much worse situation from developing – and many of you heeded the call to support the efforts however you could. Whether it was delivering groceries to families in isolation, or supporting online education efforts, you helped those who were in need. It’s what makes the North such a wonderful place to live – you are the people who make our community special. “Since this pandemic began, our health care professionals have demonstrated their dedication time and again to protecting NWT residents and their loved ones from COVID-19. We are so grateful for their commitment to keeping us all safe. “Since the first case was confirmed, a tremendous amount of work has gone on behind the scenes to understand the extent of the spread, and to contain it as quickly as possible. Because of this hard work, not only by the Chief Public Health Officer and her team, but by residents too, we have been able to prevent further spread and community transmission. As we have watched other jurisdictions struggle with rising cases, residents have played an integral role in keeping cases in the NWT low, even during one of the most significant outbreaks we have faced since the pandemic began. “We wouldn’t be in the position we are with this outbreak if it wasn’t for the collective effort of the community. To everyone who has gone above and beyond to protect the people of the NWT from further spread of this virus, thank you.”"

I am pleased to say that the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation, through its apprenticeship program, also reflects this value while also working hard to improve housing for many Northwest Territories residents. It is important to highlight providing opportunities like the apprenticeship program does not happen without collaboration. The NWT Housing Corporation works with the Department of Education, Culture, and Employment on this initiative, providing an opportunity to highlight the successes that can be achieved.  Mr. Speaker, the NWT Housing Corporation aims to hire 12 apprenticeship positions to work with Local Housing Organizations across the NWT. These apprentices are obtaining valuable classroom training while also being mentored by certified trade professionals.  These apprentices are already making valuable contributions to the people of the NWT, 	they are working diligently to learn and build up their skills.  In addition to supporting apprenticeship assignments at Local Housing Organizations the Housing Corporation is also asking general contractors bidding on new housing construction contracts to support at least one apprentice over the life of the project.   From April 2020 to May 2021, this approach has already supported 13 apprentices working on a variety of construction projects throughout the NWT. I am a firm believer in the work these apprentices do and have seen the impact of their work first-hand in many small communities across our territory. Being an apprentice is often one of the first steps in a lifetime of work in the trades. Since 2007, 19 apprentices that have worked with Local Housing Organizations are now journey certified. This includes a plumber in Behchokǫ̀, an oil burner mechanic in Délı̨nę, a carpenter in Fort Smith, and a housing maintenance serviceperson in Paulatuk.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the role the Housing Corporation has played in the careers of these journeypersons. I want to see more of this important work, I am pleased to note that under the NWTHC’s 4-year business plan we intend to increase the number of NWT Journey Certified Apprentices by 10.  Through the NWT Housing Corporations continued partnership work with ECE, our general contractors and others.  I look forward to coming back to the House and providing an update on the apprenticeship program to further highlight the successes of this program. I am confident we will continue to increase the number of certified apprentices and celebrate the skilled tradespeople of the NWT. Mahsi, Mr. Speaker."
23,2021-06-03,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-archie-marine-transportation-services,Government Website,Diane Archie: Marine Transportation Services,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, five years ago the Government of the Northwest Territories took on responsibility for the tugs, barges and marine facilities that have served our communities for decades.  Since then, Marine Transportation Services, also known as MTS, has evolved and improved and provides reliable and professional marine shipping service while also supporting the Northwest Territories’ economy and workforce development. In 2020, MTS delivered more than 6,300 tonnes of cargo and 28 million litres of fuel to communities on Great Slave Lake, the Mackenzie River, the Beaufort Delta, and the Arctic Ocean coast. Millions of liters of fuel were delivered to 20 coastal North Warning System radar sites on behalf of the Department of National Defence. Mr. Speaker, planning for the 2021 Sailing Season, our fifth season, is on schedule. The first barges are expected to depart Hay River in mid-June. This is the first of 16 tows scheduled for the season. With a robust COVID-19 mitigation plan in place to protect our communities, residents can ship and receive their cargo safely.  Thanks to funding provided by Canada, four new double-hulled barges joined the MTS fleet late last year.  These barges will be in service this season, carrying deck cargo and petroleum products to our communities and customers. For the past two summers, adventurous teenagers from Ndilǫ, Dettah, Łutselk’e and Yellowknife have joined a unique research expedition to help scientists conduct a bathymetry study of Great Slave Lake, the deepest of any lake in North America, and to install moorings in Christie Bay. These young people worked with researchers using cutting-edge technology and shared traditional knowledge of the water they grew up on. They shadowed the captain and crew of the vessel, learning about exciting and fulfilling career paths they might never have otherwise considered. This collaboration between young Northerners and world-class scientists took place on the MV Nahidik. The MTS vessel is leased to the Arctic Research Foundation, a non-government organization that collaborates with Northern and Indigenous communities, to support scientific research in the North.  I had an opportunity to visit the vessel and meet some of the students when it docked at the end of last season. I toured the vessel, was given a demonstration of some of the equipment they used, and most importantly met some of the students who had just completed this exciting expedition. Our association with the Arctic Research Foundation supports infrastructure projects and northern youth, and by advancing northern science we may better understand the effect of climate change on northern waters. MTS also supports the Canadian Coast Guard’s navigational aid program in NWT waters, performing annual inspections, overhaul, repair and maintenance to the Canadian Coast Guard’s vessels Dumit and Eckaloo at the GNWT Hay River Shipyard. This essential program places and maintains buoys and range markers each year, facilitating the safe passage of commercial marine traffic on the Mackenzie River and Great Slave Lake. Through the Marine Training Centre and with the support of Transport Canada, our partnership with the Nunavut Fisheries and Marine Training Consortium supports marine-related education and training within the NWT, creating long-term and fulfilling employment opportunities for NWT residents. Mr. Speaker, through MTS, the GNWT will continue to pursue opportunities with public and private stakeholders, and our hardworking MTS crew will continue to deliver essential supplies to our communities. Quyanainni, Mr. Speaker."

To mark this date, I will be tabling the first annual report addressing the government’s actions to respond to the Calls for Justice. Mr. Speaker, following the release of the Final Report by the National Inquiry, the GNWT committed to review and analyze the 231 Calls for Justice and assess the current programs and services they offer. In the past 18 months, we have conducted a careful and thorough review of existing programs and services, and we are currently finalizing the details to carryout preliminary engagement with key stakeholders and partners in advance of the development of a GNWT Action Plan that will respond to the Calls for Justice. While we work towards developing a comprehensive response to the Calls for Justice, scheduled for release in the Fall of 2021, the annual report I am tabling later today, describes some of the  steps already taken by the GNWT to begin to address the actions called for in the Calls for Justice. Some of these actions include: increased core funding to the Native Women’s Association of the NWT and the NWT Status of Women Council; the establishment of a new Gender Equity Division in the GNWT to expand the work of the Women’s Advisory Unit to address gender equity, gender-based violence, family violence, and women’s economic empowerment. the creation of a Gender Equity Grant Program, to complement the Women’s Initiatives Grant Program, to enhance gender equity across the NWT and provide support to community-based projects that benefit people of all genders; and, the development and implementation of the Indigenous Cultural Awareness and Sensitivity training program, which is mandatory for all GNWT employees and is available to the public free of charge. Mr. Speaker, the GNWT has also been collaborating with the Government of Canada, provinces and territories by providing input into the development of a National Action Plan on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, as well as a National Action Plan to address Gender-Based Violence. A number of announcements and events commemorating this day will take place across Canada today, including the release of the National Action Plan. The level of interest and participation by provincial and territorial governments, Indigenous governments and Indigenous organizations and communities clearly shows that the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls will not be allowed to gather dust on a shelf. The GNWT commits to, and looks forward to collaborating on, the implementation of the National Action Plan. Mr. Speaker, here in the Northwest Territories, we continue to have the second highest rates of violence against women in the country. This violence has sadly become normalized in our communities; and often leaves victims and their families to suffer in silence. This is a reality that we are not proud of, and one that we have a moral obligation to work to change. I had the privilege of attending the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. I heard first-hand the stories of families and survivors from the Northwest Territories who experienced the tragedy of a missing or murdered love one.   At the hearings, many families and survivors not only bravely shared their truths about the loss of their loved ones, but also presented recommendations on what they felt could be done so that others do not have to endure through the pain they endured.  It took immense courage to share their stories.  We have a duty to honour that by doing all that we can, individually and collectively to create a society where all Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people feel safe, respected and have equal access to quality of life. Mr. Speaker, I wish to acknowledge and remember these women and girls and their families. Survivors and families deserve not only our respect, but also our help, and the Government of the Northwest Territories will continue to support them in their healing journey. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Throughout my time being responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation, I have made it my priority to listen to community members and look for resolutions to the barriers that have been identified.  The NWT Housing Corporation has been working diligently, and in partnership with Indigenous and community governments and the private sector, to meet this commitment through a variety of programs and initiatives, including the Home Ownership Initiative. This initiative targets current Housing Corporation rental clients who have the ability to manage and succeed as homeowners.  Part of that means having the financial resources to pay for the shelter costs and utilities involved in being a homeowner.  Another part involves taking care of maintenance issues each year to ensure greater longevity of their homes.   Mr. Speaker, the NWT Housing Corporation recognizes that we must also support these households in their transition. Moving from renter to homeowner brings on more responsibilities, and people need to be prepared for that. To ensure this, tenants will be provided with the tools to become successful homeowners such as additional counselling, 	as well as maintenance and repair courses, and courses on developing financial skills. Mr. Speaker, under the initiative, rental clients enter into a forgivable loan agreement with the Housing Corporation that facilitates the transition to homeownership.  Forgivable loan agreements are for a period of three years or five years depending on the value of the home.  Approved program participants are also eligible for $20,000 in financial assistance for desired upgrades to their home. I strongly encourage anyone who may be interested in this program to reach out to their relevant NWT Housing Corporation District Office, or check the NWTHC website, for more information on this program.  Communication is also going out directly to tenants as well informing them of the initiative. Mr. Speaker, the Homeownership Initiative provides a great opportunity to add more homeowners in the NWT. Being a homeowner is something that many of us want for ourselves and our families. I am pleased that this program will be able to help make this ambition a reality for many residents. Mahsi, Mr. Speaker. "

Living without access to live music, art shows, craft fairs, traditional events and seasonal festivals because of the pandemic has highlighted the beauty, tradition, celebration and community that arts, culture, heritage and language bring into our lives.

30,2021-06-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-tourism-week-2021-and-initiatives,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Tourism Week 2021 and Initiatives,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, we continue to navigate our ever-changing circumstances as the pandemic continues around the world. After a long winter, I am sure we are all looking forward to summer, fresh air, and outdoor activities.  Northwest Territories Parks are ready for visitors and we have already received a record number of registrations from residents across the territory. In 2020, registrations from NWT residents booking overnight stays in territorial parks increased 46 %, and already this year we are seeing a further increase of 15 % on top of 2020’s impressive numbers.  Building off this momentum, the department of Industry, Tourism and Investment has recently released of a new logo and branding for NWT Parks. This new look will be reflected in all of the marketing and communication platforms for NWT Parks, allowing us to position our parks locally, nationally and globally, as premier wilderness destinations.   With that said, tourism remains one of the hardest hit industries globally. The NWT had been enjoying increases in visitors year over year and people now know, and want to experience, what our unique and beautiful home has to offer. Many Northwest Territories’ tourism businesses are adapting their company models to make sure they are ready when visitors return after travel restrictions are lifted. We, as a territory, must support our tourism operators and businesses as best we can, and we as a government, must provide the support to help keep them in business.  Mr. Speaker, last week was Tourism Week across the country. This year, to mark this national event, we developed a campaign that involved interviewing NWT residents who took advantage of the adventures and experiences available across our territory. They enthusiastically recounted their stories and shared their pictures. So many people across the NWT supported tourism operators and had, in their own words, some of their best travel experiences ever.    It is inspiring to see the resilience operators and businesses have demonstrated, and adapted to focus on opportunities for residents, while we wait for the pandemic to ease. The tourism industry has offered innovative packages for tailored to all budgets and opened residents’ eyes to the world-class experiences we have right here in our backyards. With every booking, we have shown operators how much we value their contribution to the economy. In return they have given us a new appreciation that the NWT is truly spectacular.   Mr. Speaker, Tourism Week is only one way we continue to celebrate and support the tourism industry.  Building on the momentum of past supports, like the digital boot camp training for operators to enhance their online profiles and in-market presence in partnership with Northwest Territories Tourism, and the Growth and Recovery by Investing in Tourism program, delivered through a funding collaboration with the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency.  Very soon, we hope to launch the newest support programs to bring relief to the tourism and accommodation industry; the Pandemic Relief Extension Program, or PREP, for licensed tourism operators, and the Supplement for Tourism Accommodation Relief, or STAR, for accommodation providers who have three or more rooms. The federal government has been a critical partner throughout the past year, and they are planning to continue supports through federal recovery programs. However, we know that the STAR and PREP programs are needed to continue supporting relief measures for these heavily impacted sectors.  Accommodation providers in the NWT have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Average occupancy levels for hotels reporting these statistics dropped from 65% in 2019 to 39% in 2020.  The STAR program will provide financial assistance for eligible expenses to accommodation providers in the NWT with three rooms or more and helps to continue the support for the sector that CanNor offered through their Northern Business Relief Fund.  Mr. Speaker, although there are positive signs for a tourism restart as the territorial and national vaccination programs gain momentum, the majority of tourism operators cannot maintain their businesses without some form of support. In the fall of 2020, 75 % of tourism businesses had reported a decline in revenues of 50% or more. The PREP will provide relief for eligible fixed costs to licensed tourism operators at a minimum of $2,500 to a maximum of $100,000. While home-based tourism businesses were not eligible for federal relief through the NBRF, they will be eligible for relief funding under the PREP.  Mr. Speaker, our tourism operators have demonstrated their resilience through their adaptation and refocus under never-before-seen conditions. When our travel restrictions ease, we are confident our tourism industry will rebound and continue to grow into one of the most robust areas of economic diversification for the Northwest Territories, supporting one of our primary mandates. We know that visitors are looking forward to returning, and we want to make sure our tourism industry is ready to welcome them with the unique experiences and opportunities that make our territory spectacular.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

They must receive an approved exemption letter from the CPHO before they can be exempt from self-isolation. Travellers applying for an exemption must have been in the Yukon or the NWT for at least the past 14 days. They will not qualify for an exemption if they have transited through another jurisdiction outside the Yukon or the NWT on their way to the NWT. This is the same process currently in place for travellers arriving from Nunavut.  Anyone who has already arrived in the NWT from the Yukon can also apply for a retroactive exemption by contacting ProtectNWT. This means anyone who has arrived in the NWT and is already self-isolating can still apply for an exemption. If it is approved by the CPHO, that person would no longer have to self-isolate. Travellers from the Yukon seeking an exemption from self-isolation must also: Not be symptomatic. Not have been named a contact of a person with COVID-19. Not have been notified that they were part of a COVID-19 outbreak. Not have been in close contact with someone who has travelled out of the Yukon in the past 14 days and/or is under mandatory self-isolation. Travellers will not be eligible for an exemption in the following circumstances: If they are coming from a community with travel restrictions in place. If they are coming from a community experiencing community transmission of COVID-19. If they are coming from a Yukon camp or work site that has out-of-territory workers.          Quotes “With a low number of cases, a successful vaccine roll-out and strong public health measures in place in both territories, now is an appropriate time to provide travellers from the Yukon the opportunity to be exempt from the requirement to self isolate for 14 days when entering the NWT. There are strong ties between both of our territories and this change will allow families and friends on both sides of our borders to see each other again while continuing to keep our territories and communities healthy and safe.” -Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services “We are taking a measured approach to easing our public health measures. I am now pleased that we have taken another step forward in our pandemic response. As we continue to offer vaccines to our eligible population and more NWT residents build up immunity to COVID-19, we will explore ways to reduce restrictions when the scientific evidence supports it and it is safe to do so.” -Dr. Kami Kandola, Chief Public Health Officer of the Northwest Territories Quick facts This exemption process applies to travellers from the Yukon regardless of vaccination status. Travellers must follow additional conditions set out in the exemption letters during the first 14 days upon arrival to the NWT, such as wearing non-medical masks in public places where social distancing cannot be maintained. Household members of a traveller with an exemption from self-isolation will also be exempt and will not need to self-isolate. Anyone seeking an exemption who is unsure if they are eligible should email the CPHO at CPHO@gov.nt.ca The CPHO can revoke an exemption at any time or deny a request for exemption or alter conditions based on a current public health risk assessment.

These investments connect our communities and ensure access to essential goods and services.  Regular maintenance of the Northwest Territories highway system creates the safest possible driving conditions, increases our territory’s resiliency to climate change and creates employment and training opportunities for residents.  Mr. Speaker, we can expect another busy construction season this summer. In fact, a total of $110 million dollars in improvements will be made to our highway system this year.  	In the South Slave Region, rehabilitation work is planned for Highway No. 1 on 18 kilometres of highway. This work will include highway widening, replacing culverts and replacing chipseal. This will be part of a multi-year project, with work expected to be completed by September 2023. On Highway No. 5, work is currently underway to repair chipseal surface on a six-kilometre section of the highway, which will be followed by a granular crushing program this summer. In the North Slave Region, Mr. Speaker, crews have already resumed work on the Tlicho Highway.  Construction is on schedule to be completed this fall, with 52 kilometres left to be surfaced and one last bridge to be completed. This two-lane gravel highway will provide year-round access from NWT Highway No. 3 to the community access road to Whatı̀.  This year 168 kilometres of Highway No. 3 will be chipsealed and two kilometres of rehabilitation work will take place. This work will include Right-of-Way clearing, roadway strengthening, culvert replacement and line painting, and is expected to be completed this fall. Residents will see construction zone signs along the highway where crews will be resurfacing the road, stockpiling materials and conducting asphalt and chipseal repairs.    On Highway No. 4, the Ingraham Trail, roughly five kilometres will be rehabilitated. Work will include repairing dips, widening the embankment, replacing culverts and chipsealing.   On Highway No. 6, the Fort Resolution Highway, chipsealing will be carried out to roughly 20 kilometres. In the Dehcho Region, rehabilitation work will take place this summer on Highway No. 7, the Liard Highway. Crews will focus on widening the embankment and replacing culverts. Work is expected to be completed in September 2023.  Mr. Speaker, in the Beaufort Delta Region, some construction will take place on Highway No. 8, the Dempster Highway. Rehabilitation work including embankment widening and bush clearing will take place along three to four kilometres of highway. Additionally, the marine by-pass highway widening will also take place along three kilometres of highway.   As temperatures rise and construction season begins, I would like to thank the dozens of dedicated workers who are maintaining and improving our highways every day. Your work is essential in the North. I would also like to remind drivers to watch for highway crews, slow down in construction zones and obey signs. I want all our Infrastructure employees and our contractor employers to return home safe to their families. Mr. Speaker, our government will continue to work closely with all of our public and private sector partners so we can continue to build a transportation network that meets the current needs of our citizens and the needs of generations to come.

Mr. Speaker, many NWT residents are living with some form of disability. They are our neighbors, co-workers, family members, leaders, and friends.  We are grateful for the contributions that persons with disabilities make in the territory. For this reason, we continue to advance work to ensure all residents are able to participate fully in all communities, without barriers.   National AccessAbility Week runs until June 5th this year. It is the week where we celebrate the contributions of persons with disabilities and recognize the important work being done to remove barriers to accessibility and inclusion in all communities.  Mr. Speaker, this year’s theme in the NWT is Inclusion and AccessAbility; Nothing About Us Without Us! What does this mean for us as a territory or as individuals? It means it is the responsibility of each of us to work with, and include people who have disabilities, to ensure equal access to all the rights and freedoms each member of our society enjoys. Working in partnership with multiple GNWT departments, the Department of Health and Social Services is currently fulfilling the objectives outlined in the NWT Disability Strategic Framework. The shared vision  is to increase financial security and reduce poverty; to build awareness and knowledge through education and training; to improve transition planning and options; to encourage universal design and living options, and to improve access to and the quality of caregiver supports. This is a significant undertaking, Mr. Speaker, and one that requires thoughtful insight into how best to create inclusiveness within the public realm, while also providing individual supports that assist in creating a foundation for success for persons with disabilities. For that reason, we recently put out a call to hear directly from people with lived experience by creating an NWT Supported Living Review Advisory Group.  This group will be comprised of six to ten members of the public who either have a disability or who is the caregiver of a person with a disability.  It will give NWT residents a voice to provide knowledge and advice during the review of our Supported Living services for persons with disabilities.  This is an important step toward the government embracing the “nothing about us without us” approach that is so important to residents. Mr. Speaker, while we as a government continue to work hard to achieve accessibility for all NWT residents, we also rely on others to provide assistance for persons with disabilities.  Every year, we have an award ceremony to recognize NWT individuals and organizations who contribute to making the lives of persons with disabilities more accessible and inclusive.  At this year’s Persons with Disabilities Accessibility and Inclusion Awards event, I will present awards as the Minister Responsible for Persons with Disabilities, along with representatives from the NWT Human Rights Commission, and the NWT Disabilities Council.  Due to COVID restrictions, the event this year is being presented in the form of a video, which will be made available on June 4th on the Department of Health and Social Services website, as well as on social media.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate this year’s award recipients.  Laurie McLean of Yellowknife is the recipient of the Minister’s award for Accessibility and Inclusion.  Samantha Morandin of Yellowknife is the recipient of the NWT Disabilities Council Community Champion Award and the Zhati Koe Friendship Centre in Fort Providence is the recipient of the Human Rights Commission Accessibility Award.     These individuals are all deserving recipients, they have shown a true inclusive community spirit and their impactful work removes barriers for persons with disabilities in our communities.   Mr. Speaker, we all have roles to play in promoting inclusion and accessibility for every member of society and the government will continue to take meaningful steps toward a vision of equity, accessibility, and participation for persons with disabilities in the NWT. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

We are also committed to providing opportunities to create a more diverse, inclusive and representative public service.  Today, I am pleased to announce that the Department of Finance is launching Building Capacity with Indigenous Governments, a new program to support up to ten two-way secondment arrangements between the GNWT and Indigenous governments per year. Ce programme aidera les gouvernements autochtones à bonifier leur potentiel en matière de ressources humaines tout en donnant des occasions à leurs employés et au GTNO d’acquérir de l’expérience et de transmettre des connaissances. The program will support the secondment of employees between governments for immersive experiences about how our respective governments operate. Mr. Speaker, this program was developed collaboratively. Representatives from the Department of Finance worked with officials from Indigenous governments over a series of engagement sessions to learn more about the unique needs of their organizations including human resources. Cette collaboration aidera à faire en sorte que le programme répond aux besoins des gouvernements autochtones et des résidents qu’ils servent. Plus important encore, l’ambition de ce programme est beaucoup plus qu’un transfert de savoir et de compétences entre différents organismes. Il s’agit d’une voie supplémentaire pour échanger nos expériences et apprendre des points de vue de chacun. At its full potential, the program will provide opportunities for more direct exchanges of ideas, deepen relationships, and build greater trust and understanding as partners.

The Next 5 Years: NWT Film and Media Sector Strategy and Action Plan (2021-2026) with a new Producers Incentive Pilot Program (PIPP) to continue developing and investing in the Northwest Territories’ (NWT) Film and Media sector. From February to July 2020, the Department of ITI and the NWT Film Commission (NWTFC) held engagements with Film and Media sector members to identify any gaps in programs and services within the sector. The 2020 NWT Film and Media Sector Stakeholder Engagement Report outlines member input on the Take One: NWT Film Strategy and Action Plan (2015-2020), and the hopes for the sector. The report details a vision to grow and develop film and media into a nationally competitive and sustainable economic sector for the NWT. When asked what success would look like for the NWT film and media sector in five years, the majority of NWT film and media professionals spoke of feature films being produced in the NWT by NWT residents; further developing a roster of skilled resident professionals; and more full-time jobs and mentorships in the territory’s film industry. The new Producer Incentive Pilot Program (PIPP) invests in NWT producers by providing support at the development stage to incentivize and empower NWT production companies to develop professional quality, commercial-ready projects to be produced in the territory. PIPP  begins delivery on June 1, 2021, as a standalone one-year pilot program with a program budget of $100,000. The program will provide qualified NWT producers with funding support to develop projects for presentation to broadcasters, co-productions and other financiers.  Rolling, Action! outlines 15 actions and investments in three focus areas:  managing and improving our programming; showcasing and promoting our film and media sector; and developing skills and collaborating. These focus areas and actions are designed to achieve identified short- and medium-term outcomes on the way to establishing the NWT’s film and media sector as a distinct contributor to diversifying the NWT economy. In 2018, the business of audio-visual and interactive media (including film, video and broadcasting) contributed $9.27 million to the NWT’s GDP, $15.5 million to the NWT’s economic output, and 58 jobs. The NWT film and media Sector are a part of ITI’s mandate to increase economic diversification by supporting growth in non-extractive sectors and setting regional diversification targets.  Quote ""Thanks to a committed group of professionals with an unwavering belief in a vibrant NWT film and media sector, we have experienced tremendous success and year-over-year growth in the sector. With these stakeholders and partners at the helm, and industry best practices guiding the way, this strategy identifies actions and investments that will enable the NWT’s film and media sector to contribute to  the recovery, diversification and growth of the NWT economy. The new Producer Incentive Pilot Program is a great step towards achieving these outcomes.” - Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment Quick facts The three themes that emerged out of the engagements as critical to the growth and development of the film and media sector in the NWT are professional development funding, governance, and story and intellectual property. As of 2018, the film and media sector contributed $9.27 million to the NWT’s GDP, $15.5 million to the NWT’s economic output, and 58 jobs. New programs will help sustain and provide development and investment for sector stakeholders over the coming five years.  Related links Producers Incentive Pilot Program Rolling, Action!

38,2021-05-31,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-wildfire-prevention-and-firesmart,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Wildfire Prevention and FireSmart ,"Check against delivery    Mr. Speaker, wildfire season is here and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, or ENR, and our dedicated wildfire management team are ready.  Today, I would like to provide an update on what ENR has done to get ready for the 2021 fire season, and the role residents and communities across the Northwest Territories have in preventing wildfires.  Mr. Speaker, preparation for the wildfire season begins with people. To that end, we have made sure we have well-trained and well-prepared staff and contractors in-place to respond to wildfire across every region, and they are all ready to go.  We have 37 four-person crews at-the-ready to attack early and fast. This includes 10 Indigenous-owned companies contracted to provide local firefighting services. This will serve not only to keep us safe, but to build and maintain the skills needed for careers in forest management.  Mr. Speaker, protecting our people and our communities is top-of-mind as we deliver these essential services in a pandemic. Our wildfire team has maintained strong COVID-19 protocols since the pandemic began in 2020, and made some adjustments to how we fight fires to keep people safe.  This year is no different. We continue to have exposure control plans in place designed to protect our staff from the office to the fire-line. We have hired additional staff in smaller communities to make it much less likely we will need to bring in firefighters from other regions or from outside the NWT.  We have also added two additional air tankers to help us respond quickly when fires are small. We have specific requirements for firefighters if they go to other jurisdictions to help, and we’ve worked closely with those jurisdictions to ensure best practices are followed.  Mr. Speaker, our government is targeting a significant reduction in human caused fires in the NWT over the next five years, and everyone has a role to play.    It starts with personal responsibility. It is about taking that extra time to douse your campfire with water. It is about getting a burn permit if you’re cleaning up yard waste and following the defined safety requirements. It is about doing your part to stay informed on wildfire danger in your area and choosing not to have open fires if the fire danger is high or extreme, and it is about understanding that fire restrictions are put in place for a reason and following them.  Mr. Speaker, our government invests in outreach and education to give folks the tools to prevent wildfires. Our staff work with schools and community organizations to provide practical advice to those heading out on the land.  They work with local governments to give support and advice as they implement community wildfire protection plans.  Mr. Speaker, even with best efforts toward prevention, there will always be wildfires. That is where FireSmart principles come in. FireSmart is a practical guide to proactively reduce the risk of damage to your home or cabin before a wildfire. Many of the actions can be done easily and do not cost much and every single one is proven to make a real difference. We are encouraging individuals and communities to step up and do what they can.  We are planning events to build FireSmart awareness at the grassroots level. We are getting these principles out online and over the airwaves. We are ready to work with home and cabin owners looking for FireSmart advice.  Mr. Speaker, as the ground dries out and fire danger rises, I urge everyone to take their responsibility for preventing and protecting against wildfire seriously. It’s good for our territory, and it’s good for our firefighters.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
39,2021-05-31,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-emerging-stronger-covid-19-social-and-economic-recovery-plan,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Emerging Stronger: COVID-19 Social and Economic Recovery Plan,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenging time for all of us. Like all jurisdictions, our initial response was focused on public health measures. To date, we have been successful in protecting the health and safety of our residents thanks to the actions we took early, and the commitment from residents to follow the public health orders and recommendations in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. As we continue our efforts to be one of the first jurisdictions in the country to successfully implement a vaccination program, we have also been focused on our social and economic recovery. Mr. Speaker, at the appropriate time later today, I will be pleased to table Emerging Stronger, a social and economic recovery plan for the Northwest Territories. The pandemic has exposed economic and social gaps in our society, and has increased the urgency to address these issues. Emerging Stronger complements our mandate by highlighting areas of responsiveness and further growth. Emerging Stronger identifies the lessons learned from the urgency and intensity of the pandemic, and examines these in the context of our government’s existing mandate, to present a set of actions the GNWT will take to support long-term social and economic recovery. While our government’s mandate itself provides a foundational plan for strengthening the economic and social conditions in the NWT that precedes the pandemic, Emerging Stronger builds on our existing commitments to strengthen the GNWT’s vision for social and economic development post-pandemic. Emerging Stronger includes, for example, commitments to review NWT Housing Corporation policies, accelerate work on the Alcohol Strategy, and increase support for addictions programs, as well as efforts to diversify the economy through remediation activities. Mr. Speaker, our success in social and economic recovery from the pandemic depends on partnerships. Emerging Stronger was shared with Indigenous governments and Indigenous organizations for comment earlier this month, and we have discussed it with community governments and the Business Advisory Council. I would also like to thank the Standing Committee on Accountability and Oversight for their comments on the plan. We have incorporated Committee’s input, and we will be welcoming comments and feedback from the public on the social and economic recovery plan on an ongoing basis to inform our actions as we move forward with recovery efforts. Mr. Speaker, the pandemic is ongoing and many jurisdictions in Canada have been hit hard. The NWT’s recovery planning needs to be responsive to changing circumstances. All actions must take into consideration our fiscal situation, and the variability and unpredictability of the pandemic’s severity and duration in the NWT, across Canada, and worldwide. I am hopeful that we can tackle our biggest social and economic challenges with the same urgency we saw in our initial response to the pandemic. That work involves strong partnerships and collaboration with Indigenous governments, communities and other stakeholders. The plan notes the expectation for on-going engagement, including through the GNWT’s budget dialogues as work to plan recovery efforts together continues over the near, medium and long-terms. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the actions this government took early in the pandemic to support individuals and businesses, particularly vulnerable populations and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic. I believe that Emerging Stronger will be an important tool for continuing social and economic recovery as we emerge from the impacts of the pandemic. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
40,2021-05-31,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-indian-residential-school-mass-grave-kamloops,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Indian Residential School Mass Grave in Kamloops,"Check against delivery.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin my statement today I want to acknowledge that many people, including those that work in and around this Legislative Assembly and government, are being retraumatized by the confirmation of the mass grave of Indigenous children at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.  I am providing this notice so that those who are hurting may choose not to listen if they will be triggered by what I say. Mr. Speaker, the confirmation of the remains of 215 Indigenous children at the Kamloops Indian Residential School last week is a reminder of a dark chapter of Canadian history rooted in the attempted cultural genocide and assimilation of Indigenous people across the country.  We are all grieving at the confirmation of the mass grave by the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation. This is a devastating moment for so many, especially Indigenous people who have experienced first-hand the system that tried so hard to destroy them and steal their culture and language from them. On behalf of the Government of the Northwest Territories, I want to extend our deepest condolences to Chief Roseanne Casimir, the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation, and to the families of the 215 spirits who can now come home to rest after all these years. Mr. Speaker, this is not just a dark chapter in Canadian history. It is part of our present day, as it continues to live on through the multi-generational trauma that has impacted Indigenous people for decades. Because of the physical, psychological, spiritual and sexual abuse experienced by those torn away from their homes by the Government of Canada and the Catholic Church, the impacts continue to live on in Indigenous communities across the Northwest Territories, and Canada.  Mr. Speaker, this is a harmful reminder to so many that the history of the residential school system continues to have a long-lasting impact on families and survivors.  In the Northwest Territories, most of us know someone who attended a residential school, and we have all felt the impact of the legacy it left and will for generations to come. It is important we all take care of one another during moments like this. Now is the time for us all to check in on the people in our lives who may be having difficulty as a result of this.  I want to say now to anyone who may be struggling, you are not alone. For immediate assistance to those who may need it, the National Indian Residential School Crisis Line is available 24-hours a day at 1-866-925-4419.  Mr. Speaker, we are mourning the many young lives who never made it home from that school, their lives cut short at the hands of colonialism. This is a difficult time for anyone who has experienced the horrors of the residential school system, and the many generations of Indigenous people who have been impacted by it.  Flags are flying at half-mast today. We want to honour the memory of the thousands of children who were sent to residential schools, for those who never returned, and honour the families whose lives were forever changed. Mr. Speaker, there is a great deal of work that remains to address reconciliation in the Northwest Territories and Canada, and we continue to move forward on that journey. While it will be long, and at times difficult, the GNWT is committed to this journey, every step of the way.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE), met with education leaders on Tuesday, May 25, 2021 to discuss several priority initiatives. Minister Simpson and Dehcho Chair Renalyn Pascua-Matte opened the virtual meeting with remarks about the latest information on the flood situation in Fort Simpson and Jean Marie River and the planned reopening of schools in both communities this week.  Minister Simpson  reiterated his thanks to the Dehcho region’s education leaders and staff for their extraordinary efforts during the flooding. as well as to education leaders for their coordinated efforts during recent COVID-19 related school closures in Yellowknife, Dettah, Ndılǫ and Behchokǫ̀, Minister Simpson provided updates on Education Act modernization, JK -12 Curriculum Renewal and the 2030 Early Learning and Child Care Strategy initiatives. Minister Simpson noted that engagement has been very high with these initiatives, with nearly 60 formal engagements taking place to date, as well as nearly 580 online survey responses submitted. Education staff provided an update on the COVID-19 situation, noting that most schools have now safely reopened since the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) updated the orders on school closures. Staff also took questions and provided information around preparations for the upcoming 2021-22 school year. Education leaders discussed major Indigenous Language Revitalization (ILR) initiatives, including the Mentor-Apprentice Program, where a mentor fluent in an Indigenous language teaches a language learner through immersion. Programs such as this aim to slow down and eventually reverse the decline of an Indigenous language, as well as educate, empower and mobilize communities. Education leaders also engaged in discussion on the Skills 4 Success initiative. Skills 4 Success is a GNWT-wide initiative that is about improving employment success for NWT residents. Education leaders offered valuable feedback toward developing a new Skills 4 Success action plan, including on the need to strengthen the connections between the JK-12 education system and post-secondary education and training. The Minister and education leaders highlighted the importance of promoting skilled trades, noting that skilled tradespeople will play a critical in advancing the economic and social aspirations of the people of the Northwest Territories. Minister Simpson and education leaders are scheduled to meet next on June 8. Quotes: “I’m pleased that we were able to focus on priority initiatives today, and update education leaders on the work ECE is doing to improve student outcomes. From Indigenous Languages Revitalization and Education Act modernization, to JK-12 curriculum renewal and Skills 4 Success, there is exciting work happening to improve educational outcomes and employment opportunities for students in the territory. It has been a busy and demanding few months for our communities and our schools, and I appreciate how education leaders and school staff have handled these ongoing challenges, while continuing work on these important initiatives.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment “We thank the Minister and ECE staff for updating education leaders on these exciting programs and initiatives and allowing us the chance to discuss and ask questions. We are pleased with the work being done to improve student outcomes in the NWT, particularly in our small communities through programs such as Northern Distance Learning and the Mentor-Apprentice Program.” -Erin Currie, DEA Chair, Yellowknife Catholic Schools     For more information contact: Briony Grabke Manager, Communications and Public Affairs Department of Education, Culture and Employment briony_grabke@gov.nt.ca   Erin Currie DEA Chair, Yellowknife Catholic Schools erin.currie@ycs.nt.ca"

This is their top priority at this time.   “In anticipation of the flooding, more than two dozen home care residents and elders were evacuated from the community to Inuvik on Friday May 28th. Aurora College has provided accommodations to a number of these residents, while others are staying with family and friends in Inuvik.    “Residents are being evacuated by planes from both Aklak Air and North-Wright Airways. Officials with the Emergency Management Organization (EMO) are continuing to monitor the situation on the ground closely.  “The Inuvik Region EMO has been working closely with the Community of Aklavik to support the movement of evacuees to Inuvik. They are also working with the Town of Inuvik and regional partners to put evacuation arrangements in place to host evacuees. The territorial EMO has been supporting the Regional EMO with resources as required.   “Arrangements have been made to house evacuees at the Midnight Sun Complex in Inuvik, with 50 cots set up and the capacity for 50 more if needed, and the Town of Inuvik will be supporting efforts to provide food to evacuees.    “As river break-up and the flooding risk continues to change rapidly it is still too early to speculate on potential damages or recovery requirements. The GNWT is closely monitoring the situation and will be addressing these issues as quickly as possible when it is safe and possible to do so.   “This is a difficult and challenging time for everyone in Akalvik right now. As residents did with the flooding in Jean Marie River, Fort Good Hope and Fort Simpson earlier this month, we hope that everyone will come together and support those impacted.”    "

44,2021-05-28,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-improving-student-educational-outcomes,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Improving Student Educational Outcomes ,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, the health and prosperity of our territory begins with how well we prepare our children and youth to succeed in life. Making sure that every student from every background and region in the Northwest Territories, or NWT, has equitable access to relevant, culturally appropriate and quality education will ultimately lead to improved well-being across the North and within all our communities.  The findings from both the Office of the Auditor General and the Education Renewal and Innovation Evaluation from 2020 are clear in outlining the main challenge we face: key achievement gaps especially for Indigenous students and students in small communities. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share some of the priority actions that are underway to make the required changes to improve education outcomes for all NWT students to the same level as the rest of Canada. Since March 2021, the Department has been engaging Indigenous government partners, education leaders, the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association, parents, and the public on what will be one of our government’s most significant undertakings to date: modernizing the NWT Education Act. The goal of modernizing the Education Act is to ensure there are system-wide improvements to meet the needs of students across the territory.  To date, we have received nearly 600 responses to our surveys, and held more than 25 meetings with Indigenous governments, partners and stakeholders and held seven public virtual town hall meetings.  I encourage everyone to take part in this engagement, whether by participating in a virtual meeting, taking a survey, providing a written submission, or calling the Department before June 30th. Hearing from NWT residents is crucial for ensuring a modernized education system that reflects the values, needs, goals and aspirations of all NWT residents. Another area of active engagement is our discussion regarding Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 curriculum. Our curriculum needs renewal to ensure that it continues to meet the needs and interests of our Northern students and our communities and aligns with the vision of helping all our students become capable people.     I am happy to share that to date the Department has held over 30 engagement sessions, which have included Indigenous governments, education bodies, the NWT Teachers’ Association, and the NWT Association of Communities.  We have also been collecting input from the public online.  All this feedback will be reflected in a “What We Heard Report,” which will help inform the decision on how to move forward to meet the expectations of the residents of the NWT. Mr. Speaker, access to quality early learning and childcare opportunities is crucial to improving educational outcomes for our students across the entire education continuum. The Department is meeting with licensed early learning and childcare programs, Indigenous governments, and other partners in the development of a 2030 Early Learning and Child Care Strategy for the NWT.  The development of the strategy will focus on improving the availability and affordability of early learning and childcare throughout the NWT, and highlight the elements needed to advance universal childcare in our territory by exploring solutions for reducing the costs while ensuring quality child care for families.   Mr. Speaker, there is more.  In a continued effort to offer quality high school education to our small communities, the expansion of Northern Distance Learning is almost complete.   We are excited to welcome the communities of Gamètı̀, Wekweètı̀, Norman Wells and Colville Lake to Northern Distance Learning, bringing the total number of participating small community schools to 19. As well, the Indigenous Our Languages Curriculum has been approved and is being taught in all NWT schools that offer Indigenous language instruction.  Ongoing teacher training is happening remotely, and resources continue to be developed to support this exciting new Indigenous language curriculum with a goal of revitalizing the traditional languages of our residents.  Addressing gaps in student outcomes requires supports beyond the scope of education.  Because of this, the Department continues to work closely with the Department of Health and Social Services on initiatives that actively support the well-being and mental health of our students and their families.  This includes the planning for the final phase of the role out of the Child and Youth Community Counsellor programs into the South Slave Region this upcoming 2021-2022 school year.  Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to improving the education system and the outcomes for all our students.  We are committed to effective and collaborative engagement on these critical initiatives so that together we will succeed in revitalizing our education system, achieving equitable access to education, and helping our children and youth have the knowledge and skills they need to become capable people.  Masi, Mr. Speaker. "

These past few weeks have been an incredibly trying time for residents who have been directly impacted by flooding in their communities. There is never a good time for emergencies involving natural disasters but responding to one during a pandemic has added to a trying and difficult time. As I have said many times in the past, the North is a place where residents come together during times of need with offers of help and assistance, and I am pleased to say this was once again the case during this summer’s flood season. Mr. Speaker, the Emergency Management Organization was activated early in the spring and has been, and continues to, provide assistance to communities as our flood season continues. The EMO is an active partner in all emergency responses. In particular, I want to acknowledge the quick and effective response with the communities of Hay River, Kátł’odeeche First Nation, Jean Marie River and Fort Simpson over the past few weeks. The EMO continues to monitor and work collaboratively with communities to address emergency needs on an ongoing, real time basis.  The membership of the EMO has been working to ensure that activities related to business continuity and resumption of services continue, including making accommodations available where possible for those impacted. As communities have seen the water level drop and it has become safe to do so, staff have traveled to affected communities to meet with residents to discuss their needs, start to assess damage and mitigation concerns, and assess how the GNWT can provide support. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the communities of Fort Providence and Fort Smith who have kindly hosted evacuees, as well the Town of Hay River who, after undergoing an evacuation of their own, opened up their community to evacuees from other areas of the territory. I would also like to show appreciation for all of the donations that have been organized for the affected communities. The deep connection that we have with one another is evident with these generous actions by Northerners.    Flood response is community driven and supported by the EMO, because much of the important work happens on the ground, many actions taken within the communities may be overlooked. As such, I would also like to recognize the significant contributions of the front-line workers and the hundreds of volunteers that offered their time and effort to assist with flood responses. To our affected communities and residents, we know this is a challenging time, and we are working with community governments to ensure that you remain safe and have the supports you need. The GNWT will continue to work with communities on the ongoing recovery efforts, and again on behalf of Cabinet, thank you to everyone involved in the flood efforts so far.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
46,2021-05-28,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-flooding-northwest-territories,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Flooding in the Northwest Territories ,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, the recent floods have been devastating for many Northerners who have experienced damage to their community, property and to their livelihoods.  I witnessed the anxiety and stress in the voices and faces of people in my own community as water levels rose and homes and businesses were threatened and many were affected. In the face of this adversity, I also saw firsthand how communities, leaders and Northerners can rise to meet challenges they must overcome. I am very proud of how our communities have met this challenge. I am very thankful to local leaders like Mayor Whelly, Chief Sanguez, and Chief Masuzumi who remained focused and provided strong local leadership throughout this crisis.   I am awed by the hundreds of volunteers from within our flooded communities and from across the territory  who have stepped up to help their neighbours in need. I also take pride in how all levels of government, municipal, Indigenous, territorial and federal, continue to come together to keep folks safe and to provide assistance. On behalf of Cabinet I want to say thank you to everyone. We still have a long road ahead to recovery, but we have proven just how strong we are in the face of adversity. We should all take some comfort in the fact that we live in a place where people take care of one another. Mr. Speaker, I am also proud of the role the Department of Environment and Natural Resources has played in the territory’s coordinated emergency response to date. I believe that many ENR staff went above and beyond during this emergency. Department hydrologists have been instrumental in warning the territory of the unprecedented high water levels on NWT rivers this year. They have been assessing water levels all year long, and snow this past winter. The team felt it necessary to raise awareness of the potential for floods in November, as well as in March and April, hoping to warn cabin owners, harvesters, and residents most at risk. They continue to analyze radar imagery and real-time data to give regional and local emergency management officials the information they need to plan for flooding and to prepare communities about what to expect.   Our regional offices and the staff within them played key roles in regional and local emergency operation centres in every region and community impacted by flooding. Coordinating with local leadership and community emergency management organizations, ENR gathered and prioritized the communities’ requests, providing relevant assistance and support wherever possible. As a result, I am proud to say our wildfire crews were immediately redeployed to help with the flood response in Jean Marie River, Fort Simpson, and in Fort Good Hope. Fire crews continue to assist with clean up in NWT communities where flood risk remains. Local officers, and those redeployed from other regions, continue to support affected communities, and have since the flooding began.  At the request of local EMOs and leadership, ENR officers, fire crews and other staff quickly sprang into action to help out with a range of on-the-ground actions to help people affected by these floods.  From the start, they helped folks that had to leave their homes and assisted with any of the community’s relevant requests and needs.  ENR provided tents, stoves and other supplies to people in Fort Simpson and Jean Marie River, and helped them set up these temporary camps.  To help keep residents safe during this time, officers conducted regular bear patrols around emergency camping areas, and set up a mobile station at Jean Marie River.  After further assessing the needs of residents on the ground, ENR staff delivered food hampers and fish donated by the community of Deline to evacuees, and helped chop firewood for people’s camps while they waited to return to their homes.  The Department also assisted delivering donated supplies to the communities of Jean Marie River and Fort Simpson. When flooding occurred at Little Buffalo River, fire crews and Renewable Resource Officers ensured residents were safe, and assisted in securing their cabins and retrieving their belongings. As break up moves down the Mackenzie, ENR staff continue to support residents and fulfill critical emergency response roles, as part of the broader Government of the Northwest Territories coordinated effort. I want to thank the staff for their tireless efforts to date, and for the work to come. Mr. Speaker, I also know that this Department and our government as a whole will not stop its involvement in this response. As the focus shifts towards rebuilding from these devastating floods the GNWT will continue to play its role by supporting communities and residents in various ways. Mr. Speaker, we know there are harvesters and trappers who have had, not only their homes, but their livelihoods significantly affected. Their cabins, traplines, and the equipment they rely upon have been damaged. Indigenous harvesters and trappers who have been impacted by the flooding, please contact your closest regional Environment and Natural Resources office, as compensation may be available.     Mr. Speaker, the floods along the Mackenzie River have been devastating, but they have shown us that the northern spirit is alive and well.  We take care of our own and we make things happen when working together for a common cause is needed. I have witnessed firsthand the amazing resilience of Northerners and our communities.  I have seen the sense of empowerment in residents, who know that we can work together to overcome events like this.

I know all residents are now well into the ‘COVID-19 fatigue’ stage. We all want to see things back to normal and public health measures lifted. Mr. Speaker, since the start of the pandemic, protecting NWT residents against COVID-19 has been this government’s biggest priority. We have known from the start that vaccines would be an essential part of our strategy and it is one of the most important factors the Chief Public Health Officer is considering in her decision-making about easing restrictions.   Getting vaccinated is the most important thing people can do to protect themselves and their communities from the COVID-19 virus.  Many residents across the territory continue to make the choice to get vaccinated to protect their loved ones and I want to thank those who have made that decision.  As of May 25th, 60 percent of NWT residents 18 years of age and older are fully vaccinated and 68 percent have received their first dose.  Additionally since the announcement on May 5th to expand our COVID-19 vaccine program to include the Pfizer-BioNTech product, which is approved for the 12-17 year-old age group, almost 1200 young people from Yellowknife, Dettah, Ndılǫ, and Behchokǫ̀ have already received their first dose.  I want to thank all the young people who have come forward to be vaccinated so far. Not only are you protecting yourselves from COVID-19, but you are adding another layer of protection to your community and the territory. You should be very proud. To the youth who are still considering whether the vaccine is right for them, check out the territorial medical director’s video which will be coming out shortly. Dr. Pegg answers questions from NWT youth about COVID-19 vaccines to help you make an informed decision. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the parents, guardians, teachers, and health care providers who have taken the time to talk with youth in their lives about the COVID-19 vaccine. Now that an additional 3,510 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech have arrived in the NWT, we are ready to continue school-based clinics for youth aged 12 to17 in all other communities. This week, we started with the regional hubs of Hay River, Fort Smith, and Inuvik and teams will move on to other, more remote communities in the following weeks. The GNWT plans to offer youth in all NWT communities at least one dose of the vaccine before the end of the school year. Details will be updated on the online vaccine schedule on an ongoing basis  Mr. Speaker, the NWT has just come through a difficult period because of an outbreak declared at a Yellowknife school. This outbreak resulted in schools closing for a short period in Yellowknife, Dettah, Ndılǫ and Behchokǫ̀ and the introduction of new measures such as mandatory masking for indoor public spaces in these communities. The decisive action by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer contained the outbreak to 71 cases. There was no community spread and all COVID-19 infections from this outbreak occurred in students and staff from the school or their households while they were in isolation. I would like to express my thanks to our dedicated health care staff for their work in this outbreak, working long hours to identify contacts of the outbreak and get individuals tested. I would also like to express my gratitude to all the support staff, including 8-1-1 staff, communications and policy staff who worked hard to and moved quickly to get the information out to the public. There was a substantial amount of information and it changed quickly. These communications professionals did their best to support the needs of residents during that time.  Finally, I would like to thank the people who were required to isolate during the outbreak. I know this has been very difficult for many of you, but without all of you isolating responsibly and doing what was required under difficult circumstances, this outbreak could have turned out much differently. For that, the government and residents thank you. Mr. Speaker, while this outbreak demanded our focus for the past three weeks, the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer continues to work on updating Emerging Wisely, the plan to ease public health measures gradually and safely. I know we are all eagerly awaiting the release of this updated plan. The Chief Public Health Officer has said it will be released in June. It will remove the phased approach in the original Emerging Wisely and look at external and internal factors to determine what measures can be eased with an emphasis on personal responsibility for mitigation of an individual or household’s risk. Overall vaccine uptake in the NWT will be a key internal factor to determine what measures can be eased.  This is the best measure to ensure residents are protected and we can re-open with confidence. The updated Emerging Wisely will also look at final travel and border restrictions being lifted once COVID-19 cases decrease in Canada and vaccination rates rise across the country. Mr. Speaker, I know keeping COVID-19 at bay has been a long, difficult battle and we have asked a lot of residents, communities and businesses the past 14 months. I would like to thank them for stepping up. With the COVID-19 situation improving beyond our borders and with the updated Emerging Wisely outlining the path forward in the NWT pandemic response, we can look forward to easing public health measures over the coming weeks and months. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
48,2021-05-27,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-sessional-statement-may-2021,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Sessional Statement – May 2021,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by welcoming all my colleagues back to the Chamber for this sitting of the 19th Legislative Assembly. I look forward to providing updates on key issues, and mandate priorities, as well as hearing from Regular Members on issues important to residents over the course of the next seven sitting days.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take some time to talk about community, and how that term has a renewed meaning not only with trying to address COVID- 19, but also in the last few weeks due to the impacts of flooding in many regions in the NWT. It has been incredible to watch residents support one another during such a challenging times.  Hundreds of residents have been impacted by the flooding, some having lost everything, others facing significant repairs and efforts to replace possessions they lost. Some of what has been lost cannot be replaced. Mr. Speaker, no matter the challenges we are faced with in the Northwest Territories, there is a sense of community that is special and unique to us alone. No matter the emergency we are faced with; a global pandemic, forest fires, or flooding; no one can take that sense of community away from us.  Every single person in the NWT has been negatively impacted by this pandemic, and yet the community still came together to support others in need. During the early days of the flooding, residents, businesses, and organizations stepped up and volunteered their time and money to help those who were impacted by the floods.  You opened your doors to your neighbours who needed a warm bed to sleep in since they could not sleep in their own. You donated airplanes full of groceries, and hundreds of thousands of dollars to the United Way. Let us not forget the 2,500 pieces of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Mr. Speaker. People came together to support those who needed it the most.  Our government, Mr. Speaker, was there to provide support however it was needed. Local leadership on the ground, with the support of Municipal and Community Affairs Emergency Management Organization and volunteers worked day and night to ensure residents were safe, and had what they needed. A multi-departmental effort helped to provide staff and supplies, including a temporary medical centre, to support efforts on the ground.  The responsibility of managing a community emergency rests with local governments, and when they made requests for additional support, we were there to ensure they were able to take care of their residents. And as recovery continues and the flood damage is assessed, I want residents to know that we will be there to support you in your recovery.   Mr. Speaker, the Northwest Territories is vast, twice the size of Texas. Our 33 communities are spread out, and in many instances, separated by great distances. But when one community needs our support, the Northwest Territories stands strong with them.  To everyone who contributed to the flood relief efforts,you are what makes the Northwest Territories such a special place to live. Thank you.  Mr. Speaker, the strength and resilience of our communities and residents across the Northwest Territories shines brightly as we continue to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the NJ MacPherson outbreak in Yellowknife is an example of over a year of work preparing for the possibility of such an event. Safety and preparedness have been our top priorities since the pandemic began, and the response to contain this outbreak is an example of the hard work of so many to protect residents and communities. The response of our health care and support professionals has been incredible. They have continued to go above and beyond to protect our residents and loved ones from the virus. I am extremely appreciative for their continued dedication to keeping our communities safe.  As well, Mr. Speaker, the response of our whole community has been overwhelming. Everyone worked together to support one another, and those self-isolating or tested positive. This community always comes together when times are challenging, and this has been no different.  Because this outbreak impacted our youngest residents, the GNWT worked diligently to secure doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to begin administering to those aged 12 to 17. Our youth were some of the first in the country to get the vaccine, Mr. Speaker, a true testament of our efforts to protect as many residents as we can from COVID-19. Since the first case was confirmed, a tremendous amount of work has gone on behind the scenes to understand the extent of the spread, and to contain it as quickly as possible. Because of this hard work, not only by our Chief Public Health Officer and her team, but by our incredible residents and businesses as well, we were able to prevent community transmission in Yellowknife and surrounding areas.  However, it is important to put things into perspective. While we are encouraged to see residents getting vaccinated at a higher rate than most jurisdictions in Canada, we still have work to do, especially in some of our smaller communities.  Mr. Speaker, getting vaccinated is the right thing to do. It protects yourself, your family, your neighbours, and those most vulnerable including our children, and the important knowledge keepers in communities, our Elders.  If we all do our part, we can begin to get back to the things we love, like community feasts, hand games tournaments, and travelling.  Every person who gets vaccinated plays an important part in our effort to beat COVID-19, in our combined efforts to protect the health and well-being of our communities and loved ones. Please, get vaccinated. The Government of Canada has talked about a one-dose summer, where 75% of residents across Canada getting their first dose means things may start to return to normal. We all want that, Mr. Speaker, so let us keep doing our part. Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories is ready to turn its attention to the economic and social recovery of our great territory. The pandemic has brought into sharper focus the urgent need to act on social and economic development.  Like every other jurisdiction, residents and businesses were asked to make great sacrifices to help protect the NWT from COVID-19. While we have largely escaped the worst of the health impacts, residents did suffer economic, financial and social losses and the GNWT is committed to helping the territory recover and come back stronger than before. The majority of our economic and social challenges are not new though.  Many of the effects of the pandemic were a result of social and economic gaps and challenges that existed before the pandemic and which the GNWT, businesses and communities were already working to address. Continuing that work  and accelerating it where it makes sense,  is going to be a key part of how the GNWT helps promote recovery. Mr. Speaker, we are committed to working on the social and economic recovery of the Northwest Territories so we can emerge stronger, and we have been engaging with multiple sectors on a plan. We will be tabling this plan later in this sitting and will continue the discussion about how we will work together as a territory to promote recovery over the coming months and years.   Mr. Speaker, the partnerships we have forged during this pandemic has shown us the importance of collaboration, and community, in a time of crisis. Our success depends on partnership with all levels of government and working closely with all stakeholders. The support of Indigenous and municipal governments, residents and businesses has kept the people of the NWT largely safe from the waves of the virus that continues to affect other parts of the country and the world.  Mr. Speaker, we are fortunate to have not experienced the same level of health impacts we see elsewhere. With the guidance of the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer, we have been able to keep many businesses open, while still protecting NWT residents. At the same time, we know that some areas of our economy have been particularly hard hit, and that many residents have been suffering.  As we have responded to the pandemic, residents, communities, and businesses have been very open in identifying the impacts and actions most needed to position ourselves to seize the opportunities that the post pandemic expansion will offer. By working closely with stakeholders to implement our mandate and the Emerging Stronger plan, we have the opportunity to set the NWT up to be in a position to thrive.  This includes continuing to build on our strong relationship with the federal government. Mr. Speaker, Canada understands the impact the pandemic has had on the North. Covid-19 has laid bare the gaps in our society, and the federal budget released in April addresses several shared priorities and reflects that they are listening to what our needs are.  Investments in housing, child care, climate change, the green economy, and job creation are examples of their commitment to closing those gaps and ensuring a prosperous Northwest Territories for generations to come. Canada’s commitment to ensuring people are not left behind as we move forward aligns with our efforts to create a better future for our territory and its residents. Mr. Speaker, Canada is investing in areas that are important to our future and will benefit our efforts to meet the commitments outlined in our mandate. Mr. Speaker, in the federal budget, we were heard. Our government had identified a number of areas for potential funding including infrastructure, housing, connectivity, health, postsecondary education, climate change, and early childhood education. Working closely with Canada and continuing to strengthen an already positive relationship will help support our goal of social and economic recovery.  Mr. Speaker, I am optimistic that we share common goals between our governments, and I look forward to learning more about how we will benefit from the commitments made by Canada in the coming months.  We have faced one of the most difficult challenges our society has faced in the last century. It has not been easy. But I am confident that in the coming months, by working together, that we will begin to emerge from the pandemic and return to the things we love.   Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Government of the Northwest Territories has been committed to protecting the health and well-being of residents, and to this point, we have been successful. Mr. Speaker, we are also committed to ensuring a social and economic recovery that will make the Northwest Territories stronger and support the success of residents now and into the future.  If we have learned anything in this pandemic, it is the importance of strong and collaborative relationships built on mutual respect, trust, and understanding.  We have learnt the sense of community.  Mr. Speaker, as we go forward, we will continue to work with Indigenous leaders, community governments, the federal government, stakeholder groups, the business community, and residents, to ensure a holistic approach to our collective efforts to emerge from this pandemic a stronger Northwest Territories.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

52,2021-05-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/gnwt-announces-changes-metis-health-benefits-policy,Government Website,GNWT Announces Changes to Métis Health Benefits Policy,"The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) announced today that it has made changes to  the eligibility criteria for Métis Health Benefits  to reduce barriers to access supplementary health insurance. The Métis Health Benefits Policy first came into effect in 1995 and had not seen any substantial changes since then. The GNWT had heard concerns about the administrative practice for determining the ‘payor of last resort’ eligibility criteria..  Now applicants will no longer need to provide proof that they are not eligible for coverage under the federal Non-Insured Health Benefits Program. Instead, the amended Eligibility Criteria asks that the applicant self-identify as Métis and be a member of an Indigenous government or Indigenous organization in the NWT whose members hold or assert to hold Aboriginal rights in the NWT as affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.  This change is a more respectful way of determining eligibility criteria for the Métis Health Benefits Policy and aligns with principles of self-determination identified in the United Nations Declaration. Quote(s) “The Métis Health Benefits Policy had not been updated in over twenty-five years and is no longer aligned with current needs and realities. The updated policy ensures Métis can continue to access non-insured health benefits through appropriate programs.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick facts The Northwest Territories is the only jurisdiction that provides supplementary health insurance benefits specifically for Métis. The policy allows for the GNWT to sponsor the Métis Health Benefits program to provide eligible Indigenous Métis residents of the Northwest Territories access to a range of benefits not covered by hospital and medical care insurance. The updated Métis Health Benefits Policy is still the payor of last resort, meaning that if other insurance plans are available, those plans must be used first. The Policy still requires that the applicant is not registered under the Indian Act or an Inuk recognized by an Inuit Land Claim organization but no longer require applicants to first be denied NIHB as proof. Benefits under the Métis Health Benefits program align with the Government of Canada’s Non-Insured Health Benefits Program (NIHB). The GNWT engaged Indigenous Governments and Indigenous Organizations that have members who may identify as Métis for feedback in making changes to the Métis Health Benefits Policy.

In the summer of 2020, the GNWT implemented a border station and pass system at the NWT-Alberta border in the Fort Smith area to maintain protections for COVID-19 in the NWT, while respecting deep ties between communities on either side. The border station in this area is busy, typically averaging over 300 crossings by vehicles per week. This border station serves as a gateway into Wood Buffalo National Park and includes popular camping destinations like the Pine Lake area and the park’s Salt River trail network, which are located on the Alberta side of the NWT-Alberta border in the Fort Smith area. For out-of-territory travellers travelling through the NWT to reach the Alberta portion of Wood Buffalo National Park, there are processes in place to ensure minimal-to-no-contact with NWT residents and communities. Important processes include: When entering the NWT at the Highway 1 border station (60th Parallel), out-of-territory travellers, must go directly to the Highway 5 border station in Fort Smith and proceed to their camp site in Wood Buffalo National Park. They must only stop in NWT communities for essential reasons such as getting gas, using a washroom or a medical emergency. Out-of-territory travellers must present themselves at the Highway 5 border station in Fort Smith and obtain the appropriate pass to continue to Wood Buffalo National Park. While camping in the Alberta portion of Wood Buffalo National Park, it is recommended that out-of-territory travellers follow public health guidelines set out by the NWT’s Chief Public Health Officer. These guidelines include staying in their own accommodations, not visiting and mingling with other park guests, remaining at least two metres from others and using a clean-trip kit, including sanitizer and masks when visiting busier areas of the park. Upon leaving the park, out-of-territory travellers must present themselves at the Highway 5 border station in Fort Smith, return their pass, go directly to the Highway 1 border station (60th Parallel), and not stop in NWT communities for non-essential reasons as they leave the territory.  NWT residents are also reminded that they can continue to travel in and out of the NWT at the Highway 5 border station in Fort Smith without having to submit a Self-Isolation Plan or self-isolate upon entry to the NWT, in accordance with the Fort Smith Border Protocol. They should also follow the public health guidance set out by the NWT’s Chief Public Health Officer when they are visiting or camping in the park.

59,2021-05-19,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/progress-update-child-and-family-services-systems-quality-improvement-plan-1,Government Website,Progress Update on the Child and Family Services System’s Quality Improvement Plan,"Child and Family Services  (CFS) is continuing to make steady progress in transforming the Child and Family Services system to better meet the needs of children and youth. This commitment to change is in keeping with the recommendations of the Auditor General of Canada and aligned with the new Federal legislation on child and family services. Enabling families to care for children and youth in their community is a priority. To date, 39 action items in the Quality Improvement Plan have been completed, 30 are on track and 1 is on hold.  Of the 30 action items that are on track, 24 (80%) of these items are ongoing initiatives. While the core of the work has been completed, these initiatives are continuous and will be embedded in future CFS quality improvement and assurance processes. Some examples of positive system improvements since December 2020 include: In March 2021 training began for Family Preservation Workers in each region, further strengthening prevention services for children, youth and families. Prevention Services are now available to expectant parent(s).  Offering services in the prenatal period mitigates the risk of family separation and may reduce the likelihood of future child protection involvement. Families and relatives are given priority in the selection of care providers – this leads to fewer children and youth having to live away from their home community and their extended family. As part of a three year funding initiative from 2019-2021, there will be  additional investments from April 1, 2021 for 16 additional positions in the Child and Family Services system. These positions will fill staffing need in the area of family preservation, foster care and supervisory support. Delivered  mandatory refresher training for all staff based on the key audit findings. Trainers covered twelve training topics between October and December 2020. The Department of Health and Social Services developed two new overarching Child and Family Services practice standards related to the Federal Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families to guide service delivery and ensure services are provided in a culturally-informed manner. Training on the Federal Act was completed in April 2021. As of April 2021, the Department and Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority has met with four Indigenous governments to discuss the Federal Act and the impact of implementation on the delivery of child and family services to their community members, as well as strengthening partnerships in the best interest of children. The Quality Improvement Plan Progress Tracker reflects the latest updates. Visit: Quality Improvement Plan (Child and Family Services) Quote “As we continue to transform the Child and Family Services System, the Quality Improvement Plan’s flexibility helps make sure that we are on the right path, adjusting approaches when needed, and considering all options for success. This work has enabled CFS staff to evolve their practice to align with the Federal Act Respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families and ensure they focus on promoting connectedness to family, community and culture. The additional investments in 16 new positions will help meet this commitment.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick facts The Quality Improvement Plan acts on issues identified through internal audits, the 2018 Auditor General Report, Standing Committee on Government Operations and feedback from staff, Indigenous Governments, Foster Family Coalition of the NWT, and other stakeholders. The Quality Improvement Plan is a living document. The Department continuously assesses the system’s capacity to produce key deliverables, which allows for the ability to be flexible and to modify timelines. The Plan identifies four underlying strategic directions to improve the system and address priorities: 		Culture of Quality: Embedding quality practice into our culture Human Resource Planning: Making sure the right people are in the right places Building Staff Capacity: Investing in our staff Engagement: Drawing on the knowledge and experience of others.

The new NWT Parks logo combines unique elements found in the NWT, including the boreal forest and its waters, the midnight sun, the aurora, and the vibrant colours across the north. With this new brand, ITI and NWT Parks will now have greater ability to run marketing initiatives focused on various aspects of regional NWT Parks to local, national, and international audiences ultimately, once the NWT border restrictions are eased.  The launch video features a number of locations across the NWT, highlighting some of the beautiful landscapes and unique natural wonders both in and on the way to our parks. NWTParks.ca has also received an upgrade. Booking is much more intuitive, with the ability to filter for your recommended RV, trailer, or tent as well as easy map viewing for availability. All park amenities are now displayed beside the park map. NWT Parks and Tourism are a part of ITI’s mandate to increase economic diversification by supporting growth in non-extractive sectors and setting regional diversification targets.  Quote ""Over the past number of years, there has been a consistent – and growing -stream of visitors to the Northwest Territories, in part due to the excellent marketing efforts of Northwest Territories Tourism. While we have experienced an expected downturn in out-of-territory visitors over the past year, NWT Parks have become increasingly popular destinations for NWT residents, with local usage growing nearly 50 percent during that period. When we are ready to accept visitors again, marketing our parks and ready-to-explore areas under this new logo offers us the opportunity to demonstrate we are ready to welcome the world and grow this key sector.” - Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment Quick facts There are 35 heritage, natural environment, day-use/wayside, and recreational sites across the NWT.  NWT campgrounds generally open mid-May and close mid to end of September, which varies from park to park.   All footage was filmed in NWT Parks and natural areas within the Northwest Territories. In 2020-2021, out of territory parks visitor numbers diminished, while usage from NWT residents increased by nearly 50%. The new NWT Parks logo was developed based on extensive research and review of similar approaches across Canada, and will provide the ability to market parks and ready-to-explore areas with a dedicated and consistent look and feel to audiences near and far.

In order to assist those in the communities affected by the flooding the GNWT will match donations to the United Way NWT which will then be dispersed to various organizations that are able to provide the necessary aid to residents.   Senior regional officials with the GNWT have been working closely with community governments to support them as they lead the response to the flooding. Regional Emergency Management Organizations, under the leadership of Municipal and Community Affairs, remain in contact with affected and at-risk communities. The Territorial EMO continues to receive reports from all regions and the GNWT remains prepared to provide additional support and assistance to local authorities currently managing emergency response.      The United Way is an organization that receives donations from various sources and is then able to distribute funding to other organizations involved in responding to these events. This allows the GNWT to provide additional assistance to the communities in need, beyond the current resources that are already being directly deployed towards the disaster relief.     Quotes “The overwhelming response from across the Northwest Territories to support those displaced by the flooding is a true example of how we come together to help those in need. Our government is committed to supporting efforts to keep residents safe, and when the time comes to begin the recovery efforts, we will be right there to help residents and communities.”   - Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories   “The Northwest Territories is one large, tight-knit community.  Over the past week we’ve seen our community members step up and answer the call to help those in need as a result of the recent flooding. In hopes of encouraging Northerners to keep up this generosity, and to offer additional financial support as a government, the GNWT will match residents’ donations to help these communities stay safe, heal and recover.”  - Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance   “Northerners are truly amazing in their ability to come together and support each other no matter the challenges faced. The outpour of support that has been shown, is an incredible thing to witness. We are committed to supporting communities in every way we can as they address impacts to their communities. We see you, and you are resilient and strong. We will get through this together.” - Paulie Chinna, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs   “Our region is hurting right now.

Education board trustees will communicate their decisions to their Superintendents who will in turn inform school staff, parents, and students of the detailed plans.   Minister Simpson and the Board chairs were encouraged by the incredible uptake of the PfizerNBiotech COVID-19 vaccine among 12-17 year old residents. The vaccine was rolled-out last week in Yellowknife and Behchokǫ̀ – locations prioritized due to the outbreak at N.J. Macpherson School in Yellowknife. Minister Simpson noted that there was no spread of COVID-19 to educational staff at N.J. Macpherson, pointing to the school’s diligent safety protocols already in place.   The Minister and the board chairs discussed the OCPHO’s new safety measures. The Minister assured education leaders that ECE and the OCPHO will continue to work with and support schools over the coming days and weeks to ensure a smooth transition back to in-person schooling. The Minister recognized the tremendous amount of work that goes into these transitions and he thanked education leaders for their cooperation and coordination during these challenging times.    Renalyn Pascua-Matte, Chairperson of the Dehcho Divisional Education Council, also provided an update on the significant impact of flooding on the communities of Jean Marie River and Fort Simpson, where the schools are currently closed.  The Minister expressed that the immediate concern is the safety of community residents. He commented on residents’ resilience and said ECE staff will support the Divisional Education Council, schools and students in the coming weeks in any way they can.     Quotes:   “It has been a difficult year. My heart goes out to the communities in the Dehcho, particularly Jean Marie River and Fort Simpson, as they grapple with devastating flooding. ECE staff are ready to offer support. My office is working closely with the Divisional Education Council and the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs to ensure we’re doing everything we can.   “The successful pivot between in-person and distance learning over the past two weeks has demonstrated the true resolve of NWT education leaders, teachers, students and families in these trying times. I appreciate the enormous effort this required and thank everyone for their continued dedication to our students. I am also impressed by the many students who received their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and I thank them for setting an example for the rest of the territory.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment      “I am pleased that students will be able to return to in-school learning in the coming days and weeks.

The Department of Municipal and Community affairs (MACA) Emergency Management Organization (EMO) continues to work collaboratively with impacted communities to provide on the ground support. The Department of Infrastructure (INF) and Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC) continue to coordinate with the Territorial Emergency Organization, assess and evaluate buildings for electrical safety, offer alternative power solutions where they can and more. Once it is safe to do so, the GNWT will begin the process of assessing the damage to the residential areas as well as community infrastructure. Priority is on supporting impacted communities as they rebuild and recover. At this time, the GNWT has sent aircrafts to support evacuations as well as supplies requested by Community Emergency organizations.  As the flooding situation evolves, the GNWT is also looking at options for how to manage donations that residents and organizations are looking to make. More information will be provided once details have been confirmed. The Department of Infrastructure has dispatched teams to the region to begin clearing ice on the shore in preparation to launch ferry service into Fort Simpson in the coming days. The ferry will only become operational once the water levels drop to a safe level for the ferry to go into the water. The GNWT is also assessing the need for financial assistance for further support as we assess community damage. This includes initial discussions with the Federal Government about how they can support the overall recovery efforts. Quotes “The North has always been a place where residents come together during a time of need and I know we all will for those impacted by the flooding. We are going to do everything we can to ensure that you are safe and have the supports you need. Once flooding has subsided, the GNWT will continue to work with Indigenous leadership and community governments who will be focused on leading the recovery.” - Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories   “When NWT residents and communities are at risk, it is important that our territory comes together to provide support the best we can. The Department of Infrastructure and Northwest Territories Power Corporation continue to monitor the situation and provide support where it is safe to do so. The GNWT will continue to do what we can to support communities and residents during this difficult time and as they transition to recovery – work with communities to make the transition as efficient as we can. - Diane Archie, Deputy Premier, Minister of Infrastructure and Minister Responsible for the Northwest Territories Power Corporation   “Northerners have always shown a unique ability to come together and support one another during times of need, we continue to see this sense of community across the NWT. I want to commend the collaboration and partnership between community leaders for working effectively and efficiently to address the needs of their communities. We will continue to do everything we can to support communities and residents during this trying time.”   -Paulie Chinna, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs   ""The outpouring of support from across the NWT has been incredible. I recognize that many people want to know what they can do and how they can help.  It is important that we let the professionals on the ground do their jobs and that we support them however we can while we navigate the flooding situation.” -Shane Thompson, MLA for Nahendeh Quick facts The majority of emergencies are dealt with at the local level. Local Authorities are required to have emergency plans in place and enact them when an emergency event impacts the community. Direction and control of response operations is conducted by local officials. The regional EMO will be notified and provided situational awareness to monitor the situation for possible GNWT involvement. Should the Local Authority request assistance to deal with an emergency, or become overwhelmed by the nature of the incident, GNWT support is provided. While community response operations will remain under the direction and control of the Local Authority, GNWT support is directed and controlled by the regional EMO as a designated incident manager. In circumstances where the Local Authority is overwhelmed, the community is not established as a municipal corporation or the emergency extends beyond the boundaries of a community, the regional EMO may take some or all responsibility for direction and control of emergency response operations. Emergency response priorities help guide decision making on response activities. The following emergency response priorities are used within the NWT. The response priorities are listed in order of priority and should be use when developing operational plans and for general decision making within the EOCs. Priorities in conducting emergency response operations are: 1. Provide for the safety and health of all responders 2. Save lives 3. Reduce suffering 4. Protect public health 5. Protect critical infrastructure 6. Protect property 7. Protect the environment 8. Reduce economic and social losses. The GNWT may provide financial assistance to community governments, small businesses, and residents of the NWT who have suffered damage as a result of a disaster. The GNWT’s Disaster Assistance Policy (DAP) may provide financial support to assist individuals, small businesses and community governments in recovering from a disaster and restoring damaged property to its pre-disaster condition. The DAP is similar to disaster assistance programs established in other jurisdictions in Canada and is closely aligned with the federal Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA). DFAA provides financial assistance to provinces and territories to help them cover costs relating to a disaster.

Quotes “The response to the NJ Macpherson outbreak is an example of how safety and preparedness have been our top priorities since the pandemic began, and the response to contain this outbreak is an example of the hard work of so many to protect residents and communities. We wouldn’t be in the position we are with this outbreak if it wasn’t for the collective effort of our community.

Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE), met with territorial education leaders Monday, May 3 to discuss recent school closures in Yellowknife, Ndilo, Dettah and Behchokǫ̀, as a proactive measure to limit a COVID-19 outbreak at N.J. Macpherson School in Yellowknife. During the virtual meeting, Minister Simpson reiterated the findings of the NWT Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO), confirming multiple positive cases of COVID-19 linked to a Yellowknife school. OCPHO staff attended the meeting to provide an update and answer questions from education leaders. OCPHO staff reported that they are still investigating chains of transmission that led to the outbreak in the hope of being able to identify anyone who may have been exposed. ECE staff are supporting schools with guidance and resources to pivot to at-home learning, which is expected to start on Wednesday, May 5 in Yellowknife, Ndilo and Dettah, and Thursday, May 6 in Behchokǫ̀. This includes the continued availability of mental health counselling services for all students and their families. Education bodies are also committed to continuing to provide food programs to their students while schools are closed. Minister Simpson committed to ensuring education leaders have the latest information from the OCPHO around school closures as soon as it’s available and to continue meeting with education leaders over the coming weeks. Both the Minister and education leaders recognized the hard work of education staff and superintendents and the strong coordination between all school boards during this evolving situation, and acknowledged the complex operational challenges the sudden closures pose to NWT schools. Quotes: “I would like to thank education leaders for their patience, understanding and hard work during this rapidly evolving situation. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the territory’s education leaders, educators, students, families and communities have shown resilience, and this week is no exception. We are committed to ensuring that they are supported during this challenging time, and that we keep communication lines open. As always, the safety of our communities is of the utmost importance.

80,2021-05-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/northwest-territories-expands-covid-19-vaccine-program,Government Website,Northwest Territories Expands COVID-19 Vaccine Program,"The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is announcing the expansion of its COVID-19 vaccine program to include the Pfizer-BioNTech product, which is approved for individuals 12 years of age and older. To date, the NWT’s program has been solely based on the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, which is approved for those 18 years of age and older. After successful negotiations with the National Operation Centre (NOC) and provinces, the GNWT is exchanging future shipments of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for Pfizer-BioNTech to protect as many residents as possible from the virus.  Just over 1,100 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech arrived safely in the NWT yesterday, May 4. Additional shipments are expected in the coming weeks. Due to limited supply, doses of Pfizer-BioNTech will not be offered to adults 18 years of age and older at this time; but this age group can still access the Moderna vaccine. Introducing a second product into the NWT’s inventory will allow for a more flexible, sustainable, and reliable COVID-19 vaccine program. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine wass approved today by Health Canada for those 12 years of age and older, allowing for greater vaccine coverage. The GNWT decided on this proactive measure to expand vaccine eligibility in part because of the increased prevalence of more contagious and deadly variants of concern, which pose a threat to the unvaccinated population and health system capacity. Due to recent clusters of COVID-19 cases in Yellowknife involving young people, Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be offered first to youth aged 12-17 in Yellowknife between May 6 and 8, 2021. Appointments can be booked on a first-come, first-served basis via the NTHSSA website, and additional opportunities will be added once resources and supply allow. Youth from other NWT communities who happen to be in Yellowknife during this time are allowed to book appointments to be vaccinated. Doses will be held back for youth aged 12-17 in Behchokǫ̀ and offered next week. Those 18 years of age and older in all NWT communities are still able access the Moderna vaccine by contacting the local public health unit or health centre. Additional Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is expected in the coming weeks, which will be delivered to youth aged 12-17 in all other NWT communities. Details for upcoming clinics will be posted to www.nthssa.ca/covid-vaccine, shared via GNWT and NTHSSA social media pages, and communicated broadly once finalized. Additionally, protocols and procedures have been updated and streamlined to facilitate more regular vaccine availability to asymptomatic individuals in isolation. Giving vaccine to someone during their isolation period requires additional personal protective equipment and coordination to ensure the safety of staff, clients, and others at the clinic. Starting today, asymptomatic people will be permitted to get vaccinated during their isolation period after e-mailing CPHO@gov.nt.ca to seek prior written approval. The GNWT remains committed to reducing barriers to ensure all eligible residents have safe and equitable access to vaccine. Quotes “On behalf of all residents of the NWT, I would like to thank our vaccine team for facilitating this important expansion of our vaccine program.  This approach will give increased protection to  youth,  schools, and  communities at a time when we need it most. -Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services   “Protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of our students, school staff and communities has been our top priority since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Partnerships for the exchange of vaccine positions us to offer further protection when we need it most. -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education Culture and Employment   Quick facts Expanding the NWT’s COVID-19 vaccine program to include Pfizer-BioNTech is beneficial for a few reasons: 		Youth aged 12 years and older are eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which will offer increased protection to our schools and communities. Moderna’s potential approval for this age group is still months away. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine comes in vials of six doses compared to Moderna vials of 10 doses. A lower number of doses per vial gives health authorities a lower threshold for sending vaccine into a community and reduces the likelihood of wastage. Doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be given three weeks apart, instead of the minimum of four weeks required with Moderna. Less time between doses allows faster movement towards full vaccination and the potential for some students having both doses before summer break begins.    The cold chain requirements for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have been updated to bring it closer to what we have been trained for to handle with the Moderna vaccine. The NWT is well positioned to offer this vaccine now due to stronger infrastructure and staffing capacity.  The NWT has requested a total of 18,800 doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the second quarter of 2021 to protect additional residents and to continue vaccinating non-resident rotational workers at high risk of bringing the virus into the NWT.  The NWT will not be exchanging all of its Moderna vaccine allotment for Pfizer-BioNTech. Enough doses will be kept to give second doses of Moderna to anyone with a first dose, and to provide flexibility within the NWT’s vaccine program.

Thank you for being here today. With me I have Health and Social Services Minister Julie Green, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola, and Territorial Medical Director Dr. AnneMarie Pegg. The last few days have been what we have been preparing for as a territory since the beginning of the pandemic. As we have watched the third wave of COVID-19 challenge our neighbours to the south, and sadly, in recent weeks, our Northern neighbours in Yukon and Nunavut, it was inevitable that we would see our cases rise. The situation in Yellowknife is fluid, and we don’t have all the answers yet. When we have new information to share, we are committed to keeping residents informed. Our health care professionals at the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer and the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority, as well as staff in the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat have been working day and night to contain the virus. Since the beginning of the pandemic, safety and preparedness have been our top priorities, and continues to be today as we deal with our second outbreak in a community. We have spent the last 14 months understanding the best practices for dealing with an outbreak. We have strong processes in place for managing this situation – especially in our school system where fulsome procedures have been implemented to protect our students, teachers, and anyone in the education system. The decision of the Chief Public Health Officer to close all schools in Yellowknife was out of an abundance of caution. It was a decision meant to ensure that the spread was contained and to not take any unnecessary risks that further jeopardize the health of our residents. COVID-19 is spread by extended contact with infectious individuals and Public Health is following up with known contacts of the people who have tested positive. If Public Health has not actively reached out to you, you have not been identified as a contact of a case of COVID-19. Where the OCPHO is not able to identify all contacts, it is providing public exposure notifications so people can identify themselves as possibly being exposed. This list will be updated if further exposures are identified. Please be aware that if Public Health has not been in contact to ask that you be tested, and you do not have symptoms, there is no reason to be tested at this time. If you have been contacted by Public Health or have symptoms, please get tested. It’s important we allow Public Health to do their jobs and focus on the areas of concern at this time. There is going to be a lot of speculation and rumours over the next few days. It’s important you get your information from reputable sources. Rumours and incorrect information only make it more difficult for health officials to respond to this situation. For the most up-to-date information, please visit the GNWT’s COVID-19 response website. I know this is a difficult and uncertain time. But it’s important we all remain calm and committed to following the Public Health Orders and recommendations. We need to help support our community members who are now isolating, so if you know someone please reach out and check in on them. Northerners are known for their sense of community, so let’s make sure we show that in the coming days and weeks. As I’ve said many times before, if you haven’t been vaccinated yet, please book your appointment. We all need to do our part to protect our communities, and this is one of the best ways for each of us to contribute to that effort. I’d now like to turn it over to Minister Green. Thank you."

I would like to start off this morning by recognizing that the past couple of weeks have been difficult ones for NWT residents, particularly for Yellowknifers. Just as we were preparing to relax some of the public health measures, we had an increase in cases including the first confirmed cases of the COVID-19 UK variant. As a result, some Yellowknifers are concerned and anxious. That’s  understandable. If that’s you, please hear me when I say  anxiety in our current situation is natural. There is, however, no need to be scared. Our government and the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer are ready to react to an increase of cases. We are prepared for it and we know what we have to do to ensure that our friends, family and communities remain safe. You are in good hands with my staff and we will get through this together. The best thing to do right now is to stick to the public health measures we know work to stop COVID-19 transmission and follow the guidance to bring the situation under control. Never has wearing a mask in public been so important or to follow isolation protocols. The other thing within our control is to get vaccinated. We continue to see a lull in our vaccine uptake and I want to take this opportunity to urge anyone who has not yet received the vaccine, or anyone due for their second dose, to contact their local health provider or health centre to find out how to access it. The GNWT is close to finalizing an exchange of vaccine with other provinces to acquire the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is currently approved for those 16 years of age and older, and is expected to expand to those aged 12-15 in the near future, allowing for greater vaccine coverage. Introducing a second product into the NWT’s inventory will allow for more a more flexible, sustainable, and reliable COVID-19 vaccine program. Once the exchange is finalized, the details will be formally announced and information will be posted to the NTHSSA social media and website. We need everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated, so we can get back to doing the things we love in our communities. Over the next few days, the situation in Yellowknife will continue to unfold in rapid and unpredictable ways. You will continue to have questions and we are committed to ensuring you get the information you need as quickly as possible. I also want to emphasize that in spite of the cases announced over the weekend, there isn’t necessarily a risk to you going about your daily business. Unless Public Health staff have reached out to you directly or has released a public exposure notice about a place you have been, there is no reason to jump to the conclusion you are at risk. Public Health staff are doing the risk-analysis work and are contacting people who may be affected as soon as possible, as well as providing information on what you should be doing to stay safe. I want to thank Yellowknifers for staying calm through this uncertain time and following the guidance of the Chief Public Health Officer. Dr Kandola has had to make some tough decisions over the past few days, decisions I know will keep us safe. I support those decisions. A lot is being asked of all of us now, but I am confident that together we will get through this and we will be stronger for it. Continue to keep gatherings small and spaces large, practice physical distancing, wear your mask, stay home, get tested if you are feeling sick, and get vaccinated to protect yourself and others against COVID-19. I would now like to invite Dr. Kandola to provide some detailed remarks about the Public Health Advisories that have been released over the past few days. Thank you.  "
85,2021-05-03,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/dr-kami-kandola-covid-19-update,Government Website,Dr. Kami Kandola: COVID 19 Update,"Check against delivery   Good morning everyone. NWT residents – you have done a remarkable job being resilient and helping fight COVID-19 the past 13 months. Now we’ve hit a challenging period in our pandemic response. Over the past three days we have announced eight confirmed COVID-19 infections at N.J. Macpherson School and declared an outbreak at this school. Local public health staff are currently working on identifying all contacts to these cases as well as the additional 11 probable cases. This outbreak comes on the heels of a Yellowknife cluster of five COVID-19 infections picked up by wastewater testing surveillance announced on April 19, 2021. I am thankful that all four of the five cases related to the Yellowknife cluster have now fully recovered. However, with respect to this new outbreak at N.J. Macpherson School, we need to take strong actions. Those actions include closing all schools in Yellowknife, Dettah and Ndilo to in-class learning until further notice. There have been many contacts and exposures involving multiple Yellowknife-based schools. Students will shift to remote learning while schools are closed. All extracurricular, club and sports activities for kids under the age of 18 are also suspended for the time being. I have also issued a public health order that wearing a non-medical mask in all indoor public spaces is mandatory – except when you are eating or drinking. We are also recommending non-essential travel in and out of Yellowknife be cancelled or deferred at this time. However, if you have necessary medical appointments in Yellowknife, we ask that you attend those. Do not cancel or defer them – if possible. Afterschool care programs are suspended until further notice. All daycare and day homes are able to stay open, unless impacted by school closures or those that have received public health direction to close. The OCPHO considers them an essential service at this time. The public will have to check with individual day homes to find out if they are open or not. As, stated, the OCPHO has not mandated the closure of day homes and daycares other than those impacted by the School Closure and outbreak declaration. We are also strongly encouraging employees to work remotely if they can. I know these measures will impact many people in Yellowknife and in our territory. It impacts our children’s education, parent’s work schedules and child care opportunities, social activities, employers running businesses and more. These are not easy decisions. Nobody wants to close schools to in-class learning or suspend extracurricular activities for our kids. But they are necessary right now. With the growing number of cases and contacts, we need to do all we can to stop transmission in the highest risk areas. It was imperative that we put into place strong measures quickly and notify the public of the growing list of public exposure risks. I also want to clarify direction for household members of student and staff at N.J. Macpherson School. As a result of the evolving situation, all students, staff and volunteers attending during the week of of April 26-30 are now considered close contacts. This means that all household members must isolate too. Only if you are an essential worker and are fully vaccinated, meaning two weeks after your second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, may you seek permission to go to work. You must review your circumstances with your employer and then apply to ProtectNWT for permission to go to work. If granted, you will be required to isolate outside of work. And, this only applies while you don’t have symptoms and neither does anyone else in your household. This is a shift from earlier guidance that all fully-vaccinated household members can go to work. If there are essential workers that are not fully vaccinated or have specific circumstances, they should they should contact Protect NWT to have their situation reviewed. Children under the age of 18 are an unvaccinated portion of our population and we must protect them. We are confident these temporary measures will do that. And we are confident they will be effective in protecting the rest of Yellowknife as well. This is also a good time to stress that fighting COVID-19 is a collective effort and we need to be extra vigilant at this time in doing the things we know work to stop the spread of this virus. Those things are: Keeping physical distance of at least six feet or two metres. Wearing masks when you’re out. Keeping crowds small, and spaces large. Washing your hands frequently. Staying home if you’re feeling even a little sick. Calling your healthcare provider or local health centre to be assessed if you have any COVID-19 symptoms. Limiting indoor household gatherings to no more than five regular visitors to a maximum of 10 people in the household at any given time. Keep gatherings small. And self-isolating responsibly whenever required. Let’s not forget to get vaccinated. Vaccines will help us defeat COVID-19 and get back to doing the things that we love. The vaccine is here and it’s safe, effective, and available. Make an appointment if you haven’t already. If you have received your first dose, make sure you book an appointment for your second dose. You are not fully vaccinated until two weeks after your second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. As we continue to respond to this pandemic, I want to thank everyone who continue to come forward to get tested for COVID-19 and provide information to public health staff when new cases are identified. By doing this you are helping keep your family, friends and communities safe. We can’t fight – and defeat – COVID-19 without our residents doing these things.   I also want to thank our health care staff for working with our residents to help them navigate this difficult time. It’s not an easy job. But in a pandemic it’s a vitally important one. I want you to know your efforts have not gone unnoticed. This isn’t the first challenge our territory has faced during the pandemic. It likely won’t be the last. But we have overcome those challenges in the past. And we’ll overcome this one, too. Let’s continue to stick together. Let’s continue to be kind to one another and help one another. Let’s get vaccinated – if you haven’t already. Let’s follow the public health measures – both the ones we’ve just announced and the others that have been in place for some time. By doing these things we’ll get through this. Together we can defeat COVID-19."

Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment issued the following joint statement today on the most recent updates concerning COVID-19 in Yellowknife: “We know this is a difficult situation Yellowknifers are facing. We have spent the last 14 months working diligently and collectively so we would be prepared to manage COVID-19 cases, protect our residents and communities from the virus, and ensure we maintain the integrity of our health care system in the process. We are ready for this challenge.  “We have spent this time preparing for just this kind of situation and understand what needs to be done to prevent any further spread of the virus. When an outbreak in the community of Fort Liard happened earlier this year, we responded with an immense effort to limit the spread. And we were successful. We all worked together – community leaders, residents, government, health care professionals – to make sure the impact was limited.  “We have done it before, and we can do it again. The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) and the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority (NTHSSA), along with government officials from multiple departments, are working together to ensure the correct information gets shared with school parents, residents, and those who may be impacted by the confirmed cases through possible exposure and contact tracing.  “The situation in Yellowknife is unfolding quickly and we do not yet have all the answers. We know this is difficult to hear, but we want to assure you that a tremendous amount of work is going on behind the scenes and as soon as more information is known, Public Health will update NWT residents. We all want to protect our communities and our loved ones, but it’s important that we all remain calm and let our health care professionals do the work that will help keep us protected. We are committed to providing information to residents as soon as we possibly can.  “To the N.J MacPherson School community: the CPHO is asking all staff, students and their families to isolate for 14 days so she can be certain the outbreak has been contained.  This does not mean that those in self-isolation will contract the virus, but this is one of the most effective ways to contain transmission should the virus spread within a household.    “Household members who are fully vaccinated (two weeks after your second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine) can safely carry on with normal activities, including going to work, while being mindful of taking care to physically distance and wear a mask. This applies as long as no one in the household is symptomatic or identified as a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID-19. “To students, parents and staff at other Yellowknife schools: we are taking precautions to make sure COVID-19 can’t spread through your schools, too, and have shifted to remote learning for the next two weeks. Nobody needs to be scared, but we all need to be careful and should be monitoring for potential symptoms of the virus. “To Yellowknife residents: COVID-19 is spread by extended contact with infectious individuals and Public Health is following up with known contacts of the people who have tested positive. If Public Health has not actively reached out to you, you have not been identified as a contact of a case of COVID-19. Where the OCPHO is not able to identify all contacts, it is providing public exposure notifications so people can call in. This list will be updated if further exposures are identified. “Please be aware that if Public Health has not been in contact to ask that you be tested, and you do not have symptoms, there is no reason to be tested at this time unless you develop symptoms. “There is going to be a lot of speculation and information in the public realm over the next few days. It’s important you get your information from reputable sources. Rumours and incorrect information only make it more difficult for health officials to respond to this situation. For the most up-to-date information, please visit the GNWT’s COVID-19 response website at https://www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19/.   “When the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in March 2020, we made the health and safety of our residents and communities the number one priority of the Government of the Northwest Territories. “That continues to be our main focus and we remain committed to limiting the spread of COVID-19 and increasing vaccination rates so we can eventually return to the things we love.  “It’s important that we all continue to do our part – especially when it comes to protecting our most vulnerable, and those who cannot get vaccinated yet, like our young people.  “Please wash your hands regularly, wear a mask, keep your distance, be kind, and if you haven’t already, get vaccinated as soon as possible. It is our best defence against COVID-19.  “Thank you.” "

The report provides a summary of feedback from the public and stakeholders. MACA conducted in-person and virtual sessions to receive feedback and input from residents as well as facilitating an online survey. Over fifty (50) individuals provided input either through in-person / online engagement sessions held March 28 - 30, 2021 or through the survey, which ran from March 22 - April 5, 2021. Most residents indicated that they actively participate in fire smarting and fire prevention around their properties.  One of the key recommendations was for the department to consider the establishment of a program supporting the purchase of fire safety equipment. Most residents were not in favour of additional fees or taxes to support fire services.

Simpson, met with education leaders from across the Northwest Territories (NWT) on Tuesday to review various initiatives to Improve Student Outcomes in the Junior Kindergarten (JK) to Grade 12 (JK-12) education system.  Education leaders meet with Minister Simpson multiple times a year to hold important discussions about the future of education in the territory. Minister Simpson opened today’s virtual meeting by thanking the leaders and staff of the Yellowknife Catholic School Board for their response to the news of a COVID-19 case connected to one of their schools. He acknowledged the important work done this year by education leaders, education body staff and the Department of Education, Culture and Employment to develop well defined processes and procedures for managing this scenario.  As key stakeholders in all matters of education change and renewal, education leaders participated in a discussion regarding the 2030 Early Learning and Child Care (ELCC) Strategy discussion paper. The Strategy focuses on improving the availability and affordability of early learning and child care throughout the territory. The 10-year Strategy will provide a broad description of the elements required to increase the availability of child care throughout the NWT. Education leaders also discussed JK-12 Curriculum Renewal. ECE provided updates on recent public engagement initiatives, and ECE’s research into Alberta’s recently-released K-6 draft curriculum. The Minister assured education leaders that their input will inform decisions around JK-12 Curriculum Renewal, and any new curriculum will be carefully reviewed to ensure it meets the needs and interests of NWT students and communities. Minister Simpson and education leaders had productive follow-up discussions about Education Act Modernization (EAM). The presentation explored areas of the NWT education system’s structure and governance, including overlapping Roles and Responsibilities and Funding the Current Education System. Information about forthcoming online regional events and further public engagement opportunities around Education Act Modernization was shared. ECE also presented education leaders and the Minister with results from the Early Development Instrument (EDI). Kindergarten teachers in the NWT have completed this questionnaire since 2012 to measure a child’s ability to meet age-appropriate developmental expectations. Annually collected EDI data provides information to guide decision-making, monitor trends and measure the impacts of changes to programs and services provided for children in the early years. ECE is gathering feedback on the EDI results, as it works to change the way it analyzes and reports on the data. The next meeting of education leaders with Minister Simpson is scheduled for Tuesday, May 25, 2021. Quick facts: The GNWT is working to modernize the Education Act in an effort to improve student outcomes to the same level as the rest of Canada, and to close the gap in student outcomes that exist between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, and between students in Yellowknife and smaller communities. To participate in the modernization of the NWT Education Act please click here: Have Your Say – Education Act Modernization. ECE regularly reviews its curriculum and resources to ensure they align with the NWT’s priorities and values for education. The NWT currently uses a mix of curriculum that is either adapted or adopted from other jurisdictions in Canada, or is created in the NWT for JK-12. Much of the NWT curriculum is Alberta’s, especially at the high school level, though ECE also draws on parts of its curriculum from other Western Canadian provinces. Quotes “The NWT JK-12 education system is undergoing important change as our government works toward improving student outcomes in the territory. Meeting with education leaders is vital to ensure we hear their feedback on these significant initiatives. I am pleased with the productive discussions we had today and look forward to continuing these conversations at future meetings.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment “I would like to thank the Minister and education leaders for their time today. There is exciting work being done in education renewal right now, so it is more important than ever for us to come together. The collaboration and friendships cultivated among education leaders is so valuable as we work closely toward the common goal of improving education outcomes for NWT youth.” -Erin Currie, DEA Chair, Yellowknife Catholic Schools   For more information contact: Christina Carrigan Manager, Communications and Public Affairs Department of Education, Culture and Employment Christina_carrigan@gov.nt.ca   Erin Currie DEA Chair, Yellowknife Catholic Schools erin.currie@ycs.nt.ca"

Yesterday, one of these PHA’s was issued that confirmed a new case of COVID-19 in Inuvik related to out-of-territory travel. It also identified potential public exposure during a flight to Inuvik. “Unfortunately I was on that flight and was seated in one of the affected rows, meaning I was potentially exposed to COVID-19. As soon as I was aware of this I started self-isolating. “In less than 24 hours after receiving the PHA and being notified of the potential exposure, I was in contact with Public Health, was tested for COVID-19, and have already received results from my first test that I tested negative. I will be tested again Thursday morning to confirm the results. I have also been told that there is no chance of transmission to anyone I may have been in contact with since returning to Inuvik, this past weekend.  “It is an uneasy feeling being told I may have been exposed to COVID-19 and that the virus is in Inuvik, but I take comfort in the fact that the public health orders that are in place have been working for over a year. I am confident that if we all continue to follow the public health measures we can help decrease the spread of the virus across our territory, and eventually get back to doing the things we love. “I also take comfort in the fact that though we still have a ways to go in getting our NWT population vaccinated, that there are over 20,000 people across the NWT who have already received both doses and are fully immunized. I am fortunate to be among that population and encourage all NWT residents who have yet to receive their vaccine to do so. “Though I received a negative test result, I am not out of the woods yet. I will continue to do my part to keep my family, friends and community safe and will follow all instructions from Public Health. “I want to thank everyone in advance for their concern. Let’s all continue to look after each other and please be kind to one another. And remember, if you haven’t received your vaccine - it’s not too late.

98,2021-04-25,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/premier-cochrane-provides-remarks-covid-19-situation-yellowknife,Government Website, Premier Cochrane provides remarks on COVID-19 situation in Yellowknife,"Northwest Territories Premier, Caroline Cochrane, issued the following statement on the current cases of COVID-19 and the evolving situation in Yellowknife: “The last few days have been a stark reminder of how quickly our pandemic situation in the Northwest Territories (NWT) could easily change if we let our guard down. Since the beginning, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) and the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) have been committed to protecting the health and well-being of residents. “This has been no easy task. Limiting the spread of COVID-19 takes the effort of everyone in the NWT to make it happen. Unlike our provincial counterparts, we have been fortunate enough to escape the multiple waves of rising cases that continue to have a significant impact on our southern neighbours. To date we have also been able to avoid the rising cases of variants of concern, and the uncertainty that the current wave has brought to provinces like B.C., Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec.  “As you are aware, several students and teachers are self-isolating because of the confirmed case at St. Patrick’s High School, along with multiple other residents from two local businesses. This is a situation that we hoped we would be able to avoid during this pandemic. However, that is not the case. And while we are not out of the woods just yet – this unfortunate situation is a reminder that residents need to continue to get vaccinated. “We need to achieve herd protection – especially when it comes to insulating our children from the virus until the health community deems it safe. We have a responsibility to protect them. “For the last 13 months, we have all worked hard to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the NWT, especially when it has come to those who are not able to get vaccinated at this time. Our youth are the future of the Northwest Territories, and until such time as people under the age of 18 are approved by Health Canada to get the vaccine, we all must do our part to protect them.   “While we are fortunate enough in the NWT to be looking at easing restrictions, the pandemic is not over. And no matter what, we all need to follow the isolation and public health orders to ensure we are protecting our communities and loved ones. There is no excuse for not following the orders. I want to be clear that there are consequences when people don’t follow them.  “As I have said before, it’s important during these moments that we practice compassion, kindness, and express empathy, especially for those who have COVID-19. If there is anything that this pandemic has shown us, it is that we can and will handle every challenge with the strength of our community behind us. “A big part of our success has been the huge efforts of residents, businesses, and leaders – and part of that success has been how we have supported one another through this pandemic. Please remember this in the coming days and weeks.  “Please, if you are eligible, go get vaccinated as soon as possible. Thank you.” "

GNWT hydrologists caution there will be a much higher snowmelt peak than usual, with a high likelihood of nearing or exceeding historic spring water levels.  This may have consequences for home, cabin, and property -owners in the NWT.   Taltson and Tazin River Basins The latest information suggests near-certain flooding on the Tazin and Taltson rivers.  Water levels in both basins continue to be the highest on record for this time of year and will be further affected by high snowpack. There is a high likelihood of exceeding the record high water levels experienced last fall. Other areas at elevated-risk  Many other water bodies in the NWT also experienced record high water levels during the summer and fall of 2020 due to significant rain. These high water levels have continued for many waterbodies through the winter and into spring. Higher snow levels in many areas are also expected to result in higher water during spring melt. The particular areas that are at elevated risk of flooding based on the latest data include:  Hay River - (Hay River, Great Slave Lake) Nahanni Butte - (South Nahanni River, Liard River) Fort Liard - (Liard River) Fort Simpson - (Liard River, Mackenzie River) Aklavik - (Mackenzie River) Yellowknife (Old Town area) - (Great Slave Lake) As is the case every year, NWT communities and cabins are at risk of ice jam floods regardless of preceding conditions. Examples of high flow rates across the NWT are shown in the following table (click to increase size).  111.jpg      Unpredictability It is not possible to say exactly how the melt season will go. That’s because the potential for flooding in lakes, rivers, and streams depends on many factors.  Timing of melt Intensity of melt Existing soil and basin conditions Current water levels Snow pack Rate of melt and rain events Break up conditions  Ice jams With this in-mind, residents should be prepared for some uncertainty this summer. The best thing to do is get prepared – and to do it as early as possible.  Get Prepared  Steps to prepare your home or cabin for a flood include: Moving valuables and equipment to a safe place. Removing or elevating electrical components. Removing or elevating carpets, furniture and mattresses. Know your community’s emergency plan and get prepared Related links Spring Water Levels Outlook 2021 Media Requests, please contact:  Jaimee Kepa Communications Planning Specialist Environment and Natural Resources Government of the Northwest Territories  Jaimee_Kepa@gov.nt.ca  867-767-9231, ext. 53045"
101,2021-04-22,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/unique-border-arrangement-still-place-fort-smith-area,Government Website, Unique Border Arrangement Still In Place for Fort Smith Area,"The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) advises Northwest Territories (NWT) residents that they can continue to travel in and out of the NWT at the Fort Smith border checkpoint without having to submit a Self-Isolation Plan or self-isolate upon entry to the NWT, in accordance with the Fort Smith Border Protocol. In the summer of 2020, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) implemented a checkpoint and pass system at the NWT-Alberta border in the Fort Smith area to maintain protections for COVID-19 in the NWT, while respecting deep ties between communities on either side. The border checkpoint in this area is busy, typically averaging over 300 crossings by vehicles per week. As spring weather arrives and camping season approaches, this checkpoint and pass system remain in place. The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) has recognized the situation of Fort Smith and surrounding area is significantly different than anywhere else in the NWT. As a result, requirements related to travel in the area are also different. The Fort Smith Border Protocol includes a pass system for residents from the NWT and Alberta representing various situations and activities commonly shared between Fort Smith, Fort Fitzgerald, Smith’s Landing, and other nearby communities. It also includes travel to and from Wood Buffalo National Park, including the Pine Lake area, Grosbeak Lake Trail and Salt River Day-Use Area. Passes may be easily picked up at the NWT-Alberta border and no advance call or notification is required. Anyone travelling south of the road system in Wood Buffalo National Park  is required to submit a Self-Isolation Plan and self-isolate upon entry to the NWT. For more information about COVID-19 and visiting Wood Buffalo National Park, call (867) 872-7960 or email pc.woodbuffaloinfo-infowoodbuffalo.pc@canada.ca For more information on travel requirements at the NWT-Alberta border in the Fort Smith area, contact 811 or email protectnwt@gov.nt.ca.   Media Requests, please contact: Darren Campbell Manager, COVID-19 Communications  Health and Social Services COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat Government of the Northwest Territories Darren_P_Campbell@gov.nt.ca"

This extension is being made under s.14 of the Emergency Management Act. The extension continues through May 6, 2021. This State of Emergency was initially instated to address the need for additional shelter space as a result of ongoing capacity limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continues its ongoing efforts to protect the health of the residents of the Northwest Territories. All residents are reminded to follow the orders and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer during this challenging time. This State of Emergency will be extended for as long as it is required."
103,2021-04-21,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/office-chief-public-health-officer-allows-remote-tourism-activities-resume,Government Website,The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer Allows Remote Tourism Activities to Resume,"The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) is allowing for remote tourism activities to resume in the Northwest Territories (NWT) for the 2021 summer season under certain conditions. NWT Tourism Operators will need to submit a Remote Tourism Operators COVID-19 Operations Plan to the OCPHO for authorization to host out-of-territory clients at remote sites in the NWT. To ensure out-of-territory visitors can self-isolate while NWT visitors and residents remain safe, these tourism operators must demonstrate that they can carry out business with no, or very minimal, contact between travellers and NWT residents who are not employees of the remote tourism operation. The Remote Tourism Operators COVID-19 Operations Plan is a critical component of this initiative. It will clarify how the licensed remote tourism operator will reduce the risk of COVID-19 being introduced and transmitted within the NWT and will demonstrate important details such as:  Transportation of workers and clients in and out of remote locations. Managing COVID-19 related illness in a remote setting. Medical extraction and medical capacity on site. On-site isolation, support and/or care for staff and clients should the need arise. Other mitigation plans for COVID-19 related arising risks. Supporting and ensuring client compliance with existing public health measures. This approach will provide remote tourism operators the opportunity to accommodate visitors during the important NWT summer tourism season, support Northern businesses, and provide jobs for NWT residents while continuing to keep our communities and residents healthy and safe.  Quotes “We are pleased to announce changes to public health measures that take into consideration our social and economic recovery as a territory. This is especially important for areas hardest hit by the pandemic, like the tourism sector. Through collaboration and partnership with Indigenous leadership, community governments, and partners like Northwest Territories Tourism, we are committed to working on the social and economic recovery of the Northwest Territories. Today is one step forward in what we hope will be a number of changes in the coming months.” -Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories, and Minister Responsible for the COVID19 Coordinating Secretariat   “The public health measures we’ve put in place have helped keep COVID-19 virus at bay in the NWT, but they have also presented challenges for tourism operators. As we continue to vaccinate more NWT residents, this innovative approach, developed in consultation with the tourism sector, strikes the right balance between protecting NWT residents from this virus and supporting remote tourism operators.” -Julie Green, Minister, Health and Social Services   “Tourism in the Northwest Territories was the first industry affected by COVID-19 and has been the hardest hit. We are grateful to our partners at the GNWT, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment, the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer, and particularly the COVID Secretariat, for their assistance in finding a way to resume some tourism activities while protecting the health of the residents of the NWT.” Harold Grinde, Chairperson, Northwest Territories Tourism Board of Directors Quick facts There are approximately 60 remote tourism operators in the NWT. A licensed remote tourism operator is one who is able to provide a fully self-contained tour experience, where clients, staff and workers do not have to rely on commercial accommodation or food services within an NWT community, except while in transit. Scheduled overnight layovers that are necessary for clients in transit to remote tourism sites must only take place in Yellowknife, Hay River, Inuvik, Fort Smith, Fort Simpson and Norman Wells.

104,2021-04-21,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/self-isolation-time-period-changes-travellers-fully-vaccinated-covid-19-vaccine-coverage,Government Website,Self-isolation time period changes for travellers fully vaccinated; COVID-19 vaccine coverage data publicly released,"The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) is introducing new measures that reduce self-isolation requirements for travellers who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Additionally, it is releasing the first set of regional and territorial COVID-19 vaccine coverage data on the NWT COVID-19 dashboard. Reduction of self-isolation requirements The self-isolation changes introduce the opportunity for testing on the eighth day of the 14-day self-isolation period for fully vaccinated persons entering the Northwest Territories (NWT). If those test results are negative for COVID-19, individuals will only be required to self-monitor and wear a mask for the remainder of the 14-day timeframe. They will no longer be required to self-isolate during that period. Changes will also reduce self-isolation requirements for household members. The announcement comes after conducting an NWT-specific risk assessment. The assessment considers the high-risk profile of the NWT population due to its remoteness, and limited NWT health system capacity. Results conclude that shorter isolation periods can take place to mitigate broader societal and economic costs of the pandemic. The determining factor is that fully vaccinated persons pose a significantly reduced importation risk to the NWT, which can be further mitigated by an initial seven-day isolation period and negative COVID-19 test.  The self-isolation requirement changes are applicable to all fully vaccinated travellers entering the NWT under existing exemption criteria. This is to ensure sufficient measures are taken to mitigate any possible spread of COVID-19, including variants of concern. COVID-19 vaccine coverage data With this first set of regional and territorial COVID-19 vaccine coverage data, overall, the Northwest Territories (NWT) is reporting 63% of adults have their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 51% are fully vaccinated with both doses. While these percentages are impressive given the complexity of COVID-19 vaccine delivery in the NWT, there is still more work that needs to be done to achieve optimal vaccination rates. In the spirit of transparency and collaboration, community-specific vaccine coverage data has been shared with Indigenous and community leadership. Community-specific data will not be posted to the public dashboard in order to protect communities with low uptake from public criticism or stigma. Vaccine coverage calculations exclude those with out-of-territory health care who were vaccinated in the NWT. Similar to COVID-19 case reporting, out-of-territory residents do not contribute to the NWT’s overall vaccine coverage. The number of vaccine doses given across the territory will continue to be updated weekly on the COVID-19 website banner in line with reporting to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Quotes “We have always been committed to relaxing restrictions when the evidence was there that we could do so in the safest manner possible. This change reflects the protection that is provided by vaccines, and I encourage all eligible adults to get vaccinated. It is the most effective weapon we have stop the spread of COVID-19. Though the NWT may be fortunate to be a leader in vaccinating residents, that doesn’t mean that our risk to bringing the virus into the territory is gone and we’ll need to wait for the rest of Canada to catch up to us.” -Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories and Minister Responsible for the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat   “I am pleased to announce these changes to self-isolation requirements and the release of vaccine coverage data for the NWT. We can see in other jurisdictions that easing public health measures and getting a sufficient supply of vaccines for residents is not the norm. We are fortunate to be in a position today to continue to take steps forward to gradually reduce restrictions. I also hope the vaccine coverage data will reinforce that, while we have done an admirable job in our vaccine rollout, there is more work to do to ensure our communities are sufficiently protected against COVID-19.” -Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services   “The NWT is in a unique situation today with our ability to take a careful, measured approach to easing public health measures and vaccinate all eligible members of our population. We must continue to be vigilant in our pandemic response as we work to increase vaccination rates across the NWT and keep COVID-19 at bay.” -Dr. Kami Kandola, Chief Public Health Officer of the Northwest Territories Quick facts Non-essential travel outside the NWT is still not recommended as there remains significant levels of COVID-19 activity across much of Canada. This change to self-isolation requirements will not apply to anyone entering the NWT from international travel. International travellers will still be required to follow the federal government’s quarantine rules even if fully vaccinated. For the purposes of this measure, people are considered fully vaccinated 14 days  after they have received the second dose in a two-dose series (such as Moderna) or more than two weeks after they have received a single-dose vaccine (such Johnson and Johnson (J&J)/Janssen). The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is reported to be 92% efficacious 14 days or more after the first dose, and 94% efficacious 14 days or more after the second dose.

A draft is ready – and the Bathurst Caribou Advisory Committee is looking for your contributions to make sure we end up with the best possible plan.   How to Participate: 13 sharing sessions will be held with leadership, harvesters, and traditional knowledge-holders selected by local leadership. They are being held via Zoom to keep folks safe as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Any individual or organization may also submit comments any time online. Plain language background material has been produced to assist in meaningful engagement. The comment period is open through May 31, 2021. About the Draft Plan: The proposed plan includes “management actions” – the steps all co-management partners can take to support Bathurst caribou and the long-term resilience of the herd. These actions will bring all groups together in taking appropriate action throughout the natural phases of the caribou population cycle. The end goal is to turn around the decline, get the herd to recovery, and do our part to help them thrive over the long-term. The management plan includes recommendations from the 2019 Bathurst Caribou Range Plan – which outlines how land use and habitat should be managed to best support the Bathurst herd. The draft plan was co-developed between 17 organizations representing public governments, Indigenous governments and organizations, hunter and trapper associations, and management boards spanning the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Saskatchewan.  Quote “Caribou have sustained generations in our territory – and our government has a responsibility to do everything we can to help ensure they’ll sustain many more. With the Bathurst herd in real trouble, we’re pleased to be moving forward with urgency to chart a strong path to recovery and resilience. With collaboration across the North, and valued perspectives from the public, I am confident we will get this plan right.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Quick facts Comments can be sent to BCP-PCB@gov.nt.ca  The Bathurst caribou herd has undergone a significant decline – with a decrease in number of nearly 98% since 1986. In 2012, the GNWT instituted a no-hunting zone based on location data from collaring and monitoring animals to protect the Bathurst Herd. This is known as the Core Bathurst Caribou Mobile Zone.

110,2021-04-15,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/isolation-and-vaccination-information-returning-nwt-students,Government Website,Isolation and Vaccination Information for Returning NWT Students,"In anticipation of Northwest Territories’ (NWT) students returning from studies outside the territory, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is offering  the following information about self-isolation and vaccinations. All NWT students returning to the territory must submit a Resident Self-Isolation Plan prior to their return and self-isolate when they arrive. In their isolation plan, students will be able to identify if they require accommodation in an isolation centre. Isolation centres in Fort Smith, Hay River, Inuvik and Yellowknife are available free-of-charge to all returning students and their dependents.  Students may be able to isolate in their own accommodation, provided it has its own entrance, kitchen and bathroom, or in the family home if all members isolate together. This opportunity is available in Fort Smith, Hay River, Fort Simpson, Yellowknife, Norman Wells and Inuvik. Adult NWT students are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine after their self-isolation period is complete. Students who live in Fort Simpson, Fort Smith, Hay River, Inuvik, or Norman Wells can contact their local public health unit to arrange vaccination in their home community. Those living in Yellowknife can book online or by calling (867) 767-9120. Adult NWT students returning to smaller communities outside of the regional centres mentioned above who would like to get vaccinated must e-mail CPHO@gov.nt.ca and provide: Their full name Their contact phone number Their home community The community they will be isolating in upon return to the NWT Their date of arrival in the NWT The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) will arrange to vaccinate these students before their return home. Students who do not return to the NWT for the summer are unlikely to qualify to get the COVID-19 vaccine in another province or territory where they are not a resident. The GNWT encourages all eligible NWT residents to get vaccinated to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their communities against COVID-19. It is much safer to get the vaccine than to get the disease. Quotes “All adult residents in all 33 communities across the NWT are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, including adult students returning home after out-of-territory studies. Vaccinating all eligible residents is important for the health and safety of our communities.” -Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services   “The health and safety of our residents and communities is of the utmost importance. I encourage all returning post-secondary students to do their part and get vaccinated so that we can continue to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities from COVID-19.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment Quick facts The NWT has received a total of 51,600 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from the Federal government to vaccinate 75% of the adult population. NWT students studying outside the territory are included in the vaccine allotment. There are five isolation facilities in the NWT; two in Yellowknife and one each in Fort Smith, Hay River, and Inuvik. A Self-Isolation Plan is a legal commitment to self-isolate when you enter the NWT and is enforceable under the territory’s COVID-19 public health orders.

114,2021-04-13,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/gnwt-expands-wastewater-surveillance-fort-liard,Government Website,GNWT expands wastewater surveillance to Fort Liard,"The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) recently added the community of Fort Liard to the Northwest Territories’ (NWT) program to test human wastewater for the presence of the virus that causes COVID-19.  The first wastewater samples from Fort Liard were collected in March via sampling devices installed on effluent pipes on the community’s trucked sewer system. Fort Liard joins six other NWT communities where wastewater surveillance is being conducted. The other communities are Fort Simpson, Fort Smith, Hay River, Inuvik, Norman Wells and Yellowknife. Fort Liard was identified as a priority community for wastewater testing because of  its proximity to northern B.C. communities that have seen a sharp spike in COVID-19 cases. Wastewater surveillance is a cost-effective way to test for COVID-19. Positive test results (signals) in a community with no known COVID-19 cases can help public health officials to take action that will reduce viral spread. The territory’s wastewater samples are analyzed at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, and also at the GNWT’s Environment and Natural Resources’ (ENR) Taiga Laboratory. Results are compared in a quality assurance process before Taiga Lab begins leading all wastewater testing for NWT samples. NWT wastewater test results are available online 5-10 days after collection, following review by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (see NWT COVID-19 dashboard at https://www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19/). The surveillance program is a collaboration among community governments, the departments of ENR, Municipal and Community Affairs and Health and Social Services, and the Public Health Agency of Canada, including the National Microbiology Laboratory. The program is expected to be in place for the next 12 months.  Quote “Information is power in a pandemic. The addition of Fort Liard to the GNWT’s wastewater surveillance program gives another community access to more information that can help keep them safe during the pandemic. Wastewater surveillance provides us with an early warning system to detect COVID-19 and we thank our partners for collaborating with us to operate this program. It is a valuable resource as we work to keep the virus at bay in our territory.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick facts Over 50 per cent of the NWT’s population is covered by the wastewater surveillance program, including all communities with isolation centres. Sampling and testing methods differ for piped and trucked sewer systems. The first communities participating in the wastewater surveillance program were chosen based on having piped collection systems that lend themselves to autosampler equipment used to collect wastewater samples. The ability to do wastewater surveillance in additional communities is being assessed in relation to public health needs and available technology and resources. In addition to the laboratory services and expertise from the Public Health Agency of Canada, federal funding from Health Canada ($216,000) and Indigenous Services Canada ($275,000) has been instrumental in supporting one-time and ongoing costs for the GNWT’s wastewater surveillance program.

This was most evident during his time as a decorated naval officer during the Second World War. He spent much of his life working to help others and provide opportunities to those who may not have been as fortunate. “Through his community work and philanthropy, His Royal Highness has empowered millions of young people around the world to strive for greatness and believe in themselves, including many Canadians. “Many Northerners will remember his visit to the Northwest Territories in 1970 as part of the celebrations around the hundredth anniversary of the creation of the Northwest Territories. With his loving life partner, Queen Elizabeth II, they visited Inuvik, Tuktoyaktuk, Yellowknife, Fort Smith, and Fort Providence., where they kicked off a canoe race down the Mackenzie River. “Prince Philip cared deeply about leaving the world in a better place for future generations to come, so they could have all the opportunities they could hope and dream of. His work in the volunteer sector, his interest in wildlife conservation has left a long-lasting impact across the globe. “On behalf of all Northwest Territories residents, I want to extend my deepest condolences to Her Majesty, the Queen, and the entire Royal Family during this difficult time.”"

Poor oral health is a significant issue in the NWT, especially among children and youth. The Speak the Tooth Campaign will increase knowledge and help change behaviour related to oral health. NWT children aged five to ten were selected to appear on social media, TV and radio ads, posters and other materials to deliver oral health messages in a non-judgmental way and inspire parents, caregivers and everyone in all communities to get involved in promoting good oral health. Posters and ‘tooth tip cards’ for all ages will be available in all 11 NWT official languages. The Speak the Tooth Campaign is part of the three year GNWT 2018 Oral Health Action Plan’s multi-directional approach towards improving the NWT population’s oral health status. The Action Plan focuses on innovative oral health promotion; supporting the integration of oral health into primary health care; improving systemic supports; and providing sustainable, culturally safe services. To see the video, visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvXyegitIyY. Quote: “It’s exciting to have children from all communities help ‘Speak the Tooth’ about oral health and share good oral health habits. We know the truth—oral health is critical for the well-being of babies, young people and adults throughout their lives.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick facts: Untreated oral disease has been shown to: 		contribute to poor nutrition uptake due to chewing difficulty affecting growth; and lead to chronic pain which can affect sleep patterns, concentration and the ability to learn, and contributes to school absenteeism.  The Speak the Tooth Campaign aims to raise awareness of the importance of oral health and change key oral health behaviours, particularly in families.

In announcing this second consecutive annual exemption today, Premier Caroline Cochrane noted the Easter Bunny has received both doses of the Moderna vaccine to undertake another year of  COVID-safe Easter deliveries to NWT children. The Easter Bunny must adhere to the following evidence-based rules to minimize any public health risk of COVID spread while delivering treats on the weekend: Inside deliveries of Easter goodies may only occur while children are safely asleep in their beds. Outside deliveries are permitted anytime during the exemption period as safe physical distancing is easier to achieve outdoors. The Easter Bunny is required to wash its paws, front and back, before entering and after leaving any delivery location. A fabric mask specifically designed to accommodate long ears and whiskers must be worn at all times and replaced before entering any of the territory’s 33 communities. As much as possible, deliveries should be restricted to wrapped goodies. The Government of the Northwest Territories thanks the Easter Bunny for helping to protect the health and safety of NWT families by being fully vaccinated before visiting the territory. The Premier and all MLAs also extend thanks to Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola for allowing the exemption in recognition of the dedication all NWT children have shown to following COVID-safe behaviours since the start of the pandemic. Quotes “I am pleased to welcome the Easter Bunny back to the Northwest Territories for a second time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Necessary public health safety measures slow the rate at which the Easter Bunny can work, and I am grateful the Easter Bunny is determined to visit all our communities. It will be a wonderful treat to NWT children, who continue to work hard to keep themselves and each other safe during these unprecedented times.” - Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories “I encourage all children to help the Easter Bunny by going to bed early on Saturday night. And, if you are lucky enough to see the Easter Bunny hopping around during the daytime, please remember to stay two metres apart. I promise that you’ll be able to safely return to big bunny hugs after the pandemic. Happy Easter, everyone!” - Dr. Kami Kandola, Chief Public Health Officer of the Northwest Territories Quick facts The Easter Bunny fully complied with all restrictions attached to the exemption to self-isolate granted by the Chief Public Health Officer last year. Research by community health authorities showed no incidents of infection or illness linked to the Easter Bunny’s 2020 visit to the Northwest Territories last year, and measures of the total well-being in the NWT significantly increased. Throughout recorded history, the Easter Bunny has safely delivered eggs, treats and unconditional love to children all over the world.

This government committed to reducing the funding gap by $5 million, and we have made significant progress on this goal.  This past fiscal year we added $2.594 million of ongoing funding for community governments.    Earlier this year Municipal and Community Affairs, or MACA, engaged with the Northwest Territories Association of Communities, to identify how best to strategically invest this new funding.  Knowing that the largest funding gap is in Community Public Infrastructure, it was decided that this funding would be allocated to this priority.  This additional funding therefore is earmarked for those 19 community governments who have capital funding gaps. In addition to the infrastructure investment, an additional $740,000 has been approved in the 2021-2022 budget which MACA is allocating to the Environmental Services fund to support community governments with the delivery of water, sewer, and solid waste services for residents. Mr. Speaker, our mandate commitment is more than just a funding initiative, it also includes a commitment to provide communities with new opportunities to raise additional revenue. In 2021, MACA along with the Department of Lands and the Department of Executive and Indigenous Affairs have been developing a process guide for municipal governments to manage lands within their municipal boundaries.  As part of this process we are also considering current Government of the Northwest Territories policies and procedures that may require amendments.  The transfer of lands would better position municipal governments to have administration and control of lands within their community, remove barriers for land transfers, allowing communities to advance their own priorities for land development and present more own-source revenue opportunities. MACA’s commitment also includes working with communities to reduce or stabilize the cost of delivering core programs and services. This summer we will be working with communities in the Beaufort Delta and Sahtu regions to coordinate removal of hazardous waste stockpiles within their landfills. This project, as part of the implementation of the NWT Waste Resource Management Strategy, will reduce contamination of NWT lands and extend the lifespans of community landfills. Work will continue in other regions as federal funding has been applied for to continue this work. We are also working towards implementing the NWT Asset Management Strategy for communities. The Asset Management Strategy will provide communities with more information to implement best practices, improve maintenance and lower costs due to equipment failures and emergency repairs. MACA has already trained six communities to use a computerized asset management program and have plans for up to seven more in 2021. Mr. Speaker, with the additional investment for community governments I am proud to say we are well on our way to meet our mandate commitment. The department will continue to advance this mandate commitment in future years to include the remaining $1.7 million to reach the total mandate investment of $5 million.  We know the challenges our community governments are facing and we will continue to advocate and support them to address their priorities wherever possible. Mahsi, Mr. Speaker."

This nation-wide initiative, held every March, is an opportunity for Canada’s 10 million French-speakers and all Canadians to celebrate and promote French language and culture. Through this year’s Rendez-vous de la Francophonie theme, Acadia, at the heart of my country, celebrations will highlight the fact that Acadia is the birthplace of Canada’s Francophonie, while acknowledging the presence and contribution of Indigenous peoples in North America for thousands of years. Monsieur le President, as we celebrate Rendez-vous de la Francophonie, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the Francophone Affairs Secretariat. In response to COVID-19, they quickly adapted to provide prompt translations 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. Their dedication has allowed our francophone residents to access important health information in French throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you.

130,2021-03-31,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-archie-update-winter-road-season-and-community-fuel-resupply,Government Website,Diane Archie: Update on Winter Road Season and Community Fuel Resupply,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, one of the priorities of our government is to make strategic infrastructure investments that connect communities, expand the economy, and reduce the cost of living.  There are a number of initiatives being undertaken to support this priority, and one of those is to continue to seek ways to advance the construction of all-season roads such as the Mackenzie Valley Highway and the Tłı̨chǫ Highway. Mr. Speaker, investments in all-season roads take time and money. Our government will continue to pursue these projects, but in the meantime, winter roads remain an essential part of the Northwest Territories’ transportation system. Communities across the North rely heavily on these roads to ensure the movement of goods and people during colder months. Today, I am pleased to provide an update on the 2021 winter road season and fuel resupply activities. Every year, highway crews in the Beaufort Delta, Sahtu, Deh Cho and North Slave regions build and maintain 1,469 kilometres of winter roads, ice roads and ice crossing, connecting 11 communities that are not served by our all-season roads. The NWT’s short winter-road season is critical, as our winter roads are the primary way essential goods are delivered to remote communities. This access helps to diversify the NWT economy, allows businesses to be more competitive, and lowers costs for northern residents. I would like to personally thank our highway crews across the territory for their hard work and dedication to opening and maintaining winter roads this past year, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. These crews overcame fluctuating temperatures and other impacts of climate change to get our winter roads operating and in some cases, earlier than average opening dates. To enhance the level of service on some of our winter roads, our government has also formed partnerships with the private sector. Specifically, we have an agreement with Enbridge Pipelines in which the company provides funding to the GNWT to accelerate the construction of the Tulita and Wrigley ice crossings on Highway No. 1 to support the movement of equipment. Mr. Speaker, our government understands the importance of essential goods, such as fuel, for residents and businesses in northern communities. Many communities rely heavily on diesel and gasoline for electricity generation, heating, and transportation. The GNWT is responsible for the purchase, transport, and storage of fuel for 16 communities in the Northwest Territories that are not served by the private sector. Local contractors then sell and distribute these petroleum products to residents and businesses. Despite the challenge of COVID-19, residents can rest assured that the GNWT will continue to deliver fuel while taking every precaution necessary to protect our communities. Our staff and contractors have put rigorous safety measures in place to minimize risks related to COVID, while following the orders and recommendations of the NWT Chief Public Health Officer. This winter, the GNWT’s first fuel delivery took place on February 1. It is expected that fuel resupply will be completed by mid-April, with a total of 7.5 million litres of fuel delivered to seven communities. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the staff and contractors for keeping our communities connected safely, efficiently and reliably. Our government will continue to work with our public and private sector partners to maintain dependable supply of goods and services to our communities, while identifying opportunities to improve our operations and infrastructure. Quyanainni, Mr. Speaker."

The Mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) includes the commitment to increase JK-12 student educational outcomes to the same level as the rest of Canada. To meet this Mandate commitment, and respond to the findings of the mid-term evaluation of Education Renewal and Innovation (ERI) and the 2020 report of the Office of the Auditor General, ECE has developed an Action Plan to Improve JK-12 Student Outcomes. The plan categorizes actions by seven themes: Quality Early Learning and Child Care Workforce Development and Capacity Building Curriculum and Student Assessment Student Supports Training, Developing and Support for School Employees Governance Monitoring and Evaluation Deliverables and timelines for completion are included for each of the action items. The public can monitor the GNWT’s progress on these action items, and read the Action Plan, on ECE’s website. Key among the action items is ECE’s work to modernize the Education Act and renew JK-12 curriculum. Both initiatives are underway, with public engagement occurring on Education Act Modernization from now until June 2021, and direct engagement on JK-12 curriculum renewal taking place over the coming months with Indigenous governments, key education stakeholders and the public Quote “How we deliver equitable education in the Northwest Territories is critical for ensuring the development of accomplished, capable northerners.

133,2021-03-30,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-tourism-2025-roadmap-recovery,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Tourism 2025: Roadmap to Recovery,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, later today I will table Tourism 2025: Roadmap to Recovery. It is the new five-year plan for the future growth of tourism in the Northwest Territories. It was originally conceived as a Strategy that would build upon the success of Tourism 2010, Tourism 2015 and Tourism 2020.  Each of these strategies set a goal for visitor spending and every one of them exceeded their goal, with total visitor spending estimated to have risen from $130 million during the Tourism 2010 period up to an estimated $210.1 million during the time of Tourism 2020. The success of 	Tourism 2020 was in spite of the severe decline that began in the last part of the strategy when COVID-19 arrived in the spring of 2020. Mr. Speaker, Tourism 2025 is a strategy for the future. It does not change the reality that until visitors return to the NWT, economic relief measures are still needed.   The goal for Tourism 2025 has shifted from one of continued growth to achieving recovery with an ambitious goal to be back to the high numbers seen in 2018-2019 for both visitor numbers and visitor spend. To achieve this in the medium term, we need our industry to survive the pandemic. So, before I speak further about 	Tourism 2025, let me briefly note some of the shorter-term efforts being made. We continue to work with the Government of Canada and Northwest Territories Tourism to find ways to meet the immediate needs of NWT tourism businesses and the industry as a whole. Federal Northern Business Relief and Regional Relief and Recovery Funds have been available to help tourism businesses cover operational costs. For those tourism businesses that exhausted this funding, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment filled the gap. Thanks to our partnership with Canada’s Northern Economic Development Agency, we have provided opportunities for tourism businesses to invest in, upgrade, or pivot their operations and services.  Three million dollars is being invested in 99 tourism initiatives across the territory under the Growth and Recovery by Investing in Tourism, or GRIT Fund. Together with Northwest Territories Tourism, we invested in training initiatives like digital boot camps for tourism businesses to learn and upgrade their online marketing skills. The promotion of staycations allowed tourism businesses to deliver their products to a new and overwhelmingly supportive local market. Our campaigns did more than generate much-needed revenue; it awakened us as Northerners collectively to be better customers and ambassadors of our own tourism product. Just as the pandemic is not over, neither are the GNWT’s efforts to continue finding opportunities to partner with other funders to maximize funding and to identify gaps in funding programs that we can help fill. Mr. Speaker, the Department conducted industry engagements in preparation for Tourism 2025 twice; first in the fall of 2019 but then again in the spring of 2020 in order to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the industry and determine whether there was a shift in needs, opportunities or priorities. What we learned may be surprising to some. While the reasons behind their priorities may have changed, the fundamental needs of the industry have not. The message from the tourism industry was clear and direct; government investment is needed, more now than ever, in tourism infrastructure, industry and product development, communication and market research. From that engagement with stakeholders came four strategic priorities for 	Tourism 2025. They are: Invest in infrastructure, enhancements to products and services, and development of new products and services; Build capacity among operators and tourism staff through training and mentorship; Engage with tourism stakeholders, through enhanced communications and marketing efforts; and, Gather and report key data, information and insights to guide and evaluate investments. The Tourism 2025 strategy includes specific activities under each strategic priority and the anticipated outcomes of that work. Mr. Speaker, the world wants to come to the Northwest Territories. The marketing efforts of Northwest Territories Tourism, our destination marketing organization, won international awards for their marketing efforts focused on telling the stories of the NWT. Yellowknife, a gateway to all of the Northwest Territories, was named as one of National Geographic’s 2021 places to visit. That designation is not tied to any single moment in time and will not be lost in light of the tourism delays imposed by COVID-19. Being a place to go is tied to the spectacular stories that we have to tell. It will take time and it will take work, but we will recover.  Our borders will open, and the Northwest Territories will once again take its place as a spectacular tourism destination. When we get there, and we will, Tourism 2025: Roadmap to Recovery will be in place to guide and grow our industry into the future.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

To date, the COVID-19 emergency support funding for sport organizations has provided a total of $1.846 million for communities and sport organizations in order to: Adapt their programs to meet public health requirements, Train and prepare staff and volunteers, Purchase specialized equipment, and most importantly of all, and Continue to offer sport and recreation programming for the mental health and physical well-being of our residents. This is an increase of $263,000 above the $1.583 million I announced last fall. Mr. Speaker, many of our residents benefit greatly from the investments we make in sport and recreation. These additional investments, supported by the Government of Canada, are especially important for: our elderly residents, those with disabilities, people living in isolated communities, and those who cannot afford program fees. The mental and physical benefits of participation in all types of physical activity, recreation and sport are well documented.  Those benefits include: Improved mental health, Improved heart and lung capacity, Better sleeping patterns, Control over chronic diseases like diabetes, Reduced stress, and Increased self-esteem. Sport and recreation investments are also important for leadership development by offering training for coaches and officials, developing role models, and by building administrative capacity in volunteer organizations.   Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 emergency support funding for communities and sport organizations has already supported many activities. I would like to share a few examples with Members today: In Kakisa, the Ka’a’gee Tu First Nation has built a 5-kilometer trail on the south side of their community for Elders and all community members to get outside and enjoy the land.  The trail is being used for walking, snowshoeing, snowmobiling and ice fishing at the river.  It also gives community members easy access to firewood to heat their homes. Families have been gathering at the river for cookouts, fishing and other cultural practices. Community members are very happy with access to the trail and for the employment opportunities its construction provided for community members. In Tuktoyaktuk, the Hamlet’s Recreation Department partnered with the Tuktoyaktuk Community Corporation, Aimayunga Woman Shelter, Jason Jacobson Youth Centre, and the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation Student and Family Support Program on several activities including: 		A drive through healthy foods feast with over 600 meals being provided for families before Christmas, and Outdoor games day on January 16 as part of the Sunrise Festival with Elders story telling, a fishing derby, tug-of-war and a harpoon throwing competition.  In Fort Good Hope, the community used their funding to support outdoor sport activities.  These were well received because they: 		Allowed the participants to maintain physical distancing requirements, and Allowed for purchase of new equipment so that fewer people were 				handling it.  In Tulita, the community used the funding to provide more programming, particularly for Elders who have been greatly impacted by the pandemic. The COVID-19 emergency support funding for sport organizations has allowed these and many other activities to occur during a very difficult time. This latest top-up will continue this support. The ingenuity and innovation of communities and sport organizations has been simply wonderful and for that I thank them. Mahsi, Mr. Speaker."

This is a good time for us to reflect on the past year to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been a long haul for all of us.  The first case of COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories was confirmed on March 21st, 2020.  That was just shortly after the first Public Health Order restricted travel within the NWT and required all travellers coming in to isolate for 14 days in one of the four hub communities.  In an effort to protect NWT residents and our health system, the Chief Public Health Officer also advised that all non-essential services and businesses were to be closed. The Emerging Wisely Plan was released in May 2020. It provided a framework for how the NWT would maintain the strong public health measures developed to contain the spread of COVID-19 and eventually ease them.  Mr. Speaker, we are in a very different place than we were last year thanks to our collective efforts to follow the public health orders and measures for our own safety and the safety of our communities.  While other provinces and territories have gone through repeated lockdowns, we have stayed the course to limit the spread of COVID-19 and avoid some of the most devastating impacts of the virus. NWT businesses, community groups and other orders of government have created innovative ways to comply with the public health orders, or they have been granted permission to open up earlier than envisioned. Residents can enjoy sports such as hockey, squash and curling. Businesses have increased their capacity, while still maintaining physical distancing and other controls. Mr. Speaker, we have learned how to reduce and live with the risk of COVID-19. Over time, we have been able to enjoy relative freedom within our borders because of the orders in place, and residents’ willingness to follow these orders. We all recognize this has not been easy. Restrictions on businesses, gatherings, travel, and the requirement for mandatory self-isolation have all taken a toll. We look forward to the day when all restrictions can be lifted and we are getting closer.    The Chief Public Health Officer has advised that she is currently working with the COVID-19 Secretariat to assess the future and look at targeted initiatives to ease some restrictions. She has committed to review Emerging Wisely during the month of April. There are a number of variables that will inform her decision including: •How effective the vaccine is to prevent transmission of the virus; • When vaccines will be approved to be administered to everyone. Some measures must be maintained to protect children under 18 and others who cannot take the vaccine for whatever reason; and •How well the vaccine protects against the emerging variants such as those from the UK, South Africa and Brazil.  High overall vaccine uptake will be important to take into consideration as the Chief Public Health Officer assesses the risk level in the NWT. We strongly encourage all eligible residents to get vaccinated to help protect themselves and their communities from 	COVID-19.  Mr. Speaker, as of Monday, March 29 over 23,722 people have received dose one of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in the NWT, and 13,933 have had both doses. Vaccine teams are currently going for third visits to many small communities to reach those who may have missed the clinics before or are ready to receive the vaccine now. All residents aged 18 and over in all 33 communities across the NWT are able to book vaccine appointments.  I anticipate a significant number of NWT residents will be fully vaccinated by the end of April, months ahead of many southern provinces.   Having as many people vaccinated as possible is the key to moving forward. I am happy to be part of the group of NWT residents who are now fully vaccinated and would like to express my appreciation to the vaccination teams.  Mr. Speaker, with a vaccine uptake between approximately 58 to 62 percent, we will require higher vaccine uptake in order to relax public health measures. That could mean larger groups of people getting together at home, at community gatherings and at business locations.  The Chief Public Health Officer will then look at how to modify the self-isolation requirements and travel restrictions, while we watch how the rest of Canada manages the spread of new variants and the roll out of the vaccine. While the NWT has responded effectively to date to protect NWT residents, we need to remember that we are still in the middle of a global pandemic. We will see more and more things open up this spring and summer.  Mr. Speaker, we still must maintain some measures to protect those who are not able to receive the vaccine. I urge residents to remain patient, to do their part and get vaccinated if they are able to do so, encourage friends and loved ones to get their vaccine, and to keep up those healthy habits we have adopted since the beginning. It is through collective efforts that we have so far been successful in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will count on these efforts as we move forward.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

As Minister Responsible for Youth, I want to point out that young people can accomplish many incredible initiatives when they are motivated and take charge. I would start by using the example of the Western Arctic Youth Collective’s Local 2 Global Community Exchange held in Inuvik on March 2nd to 4th of this year.  The organizers, a group of very dedicated young people, recently received an Arctic Inspiration Prize which will help resource and highlight this event.  It was a wonderful recognition of an inspiring effort by northern youth. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs also has resources that 	can assist with youth initiatives whether they are led by youth or youth supporting organizations.   These include the: NWT Youth Corps – including support for larger multiyear projects, Youth Contributions – designed for smaller one-time events, Regional Youth Sport Events – focused on schools and communities to support tournaments in our regional centres and our smaller communities, and Children Youth Resiliency Program – that supports existing or new programs intending to help younger residents with learning the basics of physical literacy and mental health resiliency. There are also dozens of programs that the Department supports through other organizations including: Northern Youth Abroad, Western Arctic Moving Pictures, Dechinta Centre for Research and Learning, Foster Family Coalition, and Smaller local and regional projects through community governments and school agencies. I also want to encourage youth to consider the NWT Youth Ambassador Program.  	The program offers a guided and structured volunteer experience.  Participants have the opportunity to develop life and job skills as well as to build the confidence necessary to deal with complex life challenges.  Later this spring the Department will be announcing a 2021 online event.  Mr. Speaker, youth can reach out to any Municipal and Community Affairs Offices for more information on the opportunities available.  	In closing, I want our youth to know that your communities and the Government of the Northwest Territories are here to support you.  Please reach out to local staff and representatives to discuss ideas that you may have on what programs, activities or initiatives that may help you and other youth in your communities feel empowered and more resilient.  Some great initiatives have resulted from discussions like this in the past. It is so often the youth who show us what is possible.    Mahsi, Mr. Speaker."

The success of the Water Strategy is based on four main areas that require concentrated efforts: Work Together, Know and Plan, Use Responsibly, and Check Our Progress. Examples of key responsibilities under each component include: negotiating and implementing transboundary water management agreements under the Work Together component; implementing research and monitoring throughout the Northwest Territories lakes and rivers under Know and Plan; reviewing and developing guidelines and regulations to clarify regulatory and environmental assessment processes under Use Responsibly; and regularly reviewing and reporting on implementation of activities in our Action Plans under Check Our Progress.   Traditional knowledge is an integral part of the Water Strategy, providing valuable information and important guidance for all stewardship actions. Specific actions on the importance and inclusion of traditional knowledge are identified in all four components of the Water Strategy. The next Action Plan to support the Water Strategy will cover the period of 2021-2025 and will build on momentum we have gained over the last decade. This new plan will address current priorities for water stewardship in the Northwest Territories.   As part of developing the next Action Plan, we have worked with and engaged our water partners to continue to understand NWT water priorities to ensure northern voices are reflected.  Mr. Speaker, we thank all who took time to participate. Upon finalizing the next Action Plan, we will release a What We Heard document that will show how this important engagement informed the plan. Mr. Speaker, we are also making progress on modernizing the existing Yukon-NWT Transboundary Water Management Agreement signed in 2002.  We have updated the agreement that commit us to responsibly manage shared waters in the Peel and Mackenzie Delta basins, and developed a similar new agreement for the Liard River Basin.  These new agreements are consistent with the Water Strategy and the 2015 agreements signed with Alberta and British Columbia.  Consultation has occurred and public engagement ended on March 15. We are now reviewing this feedback to ensure that it is addressed.  Mr. Speaker, beginning last summer, the water levels on Great Slave Lake reached record highs, as did water levels in many rivers flowing into it.  We know Northerners have questions about why this happened, and we are actively working to provide answers.  Our government, alongside experts from the governments of Alberta, British Columbia, and Canada, worked together on an analysis of our major shared waterways, such as the Peace and Athabasca Rivers.   We learned that these high-water levels were driven by high snow and rainfall across northern British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.  Based on this information, we anticipate Great Slave Lake water levels will not likely return to normal for a while. Current conditions are unprecedented and what happens over the next few months will depend on several things: like the timing and volume of precipitation, the timing and rate of snow an ice melt in the spring and the thickness of river and lake ice.   Mr. Speaker, partnerships are what water stewardship is all about.  This government is committed to working together to ensure that the waters of the Northwest Territories remain clean, abundant and productive for all time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
139,2021-03-29,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-investing-agriculture,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Investing in Agriculture ,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, the season for planting may still be a long way off but February 23rd was Agriculture Day in Canada and we have much to celebrate and work towards in support of agriculture in the Northwest Territories. I will also speak to the connection between the agriculture industry and efforts to strengthen food security.   Despite the snow and still frigid temperatures, right now is, in fact, an important time of planning and investment for food growers and harvesters across our country and in the Northwest Territories.  Mr. Speaker, as we mark Agriculture Day this year, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment is preparing to implement the fourth year of the GNWT’s Agriculture Strategy, The Business of Food- A Food Production Plan. Since 2017, we have invested in planning, training, capacity building, community partnerships and regulatory improvements designed to position our commercial agriculture sector to increase its production of fresh, healthy, safe and more-affordable locally grown food choices. The industry has indeed grown and, as recently announced, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment has responded to requests for increased financial supports for large-scale development on established and growing commercial farm businesses. Three significant investments were made this winter in farms in the Hay River area under the federal Canadian Agriculture Partnership.  We continue to take stock of the progress that is being made by farmers and harvesters in order to determine what investments and initiatives are needed to continue the evolution and growth in our territory’s emerging agriculture sector.   Mr. Speaker, our government’s first agriculture strategy was introduced as a means to advance regional economic development and diversification; but we also recognize that our agriculture sector can do much more than diversify and strengthen our economy.  Our government’s mandate includes a commitment to increase food security through locally produced, harvested, and affordable food.  The growth of our agriculture sector is central to this commitment, and for the past year, the COVID pandemic has brought it to the forefront.  Food security is an issue that impacts everybody in the territory and for too many of our residents, touches every aspect of their lives, particularly affecting health, and education outcomes. It is an issue that rightfully is now commanding a collaborative all-of- government approach.   While this work is being led by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment, we are reliant on support from the Departments of Health and Social Services, Environment and Natural Resources and Lands, as well as our ongoing partnership with the Government of Canada.   The Department has been working with these partner departments to consider how the GNWT can better support food security efforts across the territory.  In doing this, the Department has compiled an inventory of GNWT food security programming and develop a set of considerations to assist the GWNT in making meaningful progress on food security, and Health and Social Services lead an anti-poverty roundtable meeting focused on food security. All of these pieces will come together under a single document that we are currently drafting.  Canada’s Agriculture Day is an opportunity to celebrate the growth of this industry over the last few years including initiatives by producers to adapt their businesses to the pandemic. It is also a chance to highlight the rising interest across the NWT to think creatively about local food production such as shown at farmers markets, community greenhouses, and especially our small and vibrant community of commercial growers and food producers. Together, these efforts support the commitment that our government has made to addressing food security.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
140,2021-03-29,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-community-housing-support-program,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Community Housing Support Program,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, throughout the life of this government, I have travelled to many communities and it cannot go unnoticed that every community in the Northwest Territories is unique and has different needs. With 33 unique communities in the NWT, flexible programming is needed to ensure community needs are being met. The NWT Housing Corporation has a program to support Indigenous governments and community agencies to develop innovative, community-driven housing projects of their own design. The Community Housing Support Program works to ensure that local priorities around housing and homelessness can be met with a variety of support options. Mr. Speaker, flexibility really is key with this program. The Housing Corporation, under this program, offers support through grants and other contributions. Support may be in the form of policy and program design, material packages, technical expertise, land management, or surplus units when appropriate. Mr. Speaker, at this time the Community Housing Support Program is supporting projects in eight communities across the NWT. In Fort Smith, the Housing Corporation has completed a project with the Salt River First Nation that has led to the creation of six new affordable housing units. In this case, the Housing Corporation provided the materials and the Salt River First Nation provided the land and labour. In both Whatı̀ and Jean Marie River, similar projects were completed. Two new units were constructed in each community, with the Housing Corporation providing a contribution for the construction. Mr. Speaker, in Nahanni Butte and Fort Good Hope the Community Housing Support Program has been used to create community-driven housing repair programs.  Through these community-managed repair programs, communities prioritize the residents that they think are most in need of repairs.  Funding allows them to inspect houses, create scopes of work, purchase materials and hire local tradespeople and apprentices to conduct the work. In Colville Lake the community expressed interest in log homes, so the Housing Corporation is working on a log home demonstration project in the community. The project proposes the construction of four log homes in Colville Lake, constructed with funding from the Housing Corporation. The community will supply the logs and will coordinate the design, land development, and construction. Mr. Speaker, working in partnership with Indigenous governments and community agencies is a priority of this government. Partnerships like those supported by the Community Housing Support Program are critical to making sure the Housing Corporation is working to meet the needs identified by the communities themselves.  The program dovetails perfectly with supporting communities to identify their housing priorities through the establishment of community housing plans.  The Community Housing Support Program is a key tool in supporting communities to address their housing aspirations. I am looking forward to seeing the results of these partnerships and what the next innovative, locally driven projects are that grow from this initiative.  Mahsi, Mr. Speaker."

Simpson, to discuss their joint work to further strengthen the territory’s Junior Kindergarten (JK) to Grade 12 education system.  Education leaders meet multiple times a year to review current work and to plan for future initiatives in NWT education. Minister Simpson opened the virtual meeting today by expressing his sincere appreciation for the strength of the relationships among elected education leaders across the territory. Such strong relationships have been essential and supportive to the urgent work completed during the pandemic to safely and successfully re-open and sustain JK to 12 education operations for students, teachers, and families across the territory.  As key stakeholders in all matters of education change and renewal, education leaders participated in an initial engagement presentation and discussion regarding the Education Act Modernization (EAM). This presentation centered on a review of the four major components of the discussion paper on EAM, specifically: education system and structure; language and culture; education program; and education staff. Education leaders also reviewed initial research findings on the renewal of JK-12 curriculum. This engagement work will actively involve Indigenous Governments and stakeholder groups. Such significant work will strengthen NWT education and modernize its curriculum, ensuring it aligns with the NWT’s priorities and values for education. The meeting concluded with both Minister Simpson and Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, thanking all education leaders for their time, input, and questions during the productive meeting. The next meeting of education leaders with Minister Simpson is scheduled for Tuesday, April 27, 2021. Quick facts: The GNWT is working to modernize the Education Act in an effort to increase student outcomes to the same level as the rest of Canada, and to close the gap in student outcomes that exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, and between students in Yellowknife and smaller communities. ECE regularly reviews its curriculum and resources to ensure they align with the NWT’s priorities and values for education. The NWT currently uses a mix of curriculum that is either adapted or adopted from other jurisdictions in Canada, or is created in the NWT for JK-12. Much of the NWT curriculum is Alberta’s, especially at the high school level, though ECE also draws on parts of its curriculum from other Western Canadian provinces.

Quotes “I am pleased with the important and productive discussions we had today with education leaders across the territory as we continue working towards equitable education for all students of the NWT. The changes we make together to the Education Act and our JK-12 curriculum are vital to the strength and future of education in the territory.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “All NWT education leaders thank their district and school staff for their dedication in safely and successfully reopening schools and ensuring JK-12 education operations throughout the pandemic.  The education leaders are also actively engaged in the Education Act modernization, and in the JK-12 curriculum renewal work, to ensure it reflects NWT priorities and values for education.  This important work will have a positive outcome on education in the NWT for years to come.” -Simon Cloutier, Chair, Commission scolaire francophone Territoires du Nord-Ouest   For more information contact: Simon Cloutier Commission scolaire francophone Territoires du Nord-Ouest simon.cloutier@csftno.com   Christina Carrigan Manager, Communications and Public Affairs Department of Education, Culture and Employment christina_carrigan@gov.nt.ca"

This change will stay in effect until July 31, 2021. The Departments of Finance and Industry, Tourism, and Investment (ITI) are implementing this short-term procurement policy change in response to feedback received from business development staff on-the-ground in communities and the NWT business community. The change is part of GWNT efforts to ensure that more northern businesses have a fair and equal opportunity to compete for GNWT contracts by increasing transparency, and awareness of government procurement opportunities. To that end, this change will be evaluated and assessed – along with all other existing procurement policies – as part of the current GNWT procurement and contracting review.  Under this temporary change, all GNWT purchasing above $10,000 will now go through the formal GNWT public procurement process. GNWT departments or employees seeking goods and services estimated to be $10,000 and over will use a public competitive procurement request such as a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a tender. Purchases of General Goods and Services under $10,000 will continue to follow the order/hierarchy for purchasing: Local BIP Registered Businesses (first priority) NWT, BIP Registered Business (second priority) Local businesses (third priority) NWT businesses (fourth priority) Non-NWT based businesses (fifth priority) The process and limits for professional, architectural, and engineering services are unchanged.

Both now and into the future?   We want to hear your thoughts for how best to recruit a new generation of interpreters and translators into this field. These roles are critical in ensuring our Indigenous language and culture revitalization efforts are successful.   We need your guidance and insight to make sure we’re supporting career opportunities for current and future language speakers.   Over the next two days, ECE staff will also update you on the work they’re already involved in that supports the revitalization of our Indigenous languages, including how to ensure interpreting and translating is both a viable and attractive career options for future generations of NWT language speakers.    The NWT Indigenous Languages Action Plan lays out two goals: language revitalization and language access. Interpreters and translators play a foundational role in the GNWT’s obligation to provide communications and services in Indigenous languages, and I recognize that we can’t do this work without you.   Thank you / Masi for taking the time to log on to Zoom and participate virtually in this gathering.

Based on current data, flow rates on the Slave, Tazin and Taltson Rivers, along with water levels in the Great Slave Lake are very high for this time of year. Because conditions are unprecedented, it is difficult to predict exactly what will happen this spring. Local conditions will depend on: The timing and volume of precipitation (i.e. snow and rain); Thickness of river and lake ice; and The timing and rate of spring melt. The GNWT is advising anyone with property close to rivers, lakes and streams across the NWT to take steps now to prepare for potential flooding events this spring that could impact cabins and other property along the rivers, deltas and the Great Slave Lake shoreline. Existing winter water level and flow data in the Great Slave Lake basin suggests that the unprecedented high water is expected to continue, particularly in the South Slave region.  The GNWT will continue to monitor water levels throughout the NWT and update the public as new information develops.  Steps to prepare your home or cabin for a flood include: Moving valuables and equipment to a safe place. Removing or elevating electrical components. Removing or elevating carpets, furniture and mattresses. Real-time water level and flow data for rivers and lakes in the NWT can be found on Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Website.   Media Requests, please contact: Jaimee Kepa Communications Planning Specialist Environment and Natural Resources Government of the Northwest Territories Jaimee_kepa@gov.nt.ca 867-767-9231, ext. 53045"

The Liquor Legislation Review (Review) began in July 2020 with a research phase and an objective of ensuring the legislation is more modern, streamlined and responsive to the needs of NWT residents. The next phase of the Review is this engagement. During the Review, the GNWT will consider how to improve liquor legislation related to the possession, consumption, sale, purchase, manufacture, importation and distribution of liquor in the NWT. Background research has been completed and the Department is moving forward with public engagement starting this month. The GNWT is committed to providing governments, organizations, those who work directly with liquor and all residents with opportunities to participate in the review. A full schedule of planned engagement sessions is available through the Department of Finance website at https://www.fin.gov.nt.ca/en. Those interested in participating in the Review are also encouraged to complete an online survey which can be found at Online survey. All engagement activities for the Review will close on June 30, 2021. Quote “The current liquor legislation was introduced in 2008. Since then, numerous amendments have been introduced to try to keep up with evolving community needs, business methods and technology. It is time to look at the legislation as a whole to make it more consistent, modern and responsive.  -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance Quick facts The Liquor Legislation Review will consider how to improve the NWT’s liquor laws related to: possession; consumption; sale and purchase; manufacture; importation; and distribution of liquor in the NWT. The Review will not look for solutions to liquor-related issues over which NWT liquor legislation does not have authority (e.g. addictions treatment and impaired driving). Such issues are governed by other legislation, or they intentionally rest outside legislation. The GNWT will engage with governments, organizations, industry and the public in a variety of ways.  Full details about the engagement are available at the Department of Finance website.

This new priority group began receiving vaccines on Friday, March 12, 2021. Included in this priority group are workers at Imperial Oil in Norman Wells, as well as mines operated by Rio Tinto (Diavik), Dominion (Ekati), and De Beers (Gahcho Kué). Other non-resident rotational workers will continue to be considered by the CPHO on a case-by-case basis. Increasing immunity at these worksites will protect residents, their families, and the communities NWT residents return to between shifts - particularly the most remote and vulnerable communities with limited access to health care. Every dose given in the NWT will continue to boost the territory’s overall defense against COVID-19. The decision to vaccinate non-resident rotational workers is supported by the federal government and is occurring in other jurisdictions across Canada reliant on transitional workers to deliver essential services. Recent remote worksite outbreaks in the NWT and the development of new COVID-19 variants in other parts of Canada have highlighted the importance of protecting rotational workers living and working inside our borders. The NWT is ahead of schedule offering first doses to residents aged 18 years of age and older in all 33 NWT communities. Plans to vaccinate non-resident rotational workers will not prevent NWT residents from getting their promised doses of vaccine. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) has requested 12,000 additional doses from the federal government specifically for non-resident workers over and above the original allotment of 51,600 doses. Any NWT resident rotational workers who may have missed getting a dose in their home community will also be offered the vaccine if/when the NWT vaccination team visits their worksite. With the arrival of the fifth shipment of vaccine expected next week, the NWT is well-positioned to provide both doses of the vaccine to 75% of its adult population by the end of April 2021. The GNWT will not incur any additional costs associated with vaccinating non-resident rotational workers. Quote “We’ve said since the beginning that non-resident workers not included in our initial priority groups are invited to email the CPHO to ask for an individual exemption. Though this still remains an option, I am glad to see that these large worksites have been added to the priority list which will ensure additional safety for NWT residents and communities.” -Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick Facts: Non-residents workers working at the sites indicated above have/will receive notification about vaccine dates/times through their employer. To date the NWT has received four shipments of the Moderna vaccine, totalling 35,300 doses. Every resident over the age of 18, in all 33 communities across the NWT is now being offered the COVID-19 vaccine. The NWT vaccine schedule can be found by visiting www.nthssa.ca/covid-vaccine.

Moss balls, often sold as Marimo moss balls, are green algae commonly used to increase water quality in aquariums.  The GNWT was alerted to the presence of invasive mussels found in moss balls sold in the NWT.  Immediate action is required to prevent the potential introduction of this dangerous invader.  Background on Invasive Mussel Species There are two types of closely-related mussels that the NWT is concerned about: zebra mussels and quagga mussels Zebra and quagga mussels are small freshwater mussels. While they can only grow as large as a thumbnail, they have the potential to cause big damage to the NWT’s biodiversity, aquatic ecosystems, fish populations, hydro power stations and other infrastructure.  They multiply fast and are virtually impossible to eradicate from an area once they are introduced.  How to stop introduction to the environment If residents have purchased any moss balls in the last year, the best thing to do is destroy them immediately, and decontaminate the aquariums in which they were used.  Here’s how to do it safely and effectively: Place the moss ball into a sealed plastic bag and freeze for at least 24 hours, OR place the moss ball in boiling water for at least one full minute. After this, place the moss ball and any of its packaging in a sealed plastic bag and dispose in the trash. Do not flush moss balls down the toilet or dispose of them in the compost.  Never dump aquarium tank pets, plants or untreated water down the drain or into any residential water system or waterway. Treat any water removed from the aquarium before disposing of it.  The tank and all accessories (e.g. rocks, decorations, etc.) should be washed with a strong solution of chlorine bleach and water. Alternately, careful use of boiling water may also be effective. Complete decontamination guidelines can be found here.  Anyone who finds zebra mussels can call their local or regional ENR office or send an email to wildlifeobs@gov.nt.ca.   Related Link:  Fisheries and Oceans Canada – Invasive Mussels Found in Moss Ball Products Media Requests, please contact:  Mike Westwick Manager, Communications and Public Affairs Environment and Natural ResourcesGovernment of the Northwest Territories Mike_Westwick@gov.nt.ca 1-867-765-8557 "
162,2021-03-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-rolling-action-nwt-film-and-media,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Rolling - Action! NWT Film and Media,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, while 2020 was a very different year for film and media in the Northwest Territories, we have continued to work behind the scenes to ensure we are supporting the sector so they are ready to welcome new opportunities when border restrictions are eased. As we all know, the pandemic has impacted economic and social sectors around the world. The NWT film and media sector was no exception. Several guest film companies postponed their productions as a result of border restrictions. Since that time, the NWT Film Commission has worked with stakeholders to look for innovative ways to support the industry with a focus on future development.  For example, the Film Commission offered support through the territorial Creative Industries Economic Recovery Fund, providing $341,873 for both film and arts related projects. It supported Western Arctic Moving Pictures to present a Virtual Film Production Script-to-Screen Training Series delivered by established NWT film producers at the 13th Annual Virtual Yellowknife International Film Festival. Members from the Professional Media Association received complimentary festival passes to attend the virtual 2020 Banff Media Festival and Whistler Film Festival and Summit; and were also supported to deliver a virtual screenwriting workshop to its members led by a professional screenwriter based in Los Angeles.  As well, the Film Rebate Program, begun in 2015, has committed approximately $511,000 to 14 productions, leveraging an additional $5 million in funding into the NWT. To date, the total direct NWT spend is approximately $5.5 million.  Supporting this sector is something that our government remains committed to, especially as we look at post-COVID-19 recovery. The film industry is an important driver of both economic activity and cultural development. According to the most recent 2019 report from the national Culture Satellite Account, film and associated activities contribute $9.27 million to the NWT’s gross domestic product, $15.5 million to the NWT’s economic output, and supports 58 jobs. Less tangibly, but perhaps more important, home-grown films help tell and show stories of the land and people of the Northwest Territories.  Mr. Speaker, while we will still face challenges associated with the pandemic for the foreseeable future, we are also preparing for the easing of border and travel restrictions. The first NWT Film Strategy, Take One, was focused on growth, for in-territory productions and creating partnerships out-of-territory. Over the past 10 years, the film and media sector has grown substantially and is now in the position of leveraging partnerships toward greater projects and opportunities.  Over the past year, the Let’s Talk Film and Media campaign was launched to gather feedback on the next phase of film and media growth. We engaged community leaders, municipalities, and stakeholders across the North for their input.  The result is Rolling, Action: The Next Five Years, the Film and Media Sector Strategy and Action Plan, currently being finalized for launch this spring. The focus to 2026 is continued growth, with an emphasis on becoming nationally competitive and solidifying a sustainable industry in the NWT. The Strategy and Action Plan will demonstrate our government’s commitment to further develop the film and media sector, market and promote productions made in the NWT, attract commercial productions from outside the NWT and build the capacity of the local industry and organizations. This is only a teaser: an announcement on the first initiative from the new Strategy, will be made this spring.  Mr. Speaker, as we look to what we will do to support this sector, it is also important to recognize the achievements we have made to this point. Last evening was a celebration marking the 10th formal year of the Northwest Territories Film and Media Sector.  The NWT Film Commission hosted, what I note was a COVID-directive compliant event, with sector stakeholders from across the territory. To commemorate 10 years of film in the NWT, milestone awards were presented to some of the groups and partners that have helped to grow the film and media sector.  Representatives from the Inuvialuit Communications Society, the Native Communications Society, the NWT Professional Media Association, Western Arctic Moving Pictures, and the Dead North Film Festival accepted awards for their contributions to northern film and media. Of special note I will highlight the work of Artless Collective’s Pablo Saravanja and Jay Bulckaert on the Dead North Film Festival. Since 2012, this homegrown festival has encouraged hundreds of film teams of all ages and experience to participate. Over the last nine years, more than 220 films were produced and showcased at the festival. Some went beyond, to other festivals and screenings, with others leading to feature projects or earning a screen in world-renowned film festivals. The NWT Film Commission in the Department of Industry, Tourism, and Investment has been a supporter and sponsor of the festival from its outset.  One of the key pieces of Dead North has been the industry training and workshops afforded to participants, at which the writers and producers of the films received tips and feedback from more experienced professionals in the industry. This component of the festival marks a true investment in not only the film and media sector, but in the people working to expand and grow NWT film into a significant contributor of the northern economy. Congratulations to all of last night’s recipients.  Thank you for your dedication to the growing film and media sector in the NWT.  Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories recognizes the economic and cultural benefits of developing the NWT film and media sector by supporting local capacity building, promoting made-in-the-NWT film projects, and attracting commercial productions from outside the NWT. These actions contribute to the mandate commitment of increasing economic diversification by supporting growth in non-extractive sectors and setting regional diversification targets. ITI continues to promote investments and unique opportunities in the film and media sector, recognizing not only the benefits it generates across other sectors of the NWT economy, but the importance of continuing to celebrate industry and partner  achievements over the next 10 years.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
163,2021-03-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-respectful-caribou-hunting,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Respectful Caribou Hunting,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, caribou have sustained generations of Northerners across the Northwest Territories.    They are deeply tied to the NWT’s society and culture. Communities have always relied on them for food, hides and traditional practices.    But today, some herds have seen major declines. They continue to face challenges including climate change, habitat change, predators and human activity.                                                      Illegal and disrespectful hunting practices are also real concerns.     Our government continues to work with Indigenous governments and organizations, and other co-management partners to put rules in place to protect the herds and support recovery and has done so for decades.    We continue to work with our partners to support people in following traditional harvesting practices and showing respect for caribou.    But there is still a problem.    We see it on-the-ground and from the air as officers patrol for illegal hunting, wastage, and garbage left on-the-land.      We hear it from Indigenous governments and organizations when they tell us traditional practices are being broken by people looking to sell harvested caribou for profit, which is also against the Wildlife Act.   And we feel it when fellow hunters share stories and images of wounded animals left un-harvested and suffering by others.    Mr. Speaker, while most hunters do things the right way, we continue to see others who haven’t this year.    We have documented more than 50 instances of illegal hunting in the no-harvest zone to protect the Bathurst Herd, and many cases of meat wastage across the winter road this season. That is much higher than this point last year.    These actions have real consequences, and I do not just mean charges.    Every illegally hunted animal hurts efforts towards recovery of the Bathurst Herd.     Every piece of meat wasted means families and communities do not get the most out of the harvest.    Every time people take more than they need, they put herds at risk and set back shared efforts towards recovery.    Mr. Speaker, when I talk to Elders and leaders, there is a real fear that these practices are pushing us towards a future no one wants to see: one where caribou aren’t there; one where their children do not get to bring meat home for their kids.    Our government is listening. We are working with Indigenous governments and organizations. We are taking action as partners so future generations will be able to harvest.    We have increased the enforcement presence along the winter road by truck, snow machine, and helicopter. We are looking out for illegal meat sales online and in our communities. We are asking people to follow the law and laying charges against those who do not.    We are supporting our wolf harvesters and the NWT’s traditional economy to help reduce the impact wolves have on our caribou herds; and we are working with co-management partners to continuously improve our wolf management efforts.    We are working with governments and organizations spanning the NWT, Nunavut, and two provinces on management plans with real action to move threatened caribou herds towards recovery.    We are investing in programs to increase harvesting knowledge across our territory like hunter education, take a family trapping, and site-in-your rifle events.    And we are targeting our communication and outreach to change behaviours – bringing voices together from our communities, Elders and leaders to join the effort.    But Mr. Speaker, regulations and plans alone aren’t going to get us to recovery.    It also comes down to individuals making good decisions.    So please, if you are exercising your right to hunt or harvest, remember:    Do not harvest any caribou where you aren’t allowed to – including the Mobile Zone;  Use everything from the animals you harvest; Take bulls to protect future generations of the herd; Harvest only what you need; and,  Respect the land and water while you are out there.    Make these choices today so future generations can choose to harvest.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   "
164,2021-03-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-intergovernmental-council-legislative-development-protocol,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Intergovernmental Council Legislative Development Protocol,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, a fundamental part of our success as a government, and the future prosperity of our territory, depends on a productive and collaborative partnership with Indigenous governments. We must foster constructive and respective relationships with our Indigenous leaders, and to seek ways to advance reconciliation, recognize and affirm Indigenous rights, and support expanded program and service delivery.  It gives me great pleasure, to update Members of the 19th Legislative Assembly on the Intergovernmental Council’s recent adoption of the Legislative Development Protocol for lands and resources legislation. In 2014, the Government of the Northwest Territories committed to working collaboratively with our Devolution partners to review and develop any proposed changes, including legislative changes, to our land and resource management systems. The Northwest Territories Intergovernmental Agreement on Lands and Resource Management is an important part of this commitment, and our work through the Intergovernmental Council shows how we can work together while also recognizing the rights, jurisdiction and authority of each individual Council member.    Mr. Speaker, the Legislative Development Protocol was adopted by the Intergovernmental Council on December 2, 2020, and provides for the collaborative development of lands and resource legislation. Consistent with the Northwest Territories Intergovernmental Agreement on Lands and Resources Management, the protocol respects the jurisdictions and authorities of Indigenous governments and the GNWT and preserves the important role of the elected leaders while also providing a mechanism for collaboration and consensus-building. The protocol is the first agreement of its kind in Canada and supports the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by respecting, consulting and collaborating with Indigenous governments on land and resource management. The Intergovernmental Council’s shared commitment to work together has been a hallmark of the GNWT approach to the devolution of land and resource management in 2014. The Protocol is a step toward realizing the mutual promises we made with our devolution partners. The Protocol also supports this governments ongoing efforts to collaborate with Indigenous Governments to meet mandate priorities, including the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  The Protocol has already attracted positive attention from other parts of Canada and reinforces this governments reputation as a nation-wide leader in this area.   Make no mistake there will still be times when unanimous agreement cannot be reached at the Intergovernmental Council. The Protocol recognizes that unanimity is not required, and decisions that balance different interests will still be required as the GNWT’s legislation is developed. Further, to help promote harmonization and collaboration, the Protocol provides a mechanism for notification of Indigenous governments’ own legislation respecting lands and resources.  I would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues on the Intergovernmental Council for their commitment and collaborative spirit, and congratulate them all by recognizing each member government and their officials for this historic undertaking. The members of the Intergovernmental Council along with the Government of the Northwest Territories include: • Acho Dene Koe First Nation; • Denı́nu Kú ̨ ę́ First Nation; • Gwich’in Tribal Council; • Inuvialuit Regional Corporation; • Kátł’odeeche First Nation; • Northwest Territory Métis Nation; • Sahtu Secretariat Incorporated; • Salt River First Nation, and; • the Tłı̨chǫ Government. The promise of devolution included a commitment to work collaboratively as governments on the management of lands and resources in the NWT. The members of the Intergovernmental Council are delivering on this promise.  The Protocol will result in stronger and more effective land and resource management legislation. It will also better position the GNWT to collaborate on any new legislative authority it obtains through ongoing discussions to bring elements of the Mackenzie Valley Resource Mangement Act home to the NWT. For Indigenous Governments that are not yet members of the Intergovernmental Council, we will continue to consult and engage to ensure that there they also have opportunity to provide input the development of lands and resources legislation. I will also continue to invite Indigenous Governments not yet partners in devolution to join, and work directly through the Intergovernmental Council. I look forward to working together with the Intergovernmental Council to make decisions for the responsible and sustainable management of lands, waters and natural resources of the Northwest Territories for the benefit of current and future generations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
165,2021-03-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-archie-improvements-driver-and-vehicle-services,Government Website,Diane Archie: Improvements to Driver and Vehicle Services ,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories understands how important it is for residents to have reliable and efficient access to driver and vehicle services. For this reason, we are committed to delivering and improving these services for the public, even during a global pandemic.  I would like to thank the employees working at driver and vehicle offices across the territory, including our regional contractors and online support staff.  The GNWT knows that our residents need to have access to services. Because of the pandemic, Driver and Motor Vehicle office, or DMV, have had to change how they operate. To ensure the safety of our staff and the public, our offices were closed from March to July, 2020. DMV employees and contractors had to quickly adapt to accommodate the public by phone and email. Once reopened to the public, our offices had to implement new health and safety measures, which impacted capacity in waiting areas. Despite these challenges, this past year our government has provided almost 63 thousand in-person service requests and over 68 thousand online service transactions across the territory. These services included issuing new driver’s licence and general identification cards, providing residents with driver abstracts, updating and renewing existing licences, and registering vehicles.   Mr. Speaker, we do recognize the need to improve further. We have heard some concerns, particularly from Yellowknife residents around the booking process for in-person visits to our issuing office. We value feedback from the public and are always looking for ways to improve our customer service delivery. That is why the Yellowknife DMV office is distributing anonymous exit surveys to clients, asking them to share their thoughts around the GNWT’s booking process. These surveys will help guide decision-making around client service processes in the future. On the digital side of things, work is underway to improve the driver and vehicle website, also known as iDMV. The iDMV provides residents with several online services, such as renewing a driver’s licence or vehicle registration. While this website has been very useful for residents, we have also heard from many people about how challenging it can be to use at times. We hear and value your feedback, and are committed to doing better. Clients can expect an improved, more user-friendly iDMV web experience in the coming months.  Mr. Speaker, one of our core functions are issuing driver’s licenses and general identification cards. This past year we have made some exciting upgrades to these documents. The new cards offer improved security features, meaning they are more difficult to alter or replicate, keep unlicensed and suspended drivers off the road and protect residents from fraud. We also introduced facial recognition technology. Images for driver’s licences and general identification cards that are taken at driver and vehicle offices will be used for the facial recognition system. This will provide residents with greater protection from identity theft and make it even harder to obtain driver’s licenses when banned from driving in another jurisdiction.  Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories will continue to prioritize resident safety, while delivering driver and vehicle services to residents across the territory. We will continue to listen to our clients’ feedback so that we can improve on the delivery of these important services.   Quyanainni, Mr. Speaker."

The minimum wage rate in the NWT was last increased in 2018 and was set at a rate of $13.46 per hour. Since that time, the cost of living and the average hourly wage in the NWT have risen and minimum wage earners have fallen behind. With the rate change, the Northwest Territories will now have the second highest minimum wage in Canada, after Nunavut. Quote “The GNWT is committed to striking a balance between maintaining fair and competitive wage rates while encouraging economic activity and supporting small businesses. By providing workers across the territory with a minimum wage more suitable to the cost of living, and businesses the option to attract more workers for minimum wage positions - I am confident that this increase will benefit both NWT workers and businesses.” - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment Quick facts The minimum wage was last increased in 2018. Since that time, the cost of living and the average hourly wage have risen. In 2013, the Minister of Education, Culture and Employment appointed a Minimum Wage Committee comprised of representatives from business, labour and community organizations across the territory. To ensure the NWT’s minimum wage continues to work for employees and employers, the minimum wage rate is reviewed every two years.

168,2021-03-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-minimum-wage-increase,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Minimum Wage Increase,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, on September 1, 2021 the minimum wage in the Northwest Territories will increase from $13.46 per hour to $15.20 per hour, making it the second highest minimum wage in Canada behind Nunavut. Since the last increase in 2018, the cost of living and the average hourly wage in the NWT have risen. This increase ensures that the minimum wage does not fall behind, brings our minimum to average wage ratio more in line with the rest of Canada, and makes us more competitive with our neighbouring jurisdictions. Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories is very aware of the ongoing impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on employees and businesses. That is why this government has provided a number of supports since the onset of the pandemic, including the NWT Wage Top-Up Program, which has been extended until August 31, 2021; the extension of Business Development and Investment Corporation working capital loans and deferred loan payments; financial supports for the arts and agriculture sectors; and the Support for Entrepreneurs and Economic Development program, which was adapted to the realities of the pandemic. We also understand the importance of providing employers with sufficient time to plan for and implement a new minimum wage, which is why we are making this announcement now and will continue to advertise this change until it comes into effect on September 1, 2021. The Department of Education, Culture and Employment also recently announced new Labour Market Recovery Program funding, which will provide critical support to businesses looking to re-hire workers, prevent further job losses, return to or transition operations, or develop training and capacity. This recovery funding is available to employers, organizations and community partners by contacting regional Education, Culture and Employment service centres. The decision to increase the minimum wage to $15.20 per hour was informed by the recommendations of the Minimum Wage Committee. To ensure that the views of employees and employers are reflected in decisions about the minimum wage, a Minimum Wage Committee is struck every two years and includes representatives from industry, labour and non-governmental organizations. Committee members work collaboratively to identify options for minimum wage rates that are considered fair for both employees and employers. In developing their recommendations, the Committee undertook extensive research on the social and economic conditions of the Northwest Territories, minimum and average hourly wages in other provinces and territories, and the findings of national and international reports and studies. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Committee members for the time, energy, and thoughtful consideration and analysis they put into developing their report and recommendations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
169,2021-03-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-long-term-care-bed-projections,Government Website,Julie Green: Long-Term Care Bed Projections,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories knows how important it is to enable Seniors to age in place with dignity as loved and valued members of our communities. That is why the 19th Legislative Assembly has identified this as one of the 22 priorities in the Mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories.  We are taking a whole-of-government approach to create the conditions in which Seniors will be able to stay at home as they age. Mr. Speaker, one way the Department of Health and Social Services is working to achieve this mandate priority is by implementing recommendations from the Home and Community Care Review. We want to support Seniors to remain living independently with services such as nursing care, personal care like bathing and dressing, and home support for meals and laundry. While we focus on improving home and community care services, we know that not everyone’s care needs can be met in the community, particularly those with complex conditions and those who need care throughout the day and night.  For this reason, the Department is also providing equitable access to high quality long-term care services to support Seniors. Mr. Speaker, back in 2015, the GNWT provided an estimate of how many long-term care beds we would need in future years. At that time we had only five years of long-term care data and used a ratio-based model. Last summer, the Department decided to update these numbers. Staff worked with the NWT Bureau of Statistics to redo the estimate of long-term care beds required over the next 14 years. Later today, I will be tabling the result, a report titled, Projected Demand for Long-Term Care Beds in the NWT and the Department’s Response to Long-Term Care Bed Projections. The summary of the report tells us we will not require as many new beds as we thought in 2015. The NWT Bureau of Statistics used the most current and best practices to establish the demand for care. The Bureau used 10 years of NWT long-term care data for its modelling and provided the Department with projections for three scenarios based on age and care needs. The projections for all three indicate the same thing; the number of beds needed has decreased. The Department of Health and Social Services has accepted one of these scenarios. We are confident that these projections are based on the best evidence available. These projections align with key findings about long-term care use in the NWT, such as our average age of admission into long-term care, and the care levels individuals require upon admission. To make a long story short, we will need an additional 169 long-term care beds by 2034. This is a reduction from the 2015 bed projections that identified we would need 435 additional beds in the same time frame. These updated projections are based on a model that is aligned with best practices used by other jurisdictions. The NWT Bureau of Statistics used 10 years of the Department’s Long term care data and regional and territorial population projections to provide the new long term care bed projections up to 2035. Our projections now tell us the NWT’s long term care bed use is 72 per1000 population age 70 and older, as compared to the 115per 1000 population age 70 and older used for the 2015 projections. This is one of the biggest contributors to the adjustment in the 2020 bed projections.  We have also added additional long term beds in Norman Wells and Behchoko since the projections were done in 2015. The revised bed projections will not result in a reduction of services for seniors.  We will use our home and community care resources more effectively. This means that seniors will receive the support they need in their home communities for as long as possible without going into long term care. Long term care is meant for seniors who require high levels of care, and that can no longer be supported in their homes. Examples of this include medically complex diagnoses, a person who requires 24/7 care, and a person who is at high risk of injury to self or others. Seniors will be supported by the whole of government, which includes targeted investment in other areas including additional seniors housing. Mr. Speaker, this is a dramatic change and these new long-term care bed projections will require a shift in the Department’s current plans for capital spending in several NWT communities. The Department plans to discuss these changes with stakeholders. We want to determine the best approach to provide an evidence-based continuum of services to meet the care needs of Seniors, including Home Care, Long-Term Care and other innovative approaches. Through initial engagement with Indigenous governments and health and social services system leaders, we have confirmed the desire to have Elders and their caregivers supported to remain living in their home.  The Department will continue to work collaboratively to respond. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Health and Social Services is committed to enhancing Home and Community Care services to more fully meet the care needs of Seniors and Elders so they can remain independent as long as possible, and ensuring long-term care services are in place when their needs can no longer be met in their community. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
170,2021-03-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-covid-19-community-planning,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: COVID-19 Community Planning,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, Northwest Territories, or NWT residents are no strangers to emergency 	events.  Every year we are faced with threats such as forest fires, floods, and prolonged winter power outages to name a few. Over the past 10 years alone we have seen 	21 emergency events that have resulted in the activation of community and territorial emergency plans and in some cases those events led to community evacuations. 	These events have included wildfires, floods, severe weather, prolonged power outages and fuel shortages. 	The approach to emergency management in the NWT relies on participation from everyone, individuals, families and to all levels of government. We are all in this together. Individuals and families have a responsibility to plan and prepare for the risks most relevant to them, to ensure their safety and the protection of their property. Communities are responsible for the development and implementation of emergency plans to reasonably protect the general public and minimize property damage and loss during emergencies. The Government of the Northwest Territories is responsible for planning and responding to territorial emergencies and supporting communities when their capacity is exceeded during emergencies. Since March 2020, NWT residents have been faced with a new threat unlike any we have experienced before; the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic response is being led by Health and Social Services and is supported by the COVID Secretariat as well as Municipal and Community Affairs, or MACA. MACA’s primary focus during this event has included: supporting the GNWT’s pandemic response, working with communities to ensure planning and preparedness at the community level, and monitoring for any other emergency events. MACA works with all departments through the Emergency Management Organization, or EMO, and to provide needed support to communities. Mr. Speaker, one of the key success factors in past emergencies has been the ability of our communities to plan and prepare, and when required, respond to protect and care for our residents.   As we found ourselves in the COVID-19 pandemic, very few community plans included guidelines on how to respond to a threat.  As a result, since early in the pandemic, MACA has been working with all communities to ensure there is a good understanding of the potential threats and their requirements to sustain essential services. Communities have been working very hard to ensure they have plans in place, identified potential gaps in services, and that preparations were being made. Mr. Speaker, the true value of planning and preparedness is not realized until an emergency happens. The community of Fort Liard is an excellent example and the first real test of a community emergency plan to the direct impacts of a pandemic. On January 16, 2021, when the first case of COVID was confirmed in Fort Liard these emergency plans were implemented which meant activating local officials. The Dehcho Regional EMO was also activated and deployed an on-site coordinator to Fort Liard daily to support the community government who advised as to their limitations in capacity in some areas. Staff also provided support for daily meetings with community leadership and ensured integration of EMO efforts with various people and groups. While community resources and capacity were impacted by the incident, the community was able, with support from the Emergency Management Organization to respond and ensure all essential services continued. These efforts also meant that those required to self-isolate had access to groceries and other essential items. We want to commend the community for pulling together to ensure that all residents had their basic needs supported during the response.  Mr. Speaker, planning for and responding to emergency events is an ongoing process and the COVID-19 Pandemic is unprecedented. MACA will continue to work with communities to ensure plans are adapted and adjusted as more is learned about the COVID-19 virus, as the risk environment and assessment evolves, as vaccine programs take effect and as we learn from experiences like the recent response in Fort Liard. Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 has been a long and difficult road for everyone. The roll-out of the vaccine in the NWT is being well received. It is important to note that the situation in the rest of Canada shows that we need to remain vigilant.  I would like to remind everyone that it is 	critical that we all remain focused on protecting one another on behalf of Cabinet and I would like to thank all residents who continue to follow the advice and direction given by the Chief Public Health Officer, and to ensure their own personal preparedness. Develop personal emergency plans, have emergency supplies on hand, and connect with friends, family, and neighbours to support each other. A simple phone call or offer to drop off groceries at the doorstep can make a huge difference for anyone in self-isolation or feeling vulnerable. 	Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Within days, the people of the world were at a standstill – and were faced with one of the biggest, and most unique challenges of their lives. In the past year, 116 million people worldwide have contracted the virus, and 2.6 million people have lost their lives to COVID-19. Our hearts are with those who have passed away, and the families, friends, and loved ones they left behind. The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened our health, impacted our economic well-being, and disconnected us from the support networks we rely on most in our lives, and put to test our mental health as we tried our best to navigate the unchartered waters of a modern-day pandemic. It put to test the resiliency of Northerners. And one year later, we are beginning to see past the pandemic to our social and economic recovery. Our collective success is a result of the hard work, sacrifice, and dedication of so many. The partnership and collaborative spirit between federal, territorial, Indigenous, and community leaders exemplifies the strength and resilience that underpins what the Northwest Territories is built on. As a result of relationship building, partnerships and advocacy by Dene, Métis, and Inuvialuit we were able to uphold our traditions through funding for people to return to the land, for monitoring of our borders and  access to traditional foods and resources to support our peoples. From the early days of the pandemic, Northwest Territories essential workers have been at the forefront of our response, working day and night and spending countless hours away from their families and loved ones to keep us safe, while putting themselves at risk. You make us proud. They are our health care professionals who have kept our communities safe. In this challenging time, you have put the residents of the Northwest Territories ahead of yourselves. Your courage, dedication, strength and selflessness have not gone unnoticed. The children and youth of the Northwest Territories are our future, and we are grateful for the ingenuity, passion, and strength of our educators who have adapted to give them tools they need to be successful. They are the grocery store workers who continued to stock shelves and ring our groceries through at checkout. They are transportation workers who move people and goods where they need to go. They are the municipal service workers who continue to pump sewage and deliver water to homes across the territory. They are the first responders who work round the clock to keep our communities safe. They are the shelter workers who take care of our most vulnerable residents. They are the women, parents, and caregivers who provided support for our children as the result of daycare and school closures, and the needed care for NWT elders.  They are the postal workers who continue to deliver the mail. They are the custodians and cleaning staff who work hard to keep public and community areas clean. They are maintenance workers who keep the heat, lights and water on in our homes. They are the resilient business owners who have used innovation and creativity to continue to serve residents and keeping communities safe and stocked. They are you, the residents. You have made so many sacrifices over the last year to protect yourselves, your loved ones, and your communities. We know this has not been easy, but we are forever grateful for the collective efforts of residents to support the efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories.  If there is one thing that we have all learned in the last year is that despite the challenges of the pandemic, we can succeed in the most difficult circumstances if we work together.

173,2021-03-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-community-elections,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Community Elections ,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, local elections are important to community residents as they provide an opportunity to select a municipal government that reflects the wants and needs of the community. Being an elected official is one of the best ways that an individual can support their community in providing a safe, sustainable, and healthy environment for their residents. In 2020, there were ten municipal elections in the Northwest Territories, 	where 83 candidates competed for 44 available on behalf of cabinet seats.  I want to extend congratulations to all who were elected, and sincere thanks to all those who let their names stand in a race to represent and give back to their communities. This year, there will be 21 community municipal elections held. Four Tłı̨cho communities- Behchokǫ, Gametì, Whatì and Wekweètì will hold elections for four chiefs and 28 councillors positions in June; June is also when the Charter Communities of Tsiigehtchic and Fort Good Hope will fill 11 councillor seats; Later, in October, these include which fall under the Cities, Towns and Villages Act, will seek to fill five mayor positions and 38 councillor seats. 		the Town of Hay River; the Town of Inuvik; the Town of Norman Wells; the Town of Fort Smith; and, the Village of Fort Simpson.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, in December there will be ten hamlet communities electing six mayors and 39 councillors.   These include: 		Aklavik; Enterprise; Fort Liard; Fort McPherson; Fort Providence; Fort Resolution; Paulatuk; Sachs Harbour; Tuktoyaktuk; and Ulukhaktok.  Mr. Speaker, these elections are an important opportunity where aspiring candidates in each of these communities can run for a community municipal leadership position and where residents have the opportunity to choose their municipal leadership.  The Department of Municipal and Community Affairs continues to work with the NWT Association of Communities and community governments to promote participation in municipal politics. Best of luck to all individuals that put their name forward as a candidate this year and to each community as they make choices on their local leadership.  I want to thank all those who may consider putting their name forward as a candidate in the upcoming elections.  I want to acknowledge the staff and many volunteers who take on roles in the election process on behalf of the municipalities.  It takes dedication and significant effort by many people to support the election process behind the scenes. Elections provide an opportunity for all individuals to serve as leaders and decision-makers the opportunity to shape the future for their friends, neighbours, and fellow residents. It is important that our elections are open and accessible to all. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Mr. Speaker, the 19 Legislative Assembly has identified making strategic infrastructure investments that connect communities, expand the economy and reduce the cost of living as a priority. These projects will also support the Northwest Territories economy as we look at ways to recover from the impacts of COVID-19. Mr. Speaker, one project that supports our government’s efforts to meet this priority is the Tłı̨chǫ Highway. Construction of this all-season road began in the fall of 2019. Despite a brief six-week pause in work caused by COVID-19 last spring, the project remains both on schedule and on-budget, with substantial completion and official opening expected in fall of 2021. To date, approximately 97 kilometres of embankment construction and 45 kilometres of gravel surfacing have been completed. Out of four bridges, three have been completed, and the remaining one will be completed this coming summer. Seasonal construction ended on December 15, 2020 and will resume in the spring. When the Tłı̨chǫ Highway is completed, this two-lane gravel highway will provide year-round access from NWT Highway No. 3 to the community access road to Whatı̀. The project will help to connect communities, support employment and training opportunities across the region, increase our territory’s resiliency to climate change, and create new social and economic opportunities. The Tłı̨chǫ Highway will end at kilometre 97 where it connects with the existing Whatı̀ Access Road. We are continuing to explore opportunities with the Tłı̨chǫ Government to improve the condition of the Whatı̀ Access Road, and we are currently working on design and obtaining a water licence, and assessing funding options for that initiative. Mr. Speaker, the Tłı̨chǫ Highway represents a true collaboration between the Community Government of Whatı̀, the Tłı̨chǫ̨ Government, Kiewit Canada Development Corporation, the federal government, and the GNWT. It is an example of how infrastructure on NWT Indigenous territory can be carried out. The Tłı̨chǫ Highway runs through Tłı̨chǫ Lands, and the Tłı̨chǫ Government’s 20% equity ownership in North Star Infrastructure is reflective of this important fact. The Tłı̨chǫ Highway has been a positive step towards reconciliation and we will take lessons learned to apply to future projects. Like all of us, North Star Infrastructure has had the added challenge this past year of keeping their staff and the surrounding communities safe during the pandemic. North Star Infrastructure has an extensive COVID-19 mitigation plan in place that complies with the Chief Public Health Officer's orders and guidelines. I commend their commitment to ensuring the safety of their employees while keeping the project on track.    Increasing access to Tłı̨chǫ communities will help to reduce the cost of living in the region and support new social opportunities, while also attracting interest from industry in the exploration and development of natural resources. I will continue to provide updates as we progress through the project timelines and look forward to the day when we can celebrate this achievement for the community of Whatı̀ and the Tłı̨chǫ region. Quyanainni, Mr. Speaker."

The mandate document outlines the actions our government is taking to advance the 22 priorities established by this Legislative Assembly, and includes timelines and measures for tracking our progress.  The priorities reflect actions that the 19 of us agreed needed to be advanced, and we collectively developed them in recognition that these actions were needed to strenthen the social and economic status of the Northwest Territories.  To say that a lot has happened since the mandate was first tabled is an understatement. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all of us over the past year. It has changed how our government delivers programs and services, and how we advance major projects and initiatives. It has changed how we work with our partners in the business and social sectors and with community governments, and our relationship with Indigenous governments. It has changed fundamental assumptions about how people live, work and do business in the Northwest Territories, across Canada, and around the world. While there are very hopeful signs that the worst impacts of the pandemic are behind us, it is not over yet.  We collectively need to continue to demonstrate resilience and commitment to our communities and people. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that, despite the challenges of the pandemic and the delays we initially encountered as we turned our focus to our response, we expect that the majority of our government’s mandate will be achieved within the life of this Legislative Assembly, reasonably close to our original anticipated timelines. With this in mind, later today, I will table the first annual status report on the implementation of the mandate. The report reflects on a full year of our government’s work, from February 2020 to January 2021, to advance and fulfill our commitments. It highlights some of our government’s major accomplishments from the past year, as well as a number of expected achievements for the upcoming year. The report also provides detailed tracking of the status of the commitments, actions, timelines and performance measures outlined in the mandate. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with Members some of the highlights from the annual status report. In the past year, our government has made it a priority to build and strengthen our relationships with Indigenous governments. This work has included establishing the Special Committee on Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs with Regular Members, and continuing to work to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We have also worked to improve culturally respectful social supports such as On-the-Land healing programs and counselling programs, and to provide support for Indigenous governments to deliver mobile addictions treatment, family-based treatment and aftercare programming. Further efforts to improve social supports for all residents that need them have included making policy changes to help low income seniors and persons with disabilities address home repairs, improving access to social services through Integrated Services Delivery, and putting in place a program for non-governmental organizations to fund facility repairs, address code issues and undertake retrofits to support new childcare spaces. Mr. Speaker, over the coming year, our government will continue to respond to the pandemic and protect the health and safety of our residents, while looking ahead to capture opportunities for social and economic recovery so we can emerge stronger. Many of the actions related to social and economic recovery we will take are already captured in our mandate, which we will continue to advance. These actions include continuing to advance Aboriginal rights negotiations with Indigenous governments, making policy and program changes to improve social supports, advancing major infrastructure projects that will provide opportunities for Northerners, improving government procurement to maximize benefits for Northern residents and businesses, and many others. We recognize that we will need to redouble our efforts and continue working collaboratively with our partners, including Members of the Legislative Assembly, Indigenous governments, community governments, federal, territorial and provincial governments, to continue to advance mandate commitments. We will also continue to build relationships with non-government organizations, the private sector and residents throughout the North. Teamwork is now more important than ever, as we turn our attention from response to recovery, to rebuild and emerge stronger from the impact of the pandemic. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work this government has completed so far, and I am optimistic that the momentum we have built during the first year of this Legislative Assembly’s term, and especially as we emerge from the impacts of the pandemic, will translate into an increased rate of progress on our commitments. The work I have talked about today represents just some of the progress we have made to implement the mandate. The mandate will continue to be an important tool for measuring the success of this government and the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly, and I look forward to reporting additonal progress in the future. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Living Well Together – Indigenous Cultural Awareness and Sensitivity Training, is a self-directed eLearning course made up of eight modules divided into two series: The Truth series (Modules 2-5), which raises awareness about colonization, residential schools and Indigenous/non-Indigenous relations, and the Reconciliation series (Modules 6-8), which focuses on developing cultural sensitivity and the practice of reconciliation. The GNWT is committed to building and maintaining a workforce that embraces diversity, cultural awareness and inclusion, and this educational training program is a vital step toward that objective. The focus of Living Well Together is to help GNWT employees further develop cultural competencies and play a more active role in reconciliation. Intended for GNWT employees, Living Well Together contains a wealth of important information and learning opportunities for anyone who wants to learn more about intercultural competency, conflict resolution, human rights, and anti-racism. The full training is publicly available through the Department of Finance website. Quote Living Well Together was created in the spirit of reconciliation and provides opportunities for our employees to reflect on ways we can all support reconciliation and decolonization as public servants and private citizens; in the workplace; and within the community. Through careful reflection and deliberate acts of reconciliation, we can make positive changes throughout the Northwest Territories and serve as an example for the rest of Canada. -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance Quick facts Living Well Together – Indigenous Cultural Awareness and Sensitivity Training, is a self-directed eLearning course made up of eight modules.

178,2021-03-09,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-celebrating-social-work-month,Government Website,Julie Green: Celebrating Social Work Month ,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, in March of each year, we celebrate social workers across Canada and in the NWT.  This year’s theme for Social Work Month is Social Workers are Essential. Mr. Speaker, social workers play a vital role in supporting and maintaining individual, family and community well being across the Northwest Territories.  Social workers are trained to help people address personal and systemic barriers that negatively impact them realizing their full potential. Social workers perform a variety of functions and roles in our communities. Some work in schools, helping children get the services they need to get the best possible education. Others provide mental health services, helping people overcome mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety as well as substance use disorders. When families are in crisis social workers are there to help them rebuild healthy relationships.  Social workers can be found in hospitals, helping patients get optimal care not only while in treatment but when they return to their families and communities. Social workers also help us to cope with the loss of loved ones. Mr. Speaker, social workers also play an integral in community organizations and in government, helping create programs and policies to make our society a better and more equitable place for all. This type of work requires a passion for helping others and a commitment to making a difference in people’s lives. These professionals have an ethical obligation to advocate for broad social change to address social inequalities that will benefit the marginalized members of our communities, and ultimately, all of us. Mr. Speaker, Members of this House know the 19th Legislative Assembly made it a mandate priority to improve early childhood development for all children. There are a number of activities being implemented across government to support this priority, including efforts to improve the delivery of children and family services, and health and wellness in the NWT.    The Government of the Northwest Territories has invested a significant amount of funding to improve services for children, youth and families in their communities.  Social workers advance and provide these services across the NWT.  In the last two years, we have funded 15 new social work positions and a number of supporting positions. On February 1, 2021 the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority restructured the Child, Family and Community Wellness Division to better focus the work, and bring staff under the umbrella of one team. This change in organizational structure will streamline processes for staff and allow for better collaboration and more consistent delivery of programs across the Territory. These investments and new structures will better support social workers in the delivery of these important services. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Cabinet, I want to express how much our government appreciates the hard work and dedication of social workers. I am pleased to have this opportunity to recognize the commitment and positive contributions these individuals make in the lives of children, youth and families in our communities and thank them for their continued efforts.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Simpson: Aurora College Research Mandate and Recognition ,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, one of the many exciting developments to expect as we get closer to launching the polytechnic university is increased capacity for Northern research. We know that the work underway, to increase the number of researchers and build effective research supports, for College partners and stakeholders across the Northwest Territories will serve as catalysts for Northern social and economic development. In the areas of research, Aurora College is starting from a place of strength and great promise for the future. In December, it was again recognized as one of Canada’s Top 50 Research Colleges for 2020 Aurora College improved its overall ranking among the nation’s top research Colleges from 48th in 2019 to 29th in 2020, where it ranked in the top 10 in two categories: research growth, and in research intensity. Mr. Speaker, Aurora College recognizes the importance of ongoing collaborations and partnerships with other institutions, Indigenous and community governments, and non-governmental organizations. Leading efforts to ensure the success of research partners is an important part of the work already underway at Aurora College. During a year of significant public health restriction that threatened long-term research initiatives, Aurora College found innovative ways to leverage its strong presence across the Northwest Territories and helped support the territorial, national and international research community during these challenging times. Aurora College continues to take steps to increase research capacity in advance of becoming a polytechnic university. In addition to adding seven new Aurora College research associates that will bring new perspectives and ideas, Aurora College also formalized research partnerships with Hotıì ts’eeda and the Institute of Circumpolar Health Research. These partnerships strengthen Northern research capacity and increase their ability to access federal funding. Mr. Speaker, over the coming year, Aurora College will continue building research capacity with the hiring of three new research chair positions. Aurora Campus in Inuvik will see the establishment of a Climate Change Adaptation Research Chair; Thebacha Campus in Fort Smith will house the Research Chair for Indigenous Approaches to Environmental Management and the Yellowknife North Slave Campus will see the addition of a Health and Community Research Chair. These positions are supported through the College’s partnership with ArcticNet, a Network of Centres of Excellence of Canada, and will help to strengthen the initial areas of teaching and research specialization for the polytechnic university. Mr. Speaker, we see the future polytechnic university sitting at the centre of our knowledge economy and building a stronger future for our businesses and residents, including by empowering our youth to be research leaders of the future. The College accessed external funding this year to create youth and student positions in research, administrative and logistic roles. This project encourages youth to pursue their interest in education and employment in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM. The journey to build research capacity will not end with the establishment of a polytechnic university in 2025, it will continue to empower students to understand and respond to the challenges they face for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, all of this work will support the College’s successful transformation to a polytechnic university, an institution where research will be a part of every aspect of the institution. Building on current research experience on topics such as climate change, permafrost, heavy metals in soil, renewable energy feasibility studies, intimate partner violence and many others, the polytechnic university will work to forge stronger ties with Indigenous governments, communities, industry and the business community to ensure we always look ahead to a stronger, more prosperous and resilient future. I want to commend Aurora College for the success it has achieved as they work to create the Northern research leaders of tomorrow at an institution that will be built in the North, for the North and by the North. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Developed by the Department of Finance in collaboration with the departments of  Education, Culture and Employment and Health and Social Services, Living Well Together replaces the GNWT’s previous Aboriginal Cultural and Sensitivity Training for its employees. It is a direct response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call for Action with respect to professional development and training for public servants. Mr. Speaker, the Commission has called upon all levels of government I quote “to provide education to public servants on the history of Indigenous peoples, including the history and legacy of residential schools, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Treaties and Aboriginal rights, Indigenous Law, and Aboriginal-Crown Relations” end quote.  According to the Commission, “this will require skills-based training in intercultural competency, conflict resolution, human rights, and anti-racism.” Living Well Together is built on the Northern Studies Curriculum provided to our students within the Northwest Territories and includes diverse and authentic perspectives of Indigenous peoples from across the Northwest Territories. Many courageous Northerners shared their personal stories on a wide variety of topics, including the impacts of residential schools. Mr. Speaker, these are important stories that all northerners, especially our public servants should listen to and learn from.  On behalf of Cabinet, I want to thank each and every northerner who told their story so that we could develop this training.  This includes many Elders, Indigenous governments, community members, Indigenous artists and GNWT employees who contributed to this training in so many valuable ways. Living Well Together was created in the spirit of reconciliation and provides opportunities for our employees to reflect on ways to support reconciliation and decolonization as public servants and private citizens, in the workplace, and within the community. Through careful reflection and deliberate acts of reconciliation, we can make positive changes throughout the Northwest Territories and serve as an example for the rest of Canada. With this in mind, this training will be mandatory for all employees, and the Department of Finance will endeavor to support all current GNWT employees to complete this training within 12 months. My Special Advisor and I had the benefit of a sneak peak and decided to act as one another’s learning partners. We plan to schedule occasions over the coming months to work through the modules together. Mr. Speaker, we expect that this training will have an immeasurable impact on not only our Public Service but also on the communities we serve. We believe this training has the potential to benefit all residents of the Northwest Territories and will set an example for the rest of Canada. As such, this training will be made available to the public. Living Well Together was developed in the spirit of reconciliation and I encourage all employees to begin this training with an open mind and to support one another during this process. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

184,2021-03-08,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/premier-cochrane-commemorates-international-womens-day,Government Website,Premier Cochrane Commemorates International Women’s Day,"Premier Caroline Cochrane issued the following statement on International Women’s Day: “Today we commemorate International Women’s Day, a global celebration of the women and girls in our lives who have made immeasurable contributions to making the Northwest Territories, Canada, and the world, a better place for everyone.  A little over a century ago, women were fighting for the right to vote, and the right to stand for office. Fast forward to 2019, and Northwest Territories residents voted in the first gender-balanced Legislature in Canadian history. This wouldn’t have been possible if it wasn’t for trailblazing feminists and activists who fought for what they believed in and challenged the status quo of a system that was created with a significant gender imbalance. We have made great strides as a society to advance gender equality – but we still have a lot of work to do. Women continue to face gender-based barriers and discrimination, and these obstacles make it difficult for women to get an equal footing.  We must continue to work together to develop and implement strategies to eliminate these barriers,  prevent violence against women and girls, update policies and programs to promote the development of women in leadership positions and continue the momentum as we strive to achieve gender equality. The full participation and leadership of women in all aspects of society enriches the lives of us all, and supports a kinder, more progressive world. However, women remain underrepresented in public life, and decision-making. Some of the best responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been led by women – not only as politically-elected leaders, but at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19. They include health care professionals, from cleaning staff to doctors, who continue to put their lives at risk every day to help people. They are scientists who have helped develop vaccines to protect residents and communities from the virus. They are the educators who have adapted and have continued to educate the future generation of leaders. International Women’s Day was established in the early years of the 20th Century to promote equal rights. These efforts laid the foundation for women to continue the fight against gender-based discrimination, patriarchal values, and systemic gender oppression that has held women back from being equal participants in our society. As we celebrate the creativity, solidarity, and resilience of the women and girls all around us, it’s important we remain committed to a world where women have a meaningful seat at the decision-making table."

Demanding better pay, and voting rights, 15,000 women marched through the streets of New York City in 1908. By 1911, the first International Women’s Day was honoured by several European nations, with more than one million women and men attending rallies in support of women’s rights to work, vote, hold public office and end discrimination. Fast forward to 2019 Mr. Speaker, and Northwest Territories residents voted in the first gender-balanced Legislature in Canadian history. This would not have been possible if it was not for trailblazing Canadian feminists and activists who fought for what they believed in and challenged the status quo of a system that was created with a significant gender imbalance. We have made great strides as a society to advance gender equality, but we still have a lot of work to do. Women continue to face gender-based barriers and discrimination, and these obstacles make it difficult for women to get an equal footing.  The world has been accustomed to male politicians, and there is a certain societal expectation that says female politicians should play nice. If we are seen as aggressive or having too strong a voice, it is easy to characterize us using negative and misogynist stereotypes. In many places, women are still seen as incapable of taking on responsibility in what are perceived as male-oriented areas, such as finance, energy, economic development, climate change, foreign affairs, defense, trade and infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, this is often the case in parliaments where women are given ‘women’s only’ portfolios or only allowed to sit in women committees and are being pushed away from the other committees because of their gender. At times, it is a tougher environment for female politicians, Mr. Speaker. We have a microscope pointed on our activities all the time. The detractors just waiting for us to fail so they can say “I told you so”. I remember when I was elected Premier, people were saying things like I could not lead, that the economy was going to fail. The sky has not fallen with my election as Premier and I would argue that we have weathered the past year well. Mr. Speaker, the impact of representation is critical to the younger generations.  It is about being a role model and paving the way for young women to aspire to do great things, to be doctors, teachers, CEOs, and political leaders. The more women that get elected into any kind leadership position, the more it shows younger women and the women around us that they can do it too. I remember hearing a story about Norway’s Defense Minister. Important context, between 2001 and 2017, six of the seven Defense Ministers in Norway were female. A young boy was talking to the then Defense Minister and asked, “can boys be Defense Minister?” It is a good reminder that we all look for what we see, to understand what can be. Representation is key. It is important to me that the next generation of women take up this fight as well, Mr. Speaker. I am glad that there are greater resources and role models to not only show that it is possible, but to provide the “know-how” to do it. We must continue to work together to develop and implement strategies to eliminate these barriers, prevent violence against women and girls, update policies and programs to promote the development of women in leadership positions and continue the momentum as we strive to achieve gender equality. Mr. Speaker, the full participation and leadership of women in all aspects of society enriches the lives of us all, and supports a kinder, more progressive world.

191,2021-03-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-international-womens-day,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: International Women’s Day,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, I rise today in advance of International Women’s Day. In 1975, the United Nations designated March 8th as an opportunity for unity, celebration, reflection, advocacy and action about the place and role of women across the social, economic, cultural, and political fabric of the world. While it is a day for celebration, on reflection, we must raise awareness of the work that is left to be done towards gender equality. The theme of this year’s International Women’s Day is Choose to Challenge. Mr. Speaker, I decided to search the definition of challenge. What I found is that to challenge is to question the correctness of something. In other words, to ask ourselves, if a way of being, a way of thinking, as assumption that things must be a certain way, is in fact based on fact and evidence or if it might be based on beliefs we were raised with, assumptions, stereotypes or fear.  If we all choose to challenge, we acknowledge that we likely all have some beliefs, assumptions, ideas or views that should be questioned.   The theme also challenges everyone to identify and call out gender bias and inequality and to work on changing people’s attitudes and behaviours in order to create a fairer, more inclusive society.   Mr. Speaker, governments can also choose to challenge. Doing things the way they have always been done is easier. The processes and the systems are in place. But to truly challenge those processes and those systems takes courage, patience, and humility. Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories is choosing to challenge inequality by proposing the creation of a Gender Equity Unit. The work of the Gender Equity Unit will include: Making sure the GNWT’s commitment to gender equality is included and reflected in budgets, policies and programs; Promoting and training staff on how to use Gender-Based Analysis Plus to assess how diverse groups of women/girls, men/boys, and gender-diverse people may experience government policies, programs and initiatives; Coordinating cross-departmental action on gender issues and women’s economic empowerment; and, Promoting gender equity and leadership at senior levels. In short, Mr. Speaker, the Gender Equity Unit needs to challenge the way we make decisions and allocate resources. History and science tell us that challenging social norms and standing up for a diversity of voices and perspectives can improve decision-making and organizational functioning. But that choice is far from easy. This will make our decision making better, more inclusive, and more productive. The Gender Equity Unit will also support the continuation of the Campaign School for Women, which equips women with tools and supports to run for elected leadership. The success of the Campaign School for Women can be measured by the increased number of women who are running for office. We need to choose to challenge our own ideas of who should run and who should win and what they are capable of. In this Chamber, the elected leadership of the Northwest Territories now counts nine women around this circle, the most women ever elected to a Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, one election does not mean that the challenge of gender equity is conquered. We, all of us, cannot allow ourselves to forget that one election has not changed the fact that the Northwest Territories was until this election at or near the bottom in terms of gender representativeness across Canada, or that we still have the second highest rate of gender-based violence. We must still choose to challenge every day, in how we govern, and in how we look at one another. As the Minister Responsible for the Status of Women, I choose to challenge. I choose to challenge gender bias. I choose to challenge inequality. I choose to challenge discomfort, fear, and unfamiliarity and to embrace my role as a Member of the 19th Legislative Assembly to ensure that gender diversity becomes a new normal and not merely historic.   Mr. Speaker, I hope others can take a moment to consider whether or how they too can choose to challenge in celebration of International Women’s Day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The Northwest Territories Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola has issued two new Public Health Orders that amend the Public Health Order – COVID-19 Travel Restrictions and Self-Isolation Protocol – to allow residents of Fort Simpson and Norman Wells to self-isolate in their home community. Both communities, being regional centres, have: Adequate medical resources to support new cases that arise, including stabilization of any severe cases pending transport to another centre. Completed the second dose clinics of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in Fort Simpson and Norman Wells this week. Active wastewater surveillance with collections occurring twice per week. Regional compliance and enforcement officers located in the community.  This allows residents of Fort Simpson and Norman Wells the opportunity to safely isolate in their home communities instead of one of the four regional hub isolation centres. Prior to this amendment, anyone living in the two communities returning from travel outside the NWT was required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Hay River, Fort Smith or Inuvik. In order to self-isolate in either of these communities, residents must: Submit a Self-Isolation Plan to Protect NWT prior to, or within 24 hours of, entering the NWT. Safely self-isolate for 14 days in their home community immediately upon entering the NWT, in accordance with the self-isolation requirements in the Public Health Order, and their approved Self-Isolation Plan. Only travel to their home community once their Self-Isolation Plan is approved. These Public Health Orders are effective March 4, 2021 at 5 p.m. and will remain in place for the duration of the Public Health Emergency, unless rescinded. Quotes Self-isolation for 14 days can be challenging for individuals. Allowing residents of Fort Simpson and Norman Wells to safely self-isolate in their home communities will address some of those challenges and offer a greater sense of well-being in more familiar surroundings, while continuing to keep our residents and communities healthy and safe.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services “Allowing self-isolation in Fort Simpson and Norman Wells is an example of a measured approach to easing our public health measures. I am thankful we have been able to amend the order to make the 14 days of self-isolation less challenging now that residents of these two communities have received two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.” - Dr. Kami Kandola, Chief Public Health Officer of the Northwest Territories Quick facts Only residents of Norman Wells and Fort Simpson will be able to self-isolate in these communities. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is reported to be 92% effective 14 days or more after the first dose, meaning people begin building strong protection against the disease with one shot. Vaccine effectiveness increases following the second dose.

Throughout the Northwest Territories, the health and social services system works to provide quality services for all NWT residents, care that is respectful, responsive and accessible. However, research shows that Indigenous peoples experience a disproportionate amount of negative health and social outcomes in comparison to 	non-Indigenous people.  It is our responsibility as a government to address this inequity directly by making sure that all aspects of health and social services system are culturally respectful and safe for Indigenous peoples. This also includes respecting Indigenous understandings of health and wellness and finding ways to accommodate traditional healing in our system. Mr. Speaker, leadership at all levels is critical in taking the steps necessary to address racism in the health and social service system and is essential to sustain it. The need for coordinated leadership is one reason I appreciated the opportunity to participate in recent national dialogues to address Anti-Indigenous Racism in Canada’s Health Care Systems. The meeting included 500 people from across the country and offered a powerful opportunity for governments and organizations to listen, reflect and consider ways to advance this work at the national, provincial and territorial level. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Health and Social Services established a division dedicated to addressing Indigenous health disparities and included a priority focus on cultural safety in 2013. Staff conducted research, and worked collaboratively with Indigenous residents, knowledge holders and leaders to set our strategic vision to meet our overall goal of ensuring that clients and their families feel safe, respected and free from racism and discrimination when they access our health and social services system. Mr. Speaker, in 2019, the Department advanced this work with the release of the Cultural Safety Action Plan. Grounded in community voices, the Action Plan took a nothing about us without us approach; over 30 meetings were held across the NWT over approximately nine months. The Action Plan includes 27 actions organized under four key themes: Create an organizational culture of cultural safety; Strengthen staff capacity to deliver culturally safe care; Honour traditional knowledge and healing approaches in care; and, Improve client and community experience. Mr. Speaker, since the release of the Action Plan the Department has worked to pilot 13 cultural safety training sessions The pilots included content on Indigenous medicine teachings, Indigenous experiences of residential schools and inter-generational impacts, and understanding racism at interpersonal and systemic levels.  Approximately 225 health and social services system employees participated in these pilots. The Department is now developing an NWT Cultural Safety Framework, which is being reviewed by the Indigenous Advisory Body and Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Leadership Council. Once finalized, I will share it with Members. As a final point, Mr. Speaker, we’ve heard that cultural safety and anti-racism work must be led by Indigenous people. Much of the work that I have just outlined will be led by a new Cultural Safety and Anti-Racism unit dedicated to leading our system’s efforts to embed cultural safety and anti-racism into the fabric of our health and social services system. The existing team is comprised almost entirely of Indigenous staff from multiple nations and regions in the NWT. As the team expands, we are committed to ensuring that positions are open to applicants from any community in the NWT, and that the senior positions are all filled by Indigenous staff that have been mentored and supported to take on leadership roles to advance this work. Mr. Speaker, we have done the research, and the collaborative development with Indigenous peoples and communities in the territory to set our strategic vision and the action plans to guide this work. Now the focus is on embedding cultural safety and anti-racism in a meaningful and sustainable way to achieve our vision of a territory where Indigenous peoples, families and communities enjoy physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health and wellness.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
194,2021-03-03,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-anti-racism-campaign,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Anti-Racism Campaign,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to providing a safe and inclusive workplace for all its employees. This includes educating our public servants on how racism can manifest itself in the workplace. Racism is a belief in a hierarchy of human value. It is a belief, conscious or unconscious, that some people are worth more than others. Racism is easy to see when it takes the form of specific acts of hate and violence but systemic racism hides in plain sight: it is the kind of racism where the power of one racial group is exhibited and upheld over others in institutions including schools, law enforcement, health care and a workplace. By contrast, anti-racism is about acknowledging the inherent privilege held by certain racial groups over others. Anti-racism is about speaking up when you see racism in action and educating those around you about the benefits of diversity within our communities and workplaces. It is about yielding positions of power to those who are otherwise marginalized, advocating for policies that break down systems of oppression and promoting not only equality but equity. In addition to the work underway to implement mandatory cultural awareness training, the Department of Finance will launch an anti-racism campaign. The Department of Finance will launch this anti-racism campaign to run between March 16 and April 21 that will encourage all GNWT employees to challenge their beliefs and attitudes around racism. The goal of this campaign is to encourage employees to learn about anti-racism so they can take steps to stand against systemic racism and stand up for marginalized persons within our communities. We recognize that in order to eliminate systemic racism in the NWT, we must build a culture of anti-racism within the public service. Mr. Speaker, the first component of this campaign is training. The Equitable Workplace: Cultivating Attitudes of Anti-Racism and Allyship aims to help participants identify strategies to confront racism and become agents of change. Participants will learn to identify how biases, racism, power, and privilege are the root of myths and misconceptions that have become part of mainstream culture. The campaign will also include printed and video resources that encourage public servants to explore anti-racism and to take action against all forms of racism when they see it. Mr. Speaker, as a government we have a duty to provide a safe and inclusive workplace for all employees, and this campaign is one small step in our mission to foster an anti-racist culture in all GNWT workplaces. Employees can register for the The Equitable Workplace: Cultivating Attitudes of Anti-Racism and Allyship training on the Learning and Development Calendar located on the My HR website. I encourage all GNWT employees to complete this training and become agents of change within our public service and our communities. In particular, I encourage managers to work to ensure that their staff have the time available to take the training and model commitment to this important matter by taking it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
195,2021-03-03,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-systemic-racism,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Systemic Racism,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories has a moral and ethical obligation to root out racism in our institutions. This obligation extends beyond the overt, visible, and obvious acts of hate and violence that we can easily see and condemn. It includes the subtle, hidden, systemic racism that persists in legislation, policies, and practices. Systemic racism is real, it exists in the Northwest Territories, and it exists in our government. Some of our institutions, policies, and practices continue to disadvantage or discriminate against black, Indigenous and people of colour. We continue to see examples of people facing discrimination based on their national origin, race, religion, ethnicity, and culture. It is an uncomfortable truth, but one that we must fearlessly acknowledge and confront if we want to change. Mr. Speaker, the Mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories 2019-2023  identifies implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as one of our priorities. Done within the constitutional framework of Canada, this work will advance reconciliation, but is not possible if we do not acknowledge and take tangible steps to eliminate systemic racism. The U.N. Declaration sets the stage very clearly: “that all doctrines, policies and practices based on or advocating superiority of peoples or individuals on the basis of national origin or racial, religious, ethnic or cultural differences are racist, scientifically false, legally invalid, morally condemnable and socially unjust.” The Government of the Northwest Territories is taking steps to ingrain these principles into our legislation, policies, and institutions. In December we announced the results of our work with the Intergovernmental Council; an innovative legislative development protocol, the first of its kind in Canada, that provides opportunities for the collaborative development of land and resource statutes and regulations for the GNWT and Indigenous governments. Mr. Speaker, the decisions we make as a government must reflect our commitment to reconciliation and the affirmation and advancement of Indigenous rights and self- determination. We must foster constructive and respectful government-to-government relationships with Indigenous partners and seek ways to advance reconciliation, recognize and affirm Indigenous rights, and support expanded program and service delivery. We also continue to respond to the Calls for Justice in the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and the Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. Mr. Speaker, we are firmly committed to addressing systemic racism in the Government of the Northwest Territories. We are committed to learning from the mistakes of the past, and moving on from colonial, and outdated ways of thinking. We must embrace the principles of the U.N. Declaration, and the principles of anti-racism in the way that we approach all of our mandate commitments. There are some instances where the path forward seems more obvious, like when we talk about settling and implementing treaty, land, resources, and self-government agreements or in our ongoing work with justice, education and health. But we must also be vigilant in everything we do, to ensure we do not inadvertently continue to perpetuate the past. This Cabinet has, and continues to update the way we review, discuss, and consider the items that come before us. Mr. Speaker, we have formalized and strengthened the presence of gender and diversity in our financial and policy decisions. I encourage every Minister and every Member of the Legislative Assembly to embrace the principles of the U.N. Declaration, and the principles of anti-racism in every decision you make. When I worked in social services, I could see the impact that systemic racism has, and eliminating it is a cause that I fully endorse. I do this knowing that the path ahead will be long and difficult. Undoing years of systemic racism against black, Indigenous and people of colour will take time; change will be incremental; but I am determined. I know there is a lot of great work happening across government, and I look forward to my colleagues sharing examples of the work they are doing to address systemic racism. I am encouraged, and inspired, by the progress being made, but I acknowledge there is much more to do. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
196,2021-03-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-firefighter-recognition,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Firefighter Recognition ,"Check against delivery   Mr.  Speaker, the safety of our residents is a priority for the Government of the Northwest Territories.  Through the Office of the Fire Marshal and the Emergency Management Organization, the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs, or MACA, supports communities in building local capacity in response to emergencies. During 2020’s holiday season, our communities and residents suffered two serious fires in the Northwest Territories, or NWT.  As Minister for MACA, I would like to express my gratitude to all the emergency responders.    Unfortunately, these recent incidents highlight the fact that fire losses, particularly during the holiday season, do happen. Our work to prevent loss of life and property must continue to be a priority.   Fires can place a heavy burden on families, communities, and governments.  Providing fire services in the North is challenging for all community governments given our remote locations, limited access to resources and harsh environment.  Mr. Speaker, in order to deliver fire services, the NWT relies heavily on volunteer firefighters. The delivery of fire prevention and fire protection services in our communities would not be possible without the many career and volunteer firefighters across the NWT and their significant contributions. This is a tough job, thankfully we have many individuals who take on this duty. There is a tremendous commitment required to be a volunteer firefighter. These individuals: sacrifice time away from family and friends; must attend training to keep their skills fresh in order to safely respond to calls; have a role in educating residents in how they can protect themselves from fire; they respond to and investigate the cause of fires; and they have a role in inspecting our buildings to ensure people can get out safely. Mr. Speaker, given this very important role that firefighters have, it is essential that we recognize and acknowledge the efforts of those who provide these services which contribute to our safety and security. The first is a Long Service Recognition Program which awards recipients for NWT service with medals and pins for years of service; and The second is the NWT Fire Service Merit Award.  This award is presented to individual firefighters and/or community fire departments that have made significant contributions to the NWT fire service and community fire protection. Mr. Speaker, today I want to highlight the service of one of the Territories most outstanding volunteers and to celebrate the recipient of the 2020 NWT Fire Service Merit 	Award, Mr. David Bernhardt.  The community of Inuvik nominated Mr. Bernhardt for his contributions to the NWT Fire Service and an incredible 40 years of dedicated service to the residents of Inuvik.  	Originally from Cape Dyer, Nunavut, Mr. Bernhardt moved to Inuvik with his family early in the 1960s. He joined the Inuvik Fire Department in 1980 and has served as a firefighter, Lieutenant, Captain, and Deputy Fire Chief. In 2019, his colleagues bestowed him with the Canadian Municipal Long Service Award, which recognizes achievements of long-serving volunteer firefighters in communities across Canada. Today, Mr. Bernhardt remains an active member of the fire department, sharing his history and knowledge as a mentor to junior firefighters.  Although he no longer is on the front line of fighting fires, he currently ensures exterior firefighting operations run efficiently and more importantly, maintains a calm, steady presence with a watchful eye that provides for the safety of everyone at fire scenes. Mr. Bernhardt does not know when he will retire from volunteer firefighting, but he considers his fellow firefighters as family and loves to contribute in any way he can.   	Firefighter Bernhardt is a unique and admirable individual and so I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on receiving the 2020 NWT Fire Service Merit Award. I also want to thank all firefighters across the NWT for their dedication and commitment in making our Territory safer!  Mahsi, Mr. Speaker.  "

Their work is evident all around us – in our buildings, highways and airports; in our safe drinking water; in our power and communications; and in our mapping and resource development in the North, to name a few. These professions play an important role in achieving our priorities under the Mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories 2019 – 2023, such as making strategic infrastructure investments that connect communities, and investing in alternative and renewable energy. Mr. Speaker, professional engineering is at the core of the Department of Infrastructure. Engineering and Geoscience Week is an opportunity to express appreciation to the professional engineers and geoscientists who work hard every day, often in challenging environments, to protect public interest and safety, and to improve our quality of life. The Northwest Territories and Nunavut Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists, or NAPEG, will be celebrating their annual Engineering and Geoscience Week from February 27 to March 6, 2021. Normally, youth engagement, networking and professional development activities would be taking place in person, but this year, the venue has shifted to a virtual space.  The focus is to improve public awareness of the important role that these professionals have in the North. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Infrastructure recently took over responsibility for the administration of the Engineering and Geoscience Professions Act from the Department of Justice.  This will allow for the legislation to be administered by a department that has the knowledge and experience with the work of professionals to whom the legislation applies. We look forward to working with NAPEG and other stakeholders to review the Act to see what changes may be required so that it is responsive and reflective of the current needs of the public, the professions, and the industry. Mr. Speaker, later this sitting, I will be tabling the Good Building Practice for Northern Facilities 2020 manual. The 2020 Good Building Practice manual is an extensive update to the 2009 edition, and incorporates 10 years of research and development in new codes and standards, which many NWT Registered Engineers and technicians contributed to. It adds new sections for environmental regulations; climate change; and civil, environmental, geotechnical, and hazardous building material assessment considerations. It contains updated recommendations for more sustainable development, improvements in energy conservation, accessibility, as well as climate change adaptation and mitigation for northern buildings. Managing the full lifecycle of infrastructure in the North requires a deep awareness and understanding of the unique challenges and risks arising from harsh climatic conditions. The new edition of the manual illustrates the complexities that may be encountered when planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining infrastructure in remote cold regions. This manual supplements the objectives of national codes and standards and presents a compilation of best practices and requirements developed over many decades of experience designing and building in cold regions. It also incorporates new technologies and methods for northern infrastructure and is expected to benefit a broad range of stakeholders beyond the Government of the Northwest Territories, such as owners, developers, planners, designers and builders, as well as suppliers, building maintainers and operators. In preparing the updated Good Building Practice manual, the GNWT has drawn upon the expertise of numerous individuals from within the Department of Infrastructure, other GNWT departments, and private sector agencies. Many of them contributed technical writing and comments to this guidebook. We hope this kind of shared learning experience and cooperative effort can continue during the production of future editions. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to recognize the Northwest Territories’ past and present engineering and geoscience professionals. Their curiosity and creativity have led to the countless contributions that we enjoy today, and will undoubtedly play an important role in solving the challenges to come. Quyanainni, Mr. Speaker."
198,2021-03-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/hydrological-analysis-great-slave-lake-provides-information-about-high-water-levels-past,Government Website,Hydrological analysis of Great Slave Lake provides information about high water levels this past summer and fall ,"A team of hydrological experts from the Government of the Northwest Territories, Environment and Climate Change Canada, the Global Water Futures program from the University of Saskatchewan, as well as representatives from the Government of Alberta and BC Hydro are helping to shed light on the driving factors behind high water levels on Great Slave Lake. The multi-jurisdictional working group was formed in September 2020 by Environment and Climate Change Canada at the request of the Government of the Northwest Territories to better understand and explain the record high water levels observed in the summer and fall of 2020. A report released by the working group found that heavy precipitation throughout the basins that feed Great Slave Lake was the highest on record over a 20-year period (2001-2020). The analysis found very high inflows to Great Slave Lake from the Slave River, the largest tributary to the lake.  High flows on the Slave River were a result of very high flows on the Peace and Athabasca Rivers, as well as extremely high water levels in the Peace-Athabasca Delta and Lake Athabasca. Other local rivers that flow directly into Great Slave Lake also had much higher than normal flow rates. It is unusual for all of these inputs to be extremely high at the same time. The analysis also looked at the operation of the Williston Reservoir and the W.A.C. Bennett Dam on the Peace River in British Columbia. The analysis determined that the presence of the W.A.C. Bennett Dam likely reduced higher flows on the Peace and Slave rivers during the summer of 2020.  Preliminary modelling suggests water levels on Great Slave Lake may have reached even higher levels this summer without flow regulation.  The analysis was not able to address questions about winter or the upcoming spring and summer water levels because of unknown future conditions. Water levels over the next few months will depend on many variables, including the timing and volume of precipitation (i.e. snow and rain), thickness of river and lake ice, and the timing and rate of spring melt. Because the current conditions are unprecedented, it is not possible to make reliable predictions based on statistical modelling. Quotes “This has been an unprecedented year for water levels in the Northwest Territories, including on Great Slave Lake. I recognize our residents have a lot of questions about what caused the high water and the role of the W.A.C. Bennett Dam. Our government scientists have been working to get you those answers, in collaboration with Environment and Climate Change Canada, our transboundary partners and top experts in the field. We will continue to monitor and keep NWT residents informed about the quality and quantity of NWT waters moving forward.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources, Government of the Northwest Territories    “Last spring was a difficult time for many residents of northern Alberta, with ice jams and high river levels causing damage in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo and Mackenzie County. I recognize our neighbours to the north also faced challenges with high water in 2020 and that’s why I was happy to lend Alberta’s monitoring data and staff expertise to this hydrological analysis.” - Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks, Government of Alberta Quick facts Water levels on Great Slave Lake in summer and fall 2020 reached the highest level recorded since monitoring began in the 1930s. All major rivers feeding into Great Slave Lake also had higher than normal levels. Flows on the Slave River were extremely high, as a result of very high flows on the Peace and Athabasca Rivers. Flows were at or near record high levels for much of the summer on the Tazin, Taltson, Lockhart, Kakisa, and Hay rivers as well as the Fond du Lac River in Saskatchewan. Lake Athabasca reached the second highest water levels on record in 2020, and water levels in the Peace Athabasca Delta were also very high. Initial modeling suggests that Great Slave Lake water levels will not likely return to normal historical levels for an extended period of time. The higher-than-normal releases from the Williston Reservoir in July and August 2020 were due to the high inflow volumes received in the early spring and through the summer.

201,2021-03-01,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-procurement-review-0,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Procurement Review,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that as we focus this sitting on the government’s budget, including how GNWT spending impacts the NWT economy and the role it can play in our economic recovery efforts, we are also beginning a territory-wide conversation about our government’s procurement practices and policies. Procurement is a significant tool that can positively increase the benefits of government spending on the private sector and, as a result, on the economy as a whole. Ensuring that government procurement and contracting maximizes benefits to residents and businesses is a priority established by the 19th Legislative Assembly. Building on that, one of our government’s guiding principles is to ensure that the expenditure of public funds supports Northern businesses and maximizes economic benefits to Northerners. This is consistent with our long-standing commitment to support NWT businesses and grow a strong, diversified economy. The conversation that has formally begun around procurement is part of the effort to achieve this priority and advance this guiding principle. It is important to remember that the concerns and needs that led to this priority and, similarly, to the political recognition that it is time for new recommendations to improve procurement practices, came from the territory’s Indigenous governments and organizations, the business community and the public at large. Rightfully so, as the last comprehensive review was over a decade ago. The people of the NWT know, and have made clear, that we have an opportunity for positive and long-lasting change and we need to work together to achieve it.  At a time in our history when it is clearly needed, we are prepared to reset or re-imagine our government’s approach to buying and contracting the goods and services it needs to deliver its mandate. To that end, we have accelerated our mandate commitment to strengthen GNWT procurement policies and practices. Mr. Speaker, I have spoken in previous sittings about the procurement review. I want to use this opportunity to provide an update. Recently I announced the start of the process to get this very important work done with the release of a discussion paper, dedicated section of the ITI website and the introduction of our review panel. We have put a review panel in place that I am confident will remain open minded, objective, creative and responsive; and who I have personally asked to do so. The panel will hear from a variety of stakeholders and residents. From panel interviews, to written submissions, targeted-engagement opportunities and an online discussion platform, we are working to ensure that everyone has a means and opportunity to share their thoughts and perspectives. We want the panel to hear real experiences with government procurement: both positive and otherwise.  This should include specific examples of when the system did or did not work and collect innovative ideas, for making our procurement process better. The panel will also meet with officials from Indigenous governments, about GNWT procurement generally, and ideas for a possible Indigenous procurement strategy and ways to best achieve the economic goals of modern Treaties.  I will continue to reach out to Indigenous leaders as well for ongoing government to government discussions about GNWT procurement. We need everybody with an interest in this discussion to seek out the information and opportunities that are available to provide their input. Mr. Speaker, our use of a public review process reflects our confidence that the ideas and guidance needed on this important matter can be found in the leadership, experience and creativity that exist within the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, we want to continue to help stimulate economic growth and encourage entrepreneurship and local competition. Our review of public procurement is one part of work that must be done to support a resilient, more diverse economy.  I encourage everyone in our territory to contribute to this process. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The NWTAC promotes the exchange of information among community governments, working together to reach collective goals for our communities across the NWT. Together they are an effective and passionate voice for community governments. This year, due to the pandemic, the 2021 Annual General Meeting will be carried out virtually from February 25th to 27th. If ever we had any question about the importance of building strong relationships with community governments, this past year has clearly demonstrated how inter-reliant we are on each other. There has been a tremendous effort to work collaboratively and creatively to protect our residents, and their communities, against the effects of the COVID Pandemic. These partnerships we have built are stronger because of the development of these relationships with our community governments. This year’s AGM is another opportunity to further continuing to strengthen those relationships. Mr. Speaker, this is a time of complex changes in the world, especially with the effects of the COVID pandemic that we are all experiencing. This meeting remains an excellent conduit for networking, information-sharing and collaboration to achieve our mutual goals and provides community governments with a unified platform to focus on common issues as well as to provide feedback on Government of the Northwest Territories programs and services. I want to congratulate the NWTAC on their ability to continue with the AGM, ensuring that information continues to be shared and the work toward common goals continues to be a priority, while doing so in a manner that keeps everyone safe. The virtual agenda for this years NWTAC AGM is set to include many interactive sessions, as well as conducting their organization’s core business, such as approval of financial statements and budget, as well as the election of new directors. In addition, members will have an opportunity to approve their 2021 resolutions as well as reaffirming resolutions from previous years. One of the highlights of every NWTAC AGM is the ever-popular open discussions with the Premier and Cabinet. I know I am looking forward to these discussions and I am sure my colleagues are as well.  It is an excellent opportunity to hear directly from the leadership of our communities on their priorities and their concerns. This better enables this government to make informed decisions that reflect on-the-ground realities in our communities. On behalf of the Cabinet, I wish the NWT Association of Communities well with their upcoming AGM. I look forward to being part of the discussions and hearing from communities to better understand their priorities and concerns. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
204,2021-02-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-communications-and-community-engagement-covid-19-coordinating-secretariat,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Communications and Community Engagement COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, in a crisis, consistent and timely communications are crucial. The Government of the Northwest Territories understands the critical role of communications as part of our pandemic response it helps create safer behaviors, greater community solidarity, and in the end, improved health outcomes. Mr. Speaker, we have said right from the start of the pandemic that our priority is to protect the health and well-being of residents that is why the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat is using every tool at their disposal to connect with residents across the Northwest Territories. In the early days of the pandemic, we launched aggressive public outreach and advertising campaigns aimed at engaging NWT residents from our youngest to our Elders. These campaigns continue today, evolving as the pandemic changes.   Our comprehensive social media strategy allows our message to reach over 20,000 residents every week on Facebook and Twitter.  Mr. Speaker, radio reaches residents in 31 of our 33 communities and is critical to respecting valued oral traditions. We are running radio ads, many translated into Indigenous languages, seven days a week. Mr. Speaker, we have been investing in communications, but we have also relied on the northern media to share our message. Through regular media briefings, and a relationship built on timely information sharing, residents are kept informed. I want to thank the media for their efforts as you have played an important part in our success. An important part of how our government operates is building strong partnerships with Indigenous leadership and community governments. These relationships support our ability to educate and inform residents. The Chief Public Health Officer, and the Minister of Health and Social Services and the Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs and I meet regularly with Indigenous leaders and community governments to share information and ensure we are hearing their concerns and working closely with them. Meetings like this are part of our communication efforts and play a valuable role. These partnerships allow us to understand what residents want to know so that we can better target our communications efforts and ensure Indigenous leaders and community governments can support their residents and help limit the spread of COVID-19. Mr. Speaker, last month’s COVID-19 outbreak in Fort Liard reinforced its importance of partnerships and communications at work in a pandemic response. Key information that residents needed to know was written in plain language and shared with community leadership, first responders, and health officials to ensure message consistency. A door-to-door campaign was launched and written materials in English and Dene Zhatie were left with residents. We ran radio ads and designed posters in both languages. The GNWT partnered with CKLB Radio to run a programming, social media, and a voicemail call-in campaign called Dear Fort Liard that inspired hundreds of people across the territory to post videos and messages in support of residents. Mr. Speaker, just as important as our communications efforts is our approach to community engagement. In early January we changed our approach to paying for isolation centres after hearing from Members of the Legislative Assembly, Indigenous leaders, community governments, businesses and residents that we needed to reduce these costs. In response to this feedback the Isolation Centre Policy was revised to require residents to pay for stays related to discretionary travel, which has reduced costs. Mr. Speaker, the Secretariat recently coordinated check-in meetings with community government officials and key GNWT departments to provide information about the GNWT’s pandemic response and vaccines. These discussions also include pandemic planning in each community, potential funding opportunities, and community concerns. In response to suggestions made by community representatives at these meetings, the Secretariat has produced a comprehensive community toolkit. This toolkit contains posters and plain language fact sheets on recovering at home, safety protocols for out-of-territory essential workers, self-isolation and many other topics. This toolkit is available online and has been provided to community governments and the Northwest Territories Association of Communities. Finally, Mr. Speaker, the GNWT has been working with the NWT and Yellowknife Chambers of Commerce, and NWT Tourism to address some of the concerns of the business community. In response to suggestions raised by the Business Advisory Council, the Secretariat issued a Request for Tender for isolation centre services, which resulted in the issuance of 76 Standing Offer Agreements for these support services. Mr. Speaker, every day we see the success of our communications and engagement work in changing behaviours. This work has normalized wearing masks and keeping a safe distance from others. People understand the importance of self-isolation and following public health orders, and vaccine uptake is high. We are travelling less and staying home more. The business community has adapted, with many offering new and innovative services. Mr. Speaker, we are all safer as a result of our collective efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 to protect our loved ones, and our communities. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Tourism operators will be able to apply to the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment to cover the same fixed operating costs set out under the NBRF. Eligible operators will be able to claim up to $50,000 for expenses which can include: rent/mortgage; utilities (heat; electric; water and sewer; phone and internet); subscriptions (for example: financial or booking systems); and insurance. This is a one-time funding initiative designed to help companies through to April 1, 2021 when new government supports are anticipated to become available.  Expenses already covered by federal payments under the NBRF and the RRRF will not be eligible. Eligible tourism operators should contact their regional ITI Tourism Development Officer. Quote “The travel, tourism and accommodations sectors have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  In the absence of travellers or visitors to our territory, these “sectors at risk” have relied heavily on federal relief packages.

206,2021-02-25,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-food-security,Government Website,Julie Green: Food Security,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, March is Nutrition Month and I would like everyone to join me in celebrating. It is a time to highlight the importance of accessing and eating healthy food.  The theme this year is Good for You, Dieticians help you find your healthy. Dieticians support individuals to reach their nutrition goals both to prevent poor health and to improve their overall health. I am encouraging residents to find their healthy by talking to dieticians if they have access to one. There are other sources of good dietary information including traditional harvesters, and healthy food experts in their communities who may be able to offer support and guidance in making wholesome food choices to live a healthy life.  Nutritious eating looks different for everyone; our culture and traditions are an important part of what we eat and how we eat.     Mr. Speaker, I can not talk about Nutrition Month without talking about food insecurity. It is a major issue in the NWT. High transportation costs, rising food prices, along with changing environmental conditions that affect wildlife harvesting are compounding this issue.  Food is a vital part of culture, well-being and health. Food security is essential to our ability to make healthy choices and live our best lives. Research consistently shows the link between wholesome food choices and healthy eating. Having access to affordable and nutritious food is a vital determinant in improving the health and wellbeing of our people and communities. Mr. Speaker, addressing food insecurity is a priority for this government. We identified it in our mandate and have committed to increasing food security through efforts to support locally produced, harvested, and affordable food.  It is also a key priority in our Anti-Poverty Action Plan.  We have taken a whole of government approach to this issue through the establishment of the food security interdepartmental working group to ensure collaboration to address this important issue. Through our renewed Territorial Anti-Poverty Action Plan, Sustainable Livelihoods Action Plan and the Agriculture Strategy, we have begun work to support residents in accessing local sources of fresh food and ensure future generations have the skills they need to feed their families. We have taken action to improve food security by introducing new and enhanced programs to support harvesters and families going out on the land. A total of $330,000 in funding was provided for regional harvesting, a training and mentorship program, a pilot program for trapper mentorship, and assisting families to go out on the land. We continue to deliver the Small Scale Foods Program in each of the regions of the territory to assist in the non-commercial growing and production of food. This program helps underserved, remote communities and organizations operating within them, to get the resources they need to support and promote local agriculture. We also offer funding to eligible organizations in their efforts to improve food security in their communities through a variety of programs. Mr. Speaker, we know that addressing food security is a shared responsibility that requires a coordinated response from both the public and private sectors. It is important that we come together to identify priorities, challenges, and most importantly, solutions, to develop a path forward in our approach to improving food security.    In January, the Department of Health and Social Services hosted a virtual Anti-Poverty Round Table to continue this important work. Over 80 delegates from across the territory, representing Indigenous governments and organizations, community governments, non-governmental organizations and businesses, including local grocers and agricultural producers, discussed how to improve food security. Experts from the NWT, British Columbia, northern Manitoba, and Nunavut shared their knowledge and experiences on harvesting and local food production, with the goal of providing long-term solutions to food insecurity that address underlying issues and empower people to provide for themselves. They talked about innovative projects that are leading the way in developing healthy food systems here in the North as well as across the country. Representatives from the GNWT also provided an overview of the GNWT work on improving food security. Short panel discussions were followed by longer breakout sessions where delegates had an opportunity to discuss what they learned as well as share their thoughts and experiences. Delegates discussed how to build strong and sustainable systems so that hungry people had access to wholesome, affordable food. They talked about finding ways to include traditionally harvested food in local grocery stores and how to develop community specific, culturally-adapted harvesting strategies and practices to strive towards Indigenous food security. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank the Anti-Poverty Advisory Committee members for helping to plan the Round Table, all the presenters, and for sharing their experiences. Thank you also to all the delegates who attended. I hope everyone left with a shared commitment to creating a sustainable, healthy food system for their communities and the territory. The GNWT is currently working on a report summarizing what was discussed at the Round Table. I am looking forward to sharing the report with Members and making it available on the Anti-Poverty website later this year. Mr. Speaker, we all have a role in addressing poverty in the NWT so that residents have access to supports they need to live in dignity, with access to the basics of food and shelter so they can be full participants in their families and communities. Our commitment to ensuring residents have access to nutritious, affordable food is a critical component in advancing our poverty reduction goals.  This government will continue to actively collaborate with our partners to develop shared approaches and find innovate solutions so that we can move forward as an equitable and healthy territory. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
207,2021-02-25,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-supporting-nwt-harvesters,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Supporting NWT Harvesters,"Check against delivery  Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 has affected us all and the pandemic has highlighted why meeting these mandate commitments are so important. As global supply chains have been disrupted and economic activity has been restricted, the need for locally sourced food has become even more valuable. Northern harvesters and trappers have been deeply impacted by COVID-19. Their economic livelihoods have been affected, which is an important part of northern culture. That is why now, more than ever, we need to support harvesting and land-based programs. Mr. Speaker, I stood here during the last sitting and announced that the Government of the Northwest Territories, through the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, had launched three new programs in the Fall of 2020 aimed at supporting both families in need and harvesters during the pandemic. These programs included a country foods harvesting subsidy, harvesting training and mentorship funding and the launch of the Take a Family on the Land Program. I am proud to say that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources was able to support all eligible applications received under these programs and has provided an estimated $340,000 to harvesters and trappers. The funding was distributed to just over 20 organizations across the territory. But we are not done. For ongoing programs such as the Take a Family on the Land Program, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources plans to reach out to partner organizations this year to ask for feedback so that we can do an even better job next year. For the new pilot Trapper Mentorship Program, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources is working with interested regional Indigenous governments to collaborate on the development of the program to best meet regional needs. We are working hard towards launching this pilot program in the coming weeks. As for our fur industry, Northwest Territories trappers are well-positioned and protected from ongoing market disruption through the Government of the Northwest Territories’ Genuine Mackenzie Valley Fur Program. In 2020, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources increased both eligibility and grubstake amounts to offset the challenges trappers faced due to the recent downturn in the fur industry. We will continue to communicate with trappers to show our support for the industry. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources is also continuing to work with our partners to evaluate the existing programs and develop harvester mentorship programs that support a strong and resilient traditional economy. Mr. Speaker, it has been a tough year for harvesters and trappers. The Northwest Territories traditional economy can and will continue to endure, thanks to the hard work of these individuals. The Government of the Northwest Territories will continue to stand with harvesters and trappers, and support them, as part of our efforts to bolster the traditional economy, create employment opportunities in small communities, and increase food security for Northwest Territories residents. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
208,2021-02-25,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-archie-importance-capital-investment-aging-infrastructure,Government Website,Diane Archie: Importance of Capital Investment in Aging Infrastructure,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, the Northwest Territories Power Corporation or NTPC provides an essential service to residents and businesses in the Northwest Territories. Without reliable electricity, many of the activities we take for granted, such as cooking, washing clothes or using our computers would be impossible. It is therefore critical that the Corporation maintains its assets to ensure that electricity is available when it is needed and that it is delivered at an affordable rate. The vast majority of Northwest Territories residents have their homes powered by hydroelectricity. Approximately 75% of the electricity consumed annually is generated by hydroelectricity with the remainder generated by diesel, liquified natural gas and solar. Members will have heard my predecessors and I refer frequently to aging infrastructure and the challenges it creates in maintaining reliability of supply. Many of NTPC’s key assets, particularly its hydro units, are reaching the end of their design life. The Snare and Taltson hydro assets have provided renewable energy to NWT residents and businesses for many decades. NTPC has been able to extend the life of these assets through maintenance and repair but has now reached the point where refurbishment or replacement can no longer be delayed. Reliability will continue to decline if we don’t make significant capital investments soon. The long-term benefit of investment in hydro refurbishments is that these units can then generate clean, reliable electricity for another 40 – 50 years. The long-term health of our hydro system is critical to stabilizing the cost of energy across the NWT. However, we need to manage decisions within an environment of limited resources. NTPC has an extensive capital plan to improve reliability of core assets and support reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as per the 2030 Energy Strategy. Many necessary projects will be financially supported by the Government of Canada through its Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program or ICIP.  NTPC has been allocated over $85 million through ICIP to advance several hydro refurbishments as well as other alternative and renewable energy projects. Given a limited window of opportunity to ensure federal funding support, we recognize that it is far more cost effective to move forward with projects now rather than face ongoing emergency repairs for equipment failures. We recognize that ICIP funding will only partially off-set the costs of these capital investments. Customers and/or taxpayers will be responsible for paying 25% or more of the costs, which will place upward pressure on the cost of energy. NTPC is working with the Department of Infrastructure to identify other sources of funding to help mitigate energy cost increases and to defer non-essential projects. NTPC has developed a Strategic Plan to ensure it maintains it’s focus on lowering electricity rates, improving reliability and meeting its 2030 Energy Strategy commitments.  The Plan is based on four pillars: reliability, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability and innovation. It outlines NTPC’s approach to addressing challenges and identifies potential growth opportunities. There will be some additional short-term capital costs that NTPC will incur, but over the longer term the Strategic Plan will help reduce upward pressure on rates.  This plan will be shared with Members and the public later in the year.  This government understands that the high cost of living is a major concern for NWT residents. Through the 2030 Energy Strategy and NTPC’s Strategic and Capital Plans, we remain focused on our government’s priority to lower the cost of power and increase the use of alternative and renewable energy whenever possible. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
209,2021-02-25,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/fourth-shipment-covid-19-vaccines-expected-week,Government Website,Fourth shipment of COVID-19 vaccines expected this week,"Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services issued the following media statement today as the fourth shipment of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to arrive in the Northwest Territories (NWT) later this week: “Each week, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) reports an updated number of COVID-19 vaccines administered across the territory. As of February 22, 14,520 first doses of the vaccine had been given in the NWT and 1,934 residents have been fully vaccinated with both doses. I believe this data is an important element in our reporting process so NWT residents can understand how far we’ve come and to continue to trust that there is a way out of this pandemic. “Earlier this month, the Federal government reported expected delays in delivery of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to Canada, which in turn temporarily affected rollout in the NWT.  I am proud to report that despite the reduced third vaccine shipment, the NWT continues to lead the way across the country with delivery of first doses and we are on track to receive enough vaccines from the Federal government for 75% of our adult population by the end of March 2021. “Later this week, the NWT is expecting a fourth shipment of the COVID-19 vaccine containing 16,200 doses. The fourth vaccine shipment will be used to continue delivering second doses to priority populations in all NWT communities, as well as first doses for those who missed the initial opportunity. “The fourth shipment will also allow us to start offering the vaccine to residents 18 years of age and older in all NWT communities except for Hay River, Inuvik, and Yellowknife. Priority populations in Hay River, Inuvik, and Yellowknife will be expanded to include additional frontline essential workers who cannot work virtually. “In total, the territory has received 19,100 doses of the vaccine in three shipments from the Federal government since December 2020. The fourth shipment will bring the total number of doses received by the NWT to 35,300. This is a substantial amount and I’d like to thank the Federal government for supporting the NWT and remaining steadfast in its promise to deliver these vaccines to the territory. “All NWT communities have been added to the vaccine schedule at www.nthssa.ca/covid-vaccine. This site is updated regularly as new information becomes available. I encourage residents to check it often, and share this information with their friends and family. “I know many NWT residents are eager to get the vaccine and see things return to the way they were just one year ago. COVID-19 fatigue has set in for many, but I am confident that we remain on the right track and ask NWT residents to hold on a little while longer. Compared to other jurisdictions across Canada, we have been fortunate not to have many cases and are still able to do many of the things we enjoy that are not awarded to residents south of our border. “Now more than ever, it is important that we continue to follow the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer in order to keep our territory safe – even if you have had one or both doses of the vaccine. Keep gatherings small and spaces large, practice physical distancing, wear a mask to help keep you and others safe,  get tested and stay home if you are feeling sick, and when your turn comes - get vaccinated to protect yourself against COVID-19.”"

211,2021-02-24,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-youth-mental-health-supports,Government Website,Julie Green: Youth Mental Health Supports,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, today on Pink Shirt Day we come together to commit to creating safe spaces for each other and for our youth, places where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.  The COVID-19 pandemic has affected us all in significant ways and has highlighted the importance of supporting one another and advocating for those who need help, and for youth in particular. We know that the harms associated with bullying can have devastating and long-lasting impacts on individuals, families, and communities. Having accessible mental health services is critical to support both victims and people who use bullying to heal from the wounds this behavior inflicts.  Mr. Speaker, over the last three years, the Department of Health and Social Services has worked closely with the Department of Education, Culture and Employment on the phased establishment of Child and Youth Care Counsellors in NWT schools and communities.  This approach was informed through engagement with NWT youth who told us they wanted access to confidential and flexible mental health services.  The GNWT is currently in phase three of a four-year implementation plan.  I am pleased to report that staffing these positions is going well. A total of 33 out of 39 child and youth care counsellor positions are been successfully filled through the NWT, along with five Clinical Supervisor positions. The Child and Youth Care Counsellor initiative, in combination with our work to eliminate wait times and establish same day access for counselling supports, has greatly improved access to services for all NWT residents when they need it most.  Mr. Speaker, we have heard from Northerners about the need to provide a variety of options when it comes to mental wellness supports. One of the ways we are expanding options is through the implementation of e-mental health options such as the Strongest Families Institute. A year ago, the GNWT partnered with Bell Let’s Talk and NorthwesTel to have the Strongest Families Institute provide telephone-based support for children and families experiencing mild to moderate anxiety, depression and behavioral concerns.  So far we have seen a positive response to this service, and I would like to share some of the testimonials we received from parents. A parent of a 12-year old said “the coaching was instrumental in teaching me the skills and techniques I needed to feel more in control of my situation, build a stronger relationship with my son and feel hope for the future”. A parent of an 11-year old had the following to say, “My coach with Strongest Families was super helpful, understanding and supportive. She helped me to see and understand parenting on so many levels. The skills and strategies put in place are effective and are definitely worth learning.""  While the pandemic has produced innovation in the area of virtual care, government recognizes that these types of services may not be easily accessible by all.  As a result, staff across the territory are working to ensure that creative solutions are in place to support children and families who may not have access to a phone in their home.  Some of these solutions include making space available within health centres, dropping off packages with information and resources at people’s homes and making use of community partners to ensure information about the availability of services is shared. The Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority now has a the Child and Youth Mental Health Coordinator who is leading the way with several key initiatives that will improve our approach to caring for children and youth with mental health needs. Some of these initiatives include:   working with the Stanton Territorial Pediatric Inpatient Unit to develop inpatient psychiatric admission processes and programing; working with the Stanton team to build care pathways, therapeutic resources, aftercare, and staff capacity; supporting health centre staff across the territory with mental health system navigation and building their skill sets to care for children and youth in need of mental health services; and, leading the implementation of the Northwest Territories partnership with the Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto to improve access to specialized child psychiatric services across NWT  regions and communities.  Mr. Speaker, the Department of Health and Social Services is also working with schools to support the delivery of the Talking About Mental Illness program, TAMI for short.  TAMI is a school-based program focused on increasing awareness and reducing stigma about mental illness. Programs such as this increase comfort talking about mental health and help to increase the likelihood that youth will access help if they need support.  Additionally children and youth can also access the NWT Help Line and the Kids Help Phone  24 hours, 7 days a week for free and confidential support.  Mr. Speaker, there is no single approach that will work for everyone when it comes to addressing youth mental health. But by providing a variety of options we ensure that we are better positioned to support youth when they need it most. I urge each of us, on this Pink Shirt Day, to take the time to consider how we can support and lift each other up. Remember, a little kindness and compassion can go a long way.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
212,2021-02-24,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-pink-shirt-day-0,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Pink Shirt Day,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, we all share in the responsibility of ensuring that our schools and communities are safe spaces. Today, we take a moment to pause and reflect on how each of us contributes to safe spaces where bullying is prevented whenever possible and quickly addressed when it occurs. In 2007, Nova Scotia teenagers David Shepherd and Travis Price organized a protest after a male Grade 9 student in their school was harassed for wearing a pink shirt. The next morning, these two youth brought pink shirts to hand out to all male students. Their school was full of kids in pink that day and 14 years later, Pink Shirt Day has become a global call-to-action as schools and workplaces are flooded with pink in solidarity against bullying. The national theme for 2021 is Lift Each Other Up, and I am happy to see so much pink around the House today, as we stand together on Pink Shirt Day. As I am sure all Members of this House are aware, bullying can occur to anyone, of any age, at any time. It occurs when aggressive and repeated behaviours happen between one or more people in a real or perceived power imbalance. This imbalance can be based on a range of factors from size, age or ethnicity, to religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. No one, from any walk of life, is immune to becoming a bully, or experiencing bullying.  This behaviour has negative impacts on individuals, families and communities. It causes fear, emotional harm and physical, psychological and social distress. We must support victims of bullying, and ensure we provide education and formative consequences to bullies, so they can learn the harm in their actions and repair relationships. Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories has Safe School Regulations that establish a Territorial Code of Conduct and ensure all schools have a Safe School Plan. These plans ensure students from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 take healthy relationship programming, and require schools to address instances of bullying in accordance with the regulations. A Safe School Plan ensures there are structured mechanisms in place for keeping students and staff physically, emotionally, mentally and socially safe. Last year, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment released the Guidelines for Ensuring LGBTQ2S+ Equity, Safety and Inclusion in Northwest Territories Schools.. We continue to support schools in upholding these guidelines and in the development of their Gender Sexuality Alliances through our partnership with the Yellowknife Rainbow Youth Coalition. Mr. Speaker, Northwest Territories schools should be safe and caring environments for the entire school community. We must continue our vigilance to ensure our schools are safe spaces where people respect each other’s differences and recognize each other’s similarities. When we see bullying, we need to speak up; and if we bully others, we must reflect on our actions and seek ways to do better. Let’s lift each other up. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The Government of Northwest Territories (GNWT) reminds residents and commercial drivers to drive safely.  	As cellular coverage is limited along some sections of NWT highways, drivers are encouraged to plan their route in advance and keep someone informed of their travel plans, especially when travelling between communities or far distances. It is recommended that drivers check the weather forecast as well as NWT’s Highway Conditions map, which is updated regularly by the Department of Infrastructure. Drivers are reminded to use traffic pull-outs to stop whenever possible. If you must pull over on an NWT highway, select a straight, flat stretch of road with good visibility in both directions, and use hazard lights to ensure you are visible to other vehicles. Drivers and passengers are strongly encouraged to stay in their vehicle, as drivers may not be able to see them – particularly in the dark. Drivers should slow down when passing stopped vehicles. Drive alert, always scanning for potential hazards. Drivers should adjust their speed to the road and weather conditions and never exceed the posted speed limit. In poor conditions, drivers should leave at least four seconds of space between their vehicle and the vehicle ahead, always giving larger vehicles like trucks and buses more space. Drivers are reminded to only pass a vehicle when permitted, keeping a safe following distance behind the vehicle they intend to pass. It is strongly encouraged that drivers carry a winter survival kit in their vehicles, equipped with essential supplies that will keep them safe if an emergency situation arises. Items to consider for a survival kit: Two-way radio or satellite phone  Sand or other traction aid Tow rope and booster cables Road flares or warning light Reflective clothing Gas line antifreeze Headlamp or flashlight and extra batteries Lighter and matches First aid kit and fire extinguisher Non-perishable energy foods Winter-rated sleeping bag or blanket Ice scraper/snow brush/shovel/axe   As NWT winters are accompanied by extreme cold temperatures and snowy/icy conditions, it’s important that residents adapt to conditions and maintain their vehicles.

214,2021-02-23,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-investments-northwest-territories-agriculture-industry,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Investments in Northwest Territories Agriculture Industry,"Check against delivery Thank you, MP McLeod - and thanks for joining us today, everyone. On first blush, this may seem like an odd time to make an agriculture announcement; especially in the Northwest Territories. The reality is that by the time the weather warms up and people like you and I start thinking about planting and growing, the folks that make up Canada’s commercial food sector - even here in the NWT - will already be wildly busy. It is during this “downtime” that agriculture planning is done, seeds are bought, equipment is prepared and investments are made in the upcoming growing season. It is in this spirit, that we are marking National Agriculture Day – today – by highlighting three key investments that were made during this off-season under the federal Canadian Agriculture Partnership. Specifically, we were pleased, over the winter months, to support three commercial farm businesses in Hay River by investing in their projects to clear new land, build new greenhouses and storage facilities, and invest in new technologies and equipment. Riverside Growers continues to respond to market demand by increasing production capacity and improving processing flow.  In part thanks to the 188 thousand dollars they received in Major Agriculture Projects Fund investment, Riverside Growers will effectively double their growing space while streamlining their processing and packing lines for greater efficiency. Further, Riverside Growers will also be investing in multi-functional processing equipment to support a broader array of products and provide a new level of value-added support for other local producers. Utilizing their 111 thousand dollars of funding, Greenwood Gardens is planning a significant expansion of their greenhouse production enabling them to grow more high value crops including tomatoes and cucumbers. The energy efficient greenhouse will allow for an earlier start and extended growing season particularly important for growing frost sensitive vegetables successfully in the north.  The greenhouse will also provide an ideal climate for high-quality vegetable seedlings and bedding plant production to service the local and region markets. And finally - as we’ll hear from directly Mr.  Kevin Wallington shortly - Choice North Farms has received a 180 thousand dollar investment and is using these funds to relocate and upgrade their on-site inline grading station to increase quality control, improve operational efficiency and open up new markets in the NWT and hopefully, beyond. These investments were made thanks to our continued collaboration with the federal Department of Agriculture Canada in the Canadian Agriculture Partnership.   I want to make a point today of recognizing the Government of Canada for its continued support of this partnership. It represents a five year, $5.6 million-dollar funding commitment that is the foundation of our support and investments in the NWT’s agriculture sector. Since our agriculture strategy was introduced in 2017, the GNWT has invested this funding in planning, training, capacity building, community partnerships and regulatory improvements designed to position the commercial agriculture sector to grow. The GNWT’s Agriculture Strategy is called: The Business of Food- A Food Production Plan. As you might assume from its title, it is a plan focussed on maximizing the economic potential of our agriculture sector. Like many things, however, COVID-19 has shed a new lens on agriculture in the North. The pandemic has exacerbated food security concerns in the NWT placing added emphasis on assisting vulnerable populations – and further illuminated the need for regional economic diversification in our territory. Again, the federal government’s support for food security throughout the pandemic is very much appreciated. Food security is an issue that is foundationally important to the health and wellbeing of the people of the NWT. While I don’t want to side track today’s announcement, I do feel is it important to say this: the GNWT’s mandate includes a commitment to increase food security through locally produced, harvested, and affordable food.  The growth of our agriculture sector is central to this commitment. Increased local food production can and will support the GNWT’s goal to improve food security across the territory. I want to end today by saluting those NWT residents from across the entire territory who organize farmers markets, volunteer at community gardens and greenhouses and respond to the unique challenges of growing food in the North. Most importantly of course on this Canada’s National Agriculture Day, a vote of appreciation to our small and vibrant community of commercial growers and food producers in the NWT who are already planning for the season ahead – and the production of fresh, healthy, safe and more-affordable locally grown food choices. Thank you."

Quotes “COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges, and has put increased focus for Canadians on where they get their food. The pandemic has also highlighted the need to ensure food security for all Canadians. Through this project, the Government of Canada is providing support to innovative solutions that help ensure a dependable food supply in Northwest Territories communities.” 	-Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food “Local food producers in the Northwest Territories play an important role in establishing a resilient food supply for their communities. The funding announced today will help these growers scale-up production to bring more of their safe, nutritious foods to grocery store shelves and kitchen tables across the territory.” -Michael V. McLeod, Member of Parliament for Northwest Territories “When the Government of the Northwest Territories introduced its first agriculture strategy in 2017, we noted that to increase the production of fresh, healthy, safe and affordable locally grown food, we must first establish a commercial food-growing industry.

They will still need to submit a self-isolation plan and exemption request through ProtectNWT and must receive an approved exemption letter from the CPHO before they can be exempt from self-isolation. Anyone who has already arrived in the NWT from Nunavut can also apply for a retroactive exemption by contacting ProtectNWT. This means anyone who has arrived in the NWT and is already self-isolating can still apply for an exemption. If it is approved by the CPHO, that person would no longer have to self-isolate. Travelers applying for an exemption must have been in Nunavut or the NWT for at least the past 14 days. They must also: Not be symptomatic. Not have been named a contact of a COVID-19 diagnosis; or Not have been notified that they were part of a COVID-19 outbreak. Travelers will not be eligible for an exemption in the following circumstances: If they are coming from a community with travel restrictions in place. If they are coming from a community experiencing community spread of COVID-19. If they are coming from a Nunavut closed camp or work site that has out-of-territory workers. Quote “There are strong ties between the NWT and Nunavut. Many of our residents have friends and family in Nunavut and vice-versa. As we continue our rollout of vaccinations and more NWT residents build up immunity to COVID-19, the NWT will continue looking at ways to expand our bubble across the North. Considering exemptions for travelers from Nunavut arriving in the NWT is an important step in this process as we gradually and safely emerge from this pandemic.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick facts Travelers must follow additional conditions set out in the exemption letters during the first 14 days upon arrival to the NWT, such as wearing non-medical masks in public places where social distancing cannot be maintained. Household members of a traveler with an exemption from self-isolation will also be exempt and not need to self-isolate. The CPHO can revoke an exemption at any time or deny a request for exemption or alter conditions based on a current public health risk assessment.

I would like to begin with a brief update on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the Northwest Territories.  As of February 15, we have delivered 13,578 first doses and fully vaccinated 579 residents against COVID-19.  The NWT is still leading the country in the delivery of first doses. These doses are already giving strong protection to 39% of the adult population. We are eagerly awaiting the fourth shipment of vaccine later this month. More vaccine will allow us to continue bringing first and second doses to NWT residents. Since the beginning of our vaccine rollout, we knew that the allotment and delivery of doses were both outside of our control.  Our team has built a flexible vaccine delivery schedule to account for shipment delays, weather, or other logistical challenges.  As I’ve said before, the Federal government has remained strong in its promise to deliver enough vaccine for 75 per cent of the NWT’s eligible population by the end of March 2021.  We are grateful for the allocation of vaccine we have received so far. We will continue to keep the public  informed  through weekly media briefings like this as well as communications channels online, on the radio, in print, and in person.  Residents can check the vaccine schedule at www.NTHSSA.ca/COVID-vaccine for the most up-to-date information.  We are adding dates for communities on a regular basis as vaccine supply and logistics allow. With our current supply, we have begun delivering second doses to priority populations to our small, remote communities this week while also providing first doses to those who missed the vaccine team’s initial visit. We are stepping up our on-the-ground communications during these second visits, especially in NWT official Indigenous languages, to ensure we are reaching as many residents as possible. In order to help NWT residents feel comfortable and informed about what to expect during the COVID-19 vaccine clinics, we are also launching a new video series this week that features Tłı̨chǫ Nurse Leanne Mantla and her mother, elder Rose Mantla. Both Leanne and Rose are experienced health care workers from the NWT whose trusted voices explain what to expect before, during, and after the clinic arrives in each community. Residents will be able to find these videos in English, French, and Tłı̨chǫ on the GNWT Corporate Facebook pages, or on the COVID-19 website.  On that website the public will find wastewater test results. The GNWT has updated the COVID-19 dashboard to display wastewater results by community and include all results from the time sampling started.  There are currently six NWT communities where wastewater surveillance is being conducted: Fort Simpson, Fort Smith, Hay River, Inuvik, Norman Wells and Yellowknife. The Chief Public Health Officer has implemented a wastewater surveillance program in these communities to help detect the presence of COVID-19. Testing wastewater is a cost-effective way to test for the virus and an early warning system to detect COVID-19 in our communities. The program will be in place for the next six to 18 months depending on the status of the pandemic and the role this surveillance activity has in informing the response by public health. This testing is a collaboration between community governments, and the departments of Environment and Natural Resources, Municipal and Community Affairs, Health and Social Services, and the Public Health Agency of Canada, including the National Microbiology Laboratory.  I’d now like to make a few more points about where we are at with COVID-19. First, I’d like to acknowledge how much NWT residents have sacrificed in the last 11 months to protect our territory from COVID-19. As March Break nears, I know many would like to travel outside the territory.  Transmission rates across Canada are still high and the impact of variants is alarming because they are more infectious than the original strain. As a result, non-essential travel outside the territory is still not recommended right now. Let’s take this time to see how much there is to do right here in the NWT.  Get out on the land. Go skating. Go cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, ice-fishing, and snowshoeing.  If you must travel, awareness is key.  There are currently significant outbreaks in many areas where NWT residents would routinely travel for medical or other reasons.  Knowing the COVID-19 situation in your destination before you travel will allow you to make informed decisions about your own health and safety. Residents can find travel advice and more information about COVID-19 hotspots in nearby regions and the rest of Canada on the GNWT covid website.  So far, the COVID-19 cases within our own territory have been contained because Northerners are taking the proper steps to keep their communities safe.  But, we have seen how quickly one case can become an outbreak.  We must continue to follow the guidance that has kept us safe these past 11 months. Keep gatherings small and spaces large; Practice physical distancing and stay six feet or two metres apart; Wash your hands and do it a lot; Keep sneezing and coughing to yourself; Wear a mask to help keep you and others safe; and get get tested and stay home if you are feeling sick. Together, we can defeat COVID-19. Thank you."
224,2021-02-17,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/premier-cochrane-bi-weekly-media-event,Government Website,"Premier Cochrane, Bi-Weekly Media Event ","Check against delivery  Good morning. Thank you all for being here today. With me are Minister Julie Green, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola, and Territorial Medical Director Dr. AnneMarie Pegg.  Since the beginning of 2021, our government has been hard at work putting into action a vaccination strategy that has been one of the most aggressive campaigns in the history of the Northwest Territories. We have always said that our main priority during this pandemic has been to protect residents and communities, especially those who are most vulnerable to the virus. The efforts of our health care professionals who have helped to vaccinate residents in all 33 of our communities, some of the most remote in Canada, has been nothing but impressive. The work undertaken by Dr. Pegg and the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority is helping us to protect our loved ones and positions us where we can begin to look at life post-pandemic, which includes our social and economic recovery.  However, I must continue to impress upon residents that even if you have your first dose of the vaccine, our work is not quite done. It’s important we don’t let our guard down just yet. Even if a significant number of residents have been vaccinated, we still need to protect those around us who have not yet or cannot get the vaccine. While the vaccination plan is progressing as planned, we all need to continue to do our part and follow the public health orders, wear a mask, wash our hands, and keep a safe distance. As we have seen with the outbreak at the Gahcho Kue mine, it can only take a few cases to cause the need for strict measures to be undertaken. I want to thank De Beers Canada and Mountain Province Diamonds for their swift efforts to limit further spread of the virus, and am confident they will continue to ensure they are vigorously testing their employees, and working to limit the spread of COVID-19. I also want to thank all the businesses and residents who have continued to work to keep us all safe.   It is not lost on the government that these are trying times for everyone. The pressure the pandemic is placing on residents and businesses is apparent, and pandemic fatigue has been setting in for many of us.  We are approaching the one-year mark since the beginning of the pandemic. It has been one of the most difficult times many of us have faced and it has had an impact on personal and emotional well-being of us all. This a difficult time for everyone, and the increased pressure the pandemic has put on each of us should not be ignored. Self-care is so important, and I encourage everyone who may be feeling down to reach out to friends, family or to the NWT Helpline at 1-800-661-0844 for support. I have said it many times, but one of the lasting legacies of COVID-19 will be how we treated one another, and I encourage all NWT residents to support those who are having a difficult time. We all play an important role to encourage a society where we can all talk more openly about how we are feeling. We need to work together to affect change around the attitudes and stigma that exists – and this starts with being kind to one another. I’d now like to turn it over to Minister Green to provide her remarks. "
225,2021-02-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/news-release-fort-good-hope-seniors-centre-opens,Government Website,News Release – Fort Good Hope Seniors Centre Opens,"FORT GOOD HOPE (February 16 2021) – Paulie Chinna, Minister Responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation (NWTHC) and Julie Green, Minister Responsible for Seniors, are pleased to announce the completion of the Fort Good Hope Seniors Centre – a supported independent living complex for Northwest Territories (NWT) seniors.   The completion of this building will allow for the provision of supports to seniors in Fort Good Hope so that they can remain in their community as they age, surrounded by friends and family. Enabling seniors to age in place with dignity is a mandate priority of the 19th Legislative Assembly and requires a whole-of-government approach that crosses many departments. This new nine-plex building is the last of five complexes constructed across the NWT that were designed in collaboration with the Department of Health and Social Services with input from the community.  The seniors’ nine-plex includes features that will assist residents in their day-to-day living. Some of these supports include no-step entrances to suites, wider doorways and a main floor bathroom, two barrier free units and a caretaker’s unit. A common space can be used for the delivery of Health and Social Services programming. With the population of seniors in the NWT set to increase in coming years, the housing corporation is investing in seniors’ independent housing facilities that will support aging in place. Quotes “The Housing Corporation and the GNWT are committed to helping seniors stay in their home communities for as long as possible.  A crucial part of ensuring the health and well-being of our elders is housing and I am pleased to have worked with the community leadership and local businesses to work on this project.  Together we are ensuring our elders can stay in their home communities, surrounded by their family, friends and familiar supports.”   Paulie Chinna, Minister Responsible for the NWT Housing Corporation and Minister Responsible for Addressing Homelessness “NWT seniors are valued and loved members of our communities and families and the GNWT wants to make sure they are able to live safe, independent lives and stay connected to the people they love.” Julie Green, Minister Responsible for Seniors   Quick Facts The GNWT has designed five of these seniors nine-plex units that support aging-in-place. These units are located in Aklavik, Fort Liard, Fort Good Hope, Fort McPherson, and Whatı̀. All are now complete and operational. The NWTHC is also increasing supports for seniors to stay in their homes and communities by amending NWTHC policies.  Under these changes, the assessment of household income for homeownership programs will only consider the incomes of the applicant and co-applicant. In the past, this assessment included the incomes of all income earners in the household.  In rural and remote communities, having insurance and land tenure is no longer a requirement to access NWTHC home repair programs.   In addition to Minister Chinna and Minister Green, MLA Cleveland (Kam Lake) also attended the opening.

229,2021-02-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-workers-safety-and-compensation-commission-service-innovations-during-covid,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Workers’ Safety and Compensation  Commission Service Innovations during COVID-19,"Mr. Speaker, today I wish to provide an update on some of the service improvements, including the financial relief measures the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.  When the pandemic hit, the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission responded quickly to adapt its operations. In line with public health guidance, all employees in Yellowknife, Inuvik and Iqaluit were swiftly equipped with the right technology, moved to work from home, and safely transitioned back to offices once appropriate safety measures were put in place. Since March 2020, the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission has successfully maintained services to 4,000 employers and almost 40,000 workers in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut without significant interruption. A commendable achievement.  Mr. Speaker, one of the ways the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission continues to ensure business continuity and to enhance frontline services for employers and injured workers is by offering virtual and online alternatives. Prior to the pandemic, work was already well underway to expand online options, such as Mine Supervisor Certification and e-business services offered through WSCC Connect. However, it is undeniable that the practical challenges posed by COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of some digital platforms and business transformation through sheer necessity.  The Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission has taken a highly flexible and adaptive approach. For example, claims services are working with service providers in healthcare to address some of the practical barriers to providing virtual‐based care plan options for injured workers.  In suitable cases, services offered have ranged from medical appointment follow-ups, counselling, physiotherapy home exercise plans and assessments, and Vocational Rehabilitation assessments and follow-up. These improvements are in the early days and, though modest, are meaningful and will ultimately offer a more supportive and responsive service for injured workers and their families, a quicker resolution for employers, and a reduction in claims costs. Mr. Speaker, Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission educational outreach and inspections are important parts of ensuring the health and safety of workplaces across the Northwest Territories. In 2020, the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission adapted these in-person activities and provided assistance to over 2,760 employers through alternative means such as phone and online. Educational tools and guidance were developed and rolled out for industry use and the webinars and Zoom meetings that replaced annual events with partner organizations and professional associations were well attended.  Inspections are an essential mechanism for accountability to ensure that employers are meeting their legal obligations under the Safety Act and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations and the Mine Health and Safety Act. Engagement and outreach gives employers access to guidance and best practice tools so they can create and maintain strong safety plans and also ensures the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission remains responsive to the challenges they face.  Mr. Speaker, the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission is also making continual improvements to the more established e-business services on WSCC Connect. A new service for employers to report workplace safety incidents or injuries was recently launched on the platform.  Employer’s Report of Incident joins existing services, such as payroll reporting, online payments, assessment rates information, clearance requests and report of unsafe work. For example, employers who reduced their workforce during the pandemic had the opportunity to submit a revised payroll estimate online and to make their payments without penalty at a later date.  At this challenging time for many businesses, the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission announced last November that the average rate for employer assessments will be maintained at the 2020 rate levels. Employers have already received notification of their industry assessment rates. That the average rate is holding steady at $2.40 per $100 of assessable payroll is positive news at a time of economic uncertainty for so many. The Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission remains committed to making Northern workplaces the safest in the country, to delivering care to injured workers, to working collaboratively with the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer to reduce the risk of exposure and transmission of COVID-19 in workplaces and to providing practical support to employers and local businesses to operate safely.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The Department of Health and Social Services is improving services to individuals with addictions and I am committed to achieving this mandate commitment.   In the Northwest Territories, mental health and addictions are a pressing concern for all of us. While there are supports and services already in place and available, we know we need to further strengthen our system to help those who are struggling most. This is particularly true when it comes to addictions recovery supports.    Mr. Speaker, our goal is to ensure quality addictions recovery services meet the needs of our residents, but in order to understand best what these individuals need, we need to hear from them. Hearing from individuals who have personally experienced, or had a family member experience, addictions will best inform our approach.  The GNWT knows that one size doesn’t fit all when it comes to mental health and addictions, and it’s important that residents are provided options as they move towards recovery.   Our first step towards gathering this information and better understanding these needs will be to conduct an Addictions Recovery Survey which will focus on hearing from people about programs and services they have accessed in the past. We want to learn what has worked, what has not, and what residents feel they need to support their recovery.  The GNWT will be asking its partners, including service providers, for their support in sharing the survey with clients, as well as using traditional and social media to raise awareness. Hardcopies of the survey will also be available for those who are unable to access the online version at their local community counselling program office and treatment facilities.   Mr. Speaker, a key component of this survey will be to focus on barriers or challenges experienced by people seeking help.  We need to understand what gets in the way of recovery so we can work to overcome it.  We need to understand what works best when it comes to supporting recovery so we can do more of it.  This survey is a critical first step towards this understanding and it will be followed by more focused efforts where we can dive deeper into lived experiences to shape our plans moving forward.    The GNWT is also moving forward by developing an NWT Alcohol Strategy. The intent of this strategy is to reduce alcohol-related harms. Alcohol-related harms refers to a wide range of impacts associated with heavy or risky alcohol use, including chronic health problems, injuries, violence, lost productivity, criminal justice issues, family problems, and death.   The development of the Alcohol Strategy will be informed by feedback from stakeholders and led by a team of professionals that understand outreach and engagement, addiction medicine and treatment, and include representatives from GNWT departments, and evaluation and surveillance experts to ensure measureable results.   Mr. Speaker, I am looking forward to reviewing the feedback received from residents and service users about the effectiveness of the addictions recovery supports we provide.   The GNWT wants to ensure that services offered are to meet our commitment to provide appropriate choice, cultural safety and person-centered care. These elements are incredibly important to the effectiveness of services and I look forward to sharing the results of the survey with Members as one way to fulfill our mandate commitment to assist residents with addictions recovery   Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Simpson: Aurora College Transformation Update,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, when this Government committed to establishing a polytechnic university we did so with the promise that we would be transparent in the process. Guided by the NWT Post-Secondary Education Framework, there were a number of key documents released last fall that explain the process of transformation and those documents, the Implementation Plan and Areas of Specialization for the polytechnic university, continue to guide the process. But transparency does not stop there. Mr. Speaker, in October we launched the Aurora College Transformation ACT web pages to meet that promise of transparency and accountability, and visitors to the site can track the progress of the transformation.

The report illustrates the number of key milestones that were completed in 2020 and key milestones that are planned for the duration of the transformation. It shows how many milestones are completed, in progress, and not yet started in addition to highlights from each area of focus. Mr. Speaker, Indigenous governments, the public, our partners, and key stakeholders can expect to see this level of transparency and accountability in quarterly reports until we launch the polytechnic university. Between publication dates, those interested can track our progress on the Aurora College Transformation web pages to get monthly updates on specific milestones, on engagement opportunities and to learn more about the transformation in general. Mr. Speaker, 2020 was an important year for the transformation and many critical milestones were completed and many key documents were developed and released. In 2021, there are two critical milestones scheduled: amendments to the Aurora College Act and the development of the first ever 3-year academic plan. There is also a great deal of work taking place on the other 106 milestones currently planned. That is why we have created the Quarterly Report, with an initiative as important as the transformation, it is important to celebrate all of our successes. Mr. Speaker, our commitment to transform Aurora College into a sustainable, effective and efficient polytechnic university will provide more post-secondary education opportunities for residents, right here in the territory.  Those opportunities will include increased access to learning in every community, laddered programming from literacy to upgrading to certificate to degree, and new programs in the coming years that are aligned with the polytechnic university’s areas of specialization.  All of these changes are to ensure that Northerners are first in line for in-demand jobs and that we can leverage our strong connections to land, tradition, community and people.  Mr. Speaker, in addition, the successful transformation to a polytechnic university will result in significant and wide-ranging economic recovery for the NWT, including preparing Northerners for employment; supporting business by supporting changing labour demands; expansion of infrastructure; development of co-investment partnerships; focusing on finding innovative solutions to Northern issues and capitalizing on Northern opportunities.    Mr. Speaker, the Quarterly Report delivers on our promise to be transparent and accountable.

234,2021-02-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/covid-19-health-and-social-services-system-response-update,Government Website,COVID-19 Health and Social Services System Response Update,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged us all in many ways but none of us more so than within the health and social services system. The protection of our residents is our number one priority. In order to meet the challenge, our system quickly mobilized a number of critical pieces that enabled our territory to respond effectively to the pandemic.  We did this through the implementation of decisive public health measures and a coordinated approach to health services. We provided the necessary testing, tracing and care to manage cases and make best use of our limited health resources.  The public health measures and orders put in place by the Chief Public Health Officer and the diligence of our residents and businesses in following them has meant that we have been able to contain cases in the NWT. These measures have not been easy and have had a significant impact on everyone, but we have been successful in protecting our residents from the spread of COVID-19 and avoiding the return to more stringent measures. Mr. Speaker, the expansion of territory testing and analysis within the territory has been critical in order to respond quickly to positive cases and implement the necessary care and safety precautions to individuals and community members.  We now have rapid point of care testing capacity in all of our community health centres, which can deliver initial results in as little as 15 minutes. Confirmatory testing is completed using the “gold standard” Polymerase Chain Reaction testing methodology at the Stanton and Inuvik hospital lab sites, significantly improving turnaround times to an average of 24 to 48 hours. Mr. Speaker, wastewater testing has proven to be an effective early warning system detecting COVID-19 in our communities.  To date we have implemented this testing in Yellowknife, Hay River, Fort Simpson, Inuvik and Fort Smith. This surveillance program is a collaborative effort between community governments, Environment and Natural Resources, Municipal and Community Affairs, Health and Social Services, and the Public Health Agency of Canada. Wastewater testing has enabled us to detect COVID-19 in Yellowknife, Fort Smith and Hay River. When we identify positive results, public health officials begin contact tracing and implementing other essential public health prevention measures to manage the spread of COVID-19. We saw how this works last month as part of the public health response to contain the cluster of COVID-19 cases in Fort Liard. When wastewater testing in Hay River picked up a positive viral signal, we launched a coordinated response that included enhanced sewage surveillance, targeted testing for people who had been self-isolating, and dedicated clinics and extended hours to test individuals for COVID-19. When the source of infection was traced to Fort Liard, a rapid response team was immediately deployed to assist with contact tracing, self-isolation logistics and other essential tasks to contain the virus and help protect vulnerable people.  Mr. Speaker, the responses to prevent exposure and transmission of COVID-19 among our residents have had unintended impacts on our mental health and sense of well-being.  The health and social services system is committed to assist residents to cope with these impacts through improved service delivery, community partnerships and ongoing communications. Some of the actions that we have taken to support individuals and families include providing short-term financial support to families who cannot get assistance from other GNWT programs; and providing services to vulnerable residents in Yellowknife, Inuvik and Hay River. We have also increased the frequency of our advertising campaign to raise awareness of the availability of key services like family violence shelters, community counselling programs and help lines. To support residents with mental health or addictions concerns, we established the territorial COVID Navigator in partnership with 8-1-1 and ProtectNWT. The COVID Navigator can help residents connect or reconnect with the appropriate health and social services resources, including their local community counselling program. Mr. Speaker, in closing, on behalf of Cabinet, I want to thank residents and businesses for staying the course, for following the public health orders and for coming forward for COVID-19 testing when asked through the public health advisories.  Our current success would not be possible without the commitment made by every resident of the NWT. I am impressed and inspired by the resiliency of Northerners. I also want to provide thanks to all the health and social services staff. The response to this crisis is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all these professionals to protect the health and safety of NWT residents.   I am asking residents to continue to follow the recommended measures to keep us protected while we work through the vaccine roll out. Please continue to practice the healthy habits that we know work to stop the spread of COVID-19. These measures include self-isolating when required, staying home if you are sick, getting tested at the first sign of symptoms, wearing a mask when you’re out, washing your hands frequently, and keeping a safe distance from others, even if you have had your vaccine. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The swift resolution to the recent cluster of COVID-19 cases in Fort Liard demonstrates how powerful those partnerships can be. All partners in last month’s pandemic response worked together to quickly and effectively implement the orders of the territory’s Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to help avert what could have become a widespread outbreak of COVID-19. The GNWT response team thanked community residents for their commitment to adhering to public health orders, noting this cooperation was equally essential to controlling viral transmission in Fort Liard. Before the CPHO issued a 14-day Containment Order in Fort Liard late on January 16, the GNWT pandemic response team had already taken several critical early steps: The GNWT reached out to Indigenous government and community leadership to initiate a coordinated response. The community of Fort Liard and GNWT emergency management teams began working together. Fort Liard health centre staff were joined by a Rapid Response Team deployed to the community by the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority (NTHSSA) to help with testing, contact tracing, and monitoring. The COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat deployed additional Public Health Officers to support the response, including education and enforcement. The Department of Municipal and Community Affairs (MACA) provided a coordination role for Regional Emergency Response Committee work in Fort Liard. MACA also deployed staff to the community to provide on-the-ground communications and coordination support to aid residents and the response to public health orders. Secretariat Communications staff prepared specific radio advertising and posters to inform, engage and encourage residents to strictly adhere to public health measures to contain the virus. A previously-scheduled COVID-19 vaccine clinic went ahead at the end of January with enthusiastic participation by residents. Together, community leadership and the GNWT collaborated to activate emergency management operations to address the needs of Fort Liard, including: Gift cards for groceries and supplies Food and supply delivery to isolators Transportation for staff and residents needing testing Lodging for Rapid Response Team members and those needing isolation Communications efforts – including those in South Slavey and a partnership with CKLB Radio for the nine-day territory-wide Dear Fort Liard support campaign. In a crisis, information is power. To ensure everyone had a common understanding of the situation, the Hamlet and the GNWT worked together and shared daily updates on operations, communications and public health investigations and on-the-ground risk mitigation measures. Quotes “Leaders lead best when we lead together – and we saw that in action in Fort Liard. It’s why collaboration and partnership are an important priority for this government.  By putting these principles into action and working collaboratively we contained a very difficult situation in Fort Liard. The GNWT is committed to protecting residents as we continue to navigate the pandemic, and this is best achieved by partnerships with Indigenous and municipal leadership.” - Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories, and Minister Responsible for the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat  ""To respond to clusters and outbreaks, trust is essential. Trust allows people to feel safe in coming forward, getting tested, and making the sacrifices necessary to push back on tough situations. Local  leadership helped ensure that trust was there when health services arrived on-the-ground. With that foundation, we were able to successfully contain COVID-19 while getting vaccines into arms in Fort Liard.” -Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services “Working in partnership with community governments and its leaders creates strong, healthy communities where all residents can thrive and live well. The successful containment of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Fort Liard demonstrates what is possible when governments work in partnership with the best interests of the community and its residents at heart.” -Paulie Chinna, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs “While the recent events in Fort Liard were worrisome and unfortunate, they did demonstrate something I’ve long known – when governments and community leadership all pull together in the same direction, we’re able to serve our people best. I’d like to thank all of our response partners, and perhaps most importantly, the residents of Liard, for their cooperation, diligence and swift action. It’s because of this action, our people are now safe.” -Shane Thompson, Member of the Legislative Assembly for Nehendeh “Leadership is not a position or a title. It's about having the ability to lead with immediate action to guide one another on the importance of working together to implement unity and safety during difficult times. I would like to commend our residents for taking immediate action to be tested, complying with our 2-week containment order, and successfully vaccinating 85% of our community. We will continue to work to the best of our ability to keep our residents safe. Please remember to be kind to one another and stay safe.” - Hilary Deneron, Mayor, Fort Liard Quick facts The territory’s Emergency Management Office worked with regional and local emergency management staff to coordinate aid to residents in Fort Liard. The COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat and MACA deployed additional staff to the community to assist with logistics and enforcement. Daily updates in both English and South Slavey were broadcast on community radio throughout the first week of the containment order – and additional public health and supportive messaging was also placed. The GNWT worked with the Hamlet to secure interpreters to record messages in South Slavey. Situational updates were shared daily through the first 10 days of the containment order. The GNWT partnered with CKLB to deliver a social marketing campaign called #DearFortLiard to encourage support and solidarity from across the territory for Fort Liard residents.

237,2021-02-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/gnwt-taking-action-against-unauthorized-occupancy-public-land,Government Website,GNWT is taking action against unauthorized occupancy of public land,"The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is committed to managing public land responsibly and recognizes that unauthorized occupancy – or “squatting” - is a long-standing land management issue across the NWT.  Today, Minister Shane Thompson announced the Department of Lands’ new approach to addressing unauthorized occupants and outlined steps the Department is taking to address untenured structures. In developing the approach, the GNWT made a distinction between structures that were constructed before April 1, 2014 (the date the transfer of responsibility for public land management in the Northwest Territories from the federal department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) to the GNWT took effect) and those built after that date. Structures constructed after April 1, 2014 without proper authorization have been, and will continue to be, subject to the legal process for removal. While the Department will be posting all untenured structures, those built before April 1st, 2014 will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine possible eligibility for tenure. If the structures do not meet the Department’s evaluation criteria for a lease, further enforcement action will be taken, which can include the legal process to seek removal of the structures.  The GNWT recognizes that some untenured cabins may be associated with Indigenous occupants who are exercising their asserted or established Aboriginal or treaty rights. We refer to these as ‘potential rights-based cabins’. The Department is working with Indigenous governments and organizations (IGOs) to identify and confirm which untenured structures are potential rights-based cabins and we have developed a process for occupants wishing to assert their untenured cabins are ancillary to the exercise of their asserted or established Aboriginal or Treaty rights. For more information please visit http://www.gov.nt.ca/needalease Quote “Unauthorized occupancy has been an issue in the North for over 50 years, and one we are now taking action to address. Requiring people to get the right authorizations to use our public land is an important part of how the land is managed, but so is enforcing those requirements. This plan is about making a difference for residents of the NWT, and bringing about transparency and accountability for access and use of public land for everyone.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Lands Quick facts It is estimated there are around 700 untenured structures on public land. Unauthorized occupancy – or “squatting” – is a long-standing land management issue across the NWT and has been for over 50 years. The Department will be posting all untenured structures with a first posting notice. The Department has a process in place for individuals who assert their cabin is ancillary to the exercise of an asserted or established Aboriginal or Treaty right.   Information on this process is included with the first posting notice.

238,2021-02-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-unauthorized-occupancy,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Unauthorized Occupancy ,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, last fall I spoke to you about how enforcing the rules on how public land is used is a critical part of making sure that land and resources in the Northwest Territories are well-managed. We know that unauthorized occupancy or squatting is a longstanding land management issue across the Northwest Territories and has been for over 50 years. The Government of the Northwest Territories has taken steps to address this issue since taking over the responsibilities for land management after devolution. Last fall, I highlighted that we have stepped up our enforcement efforts to act upon all unauthorized occupants identified since devolution. The Department often receives reports of unauthorized occupancy from the public. We appreciate these reports and follow-up on the information provided, taking legal action toward removal where appropriate. Today I am here to share with you the approach that the Department of Lands is taking to address the historic unauthorized use of public land.  Specifically, 	Mr. Speaker, I would like to share our plan to address the unauthorized structures that have existed outside of the built-up area of communities since before devolution. It is now time to take action to tackle this difficult issue within the life of the 19th Legislative Assembly.    Unauthorized cabins built before April 1, 2014 will all be evaluated on a case by case basis against standard criteria. These criteria are based on our land management practices, legislation and policy, and include items such as how far a cabin has to be from the water and highways, the maximum footprint and size of the buildings, and whether or not the land is available. If the structures do not meet the criteria, the Department will initiate legal action to seek removal.  If the structures meet the criteria, the occupant may be able to apply for a lease, which will then undergo consultation with Indigenous governments and organizations. Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember, the Government of the Northwest Territories does not condone the unauthorized use of land. From the outset, the Government of the Northwest Territories has recognized that some untenured cabins, both new and old, may be associated with Indigenous occupants who are exercising their asserted or established Aboriginal or treaty rights. We will continue to work with occupants and Indigenous governments and organizations to identify and confirm these potential rights-based cabins. These cabins will not be subject to current evaluation or further legal action at this time. Instead, the Department will continue to work with Indigenous governments and organizations to identify these structures and work toward an appropriate process for potential rights-based cabins in future. This is a separate but important stream of work that I have committed to work on collaboratively with Indigenous governments. As Lands Inspectors post initial notices on all untenured cabins across the Northwest Territories, occupants who receive notices are encouraged to follow-up with the Department directly. Contact information, as well as information on how to identify if a cabin may be associated with an Aboriginal or treaty right, will be attached to the initial posting notice and available on the Department’s website. Mr. Speaker, this is a big undertaking and it will take time.  We estimate there are upwards of 700 untenured structures on public land, and it will take time to reach every untenured structure on public land across the Northwest Territories.  We are getting tough on those who are breaking the law and who have no legal right to build on public land, but we also need to follow due process and do it right. We also need to ensure the process respects Aboriginal and treaty rights. The Government of the Northwest Territories recognizes the need for residents to access and enjoy the land, now more than ever. This plan is about making a difference for residents of Northwest Territories and to bring about transparency and accountability for access and use of public land for everyone. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
239,2021-02-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-ongoing-service-delivery-and-operation-improvements-covid-19-coordinating,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Ongoing Service Delivery and Operation  Improvements  COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, when the Government of the Northwest Territories established the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat, we committed to bringing our pandemic services under one roof to improve our services and seek cost-efficiencies. I am proud to stand here today and say we have done what we said we would do. Jurisdictions that established travel restrictions, and made early efforts to protect their residents, have shown the most success in limiting the number of COVID-19 cases as the second wave has forced many jurisdictions into lockdowns, and implementing stricter measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, we have not.  Despite a record high number of cases around the world, a surging second wave, and recent new variants, our territory continues to successfully contain COVID-19, due in large part to residents and businesses doing their part and following the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer. Our government’s proactive move to establish the Secretariat has also played a significant role in our ability to limit the spread of the virus in the Northwest Territories. Consolidating the government’s pandemic response has allowed the Secretariat to view operations through a wide-angle lens. The result, Mr. Speaker, is coordinated and improved pandemic services that thousands of residents have relied on during the pandemic. This has allowed us to protect the health and well-being of our communities and the integrity of our health care system. The Secretariat has been able to expand services, purchase in volume for efficiencies, and more effectively support communities and the health care response led by the Chief Public Health Officer. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share some examples of the operational efficiencies, coordinated services and communications expertise the Secretariat has brought to the GNWT’s pandemic response. The GNWT amalgamated our Compliance and Enforcement Operations into a single entity from what used to be three departments. This allowed us to move to dedicated, full-time officers, which has increased the effectiveness of Compliance and Enforcement functions. Our ProtectNWT and 8-1-1 Info Line operations have been combined into one business area to deliver more efficient and consistent services, greatly decreasing the wait time for individuals requesting services. Expanded software and technological capacity now allow us to route telephone calls to employees whose skillsets and expertise are most relevant to questions. In November, we announced that we would change our approach to who pays for isolation centres. We heard from Indigenous leaders, community governments, the business sector, and residents that we needed to find a way to reduce these costs, which made up half of the Secretariat’s budget. The new policy, which came into effect in January, requires residents to pay for isolation centre stays resulting from discretionary travel. Since this change, we have seen a significant decrease in isolation centre stays, which in turn means a considerably reduced expenditure for taxpayers. We recently completed a transparent public tendering process and awarded 76 Standing Offer Agreements to NWT businesses provide lodging, transportation, food services and security to isolation centres.  These agreements will allow us to better serve guest needs and involve more northern businesses in delivering our services while reducing costs. Mr. Speaker, the people and businesses of the NWT are resilient and have found ways to adapt during the pandemic. The Secretariat has positively contributed to our government’s ability to better protect NWT residents and safeguard our economy, while allowing other departments to focus on their mandates and continue to deliver on the important priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
240,2021-02-09,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-nwt-climate-change-council,Government Website,Shane Thompson: NWT Climate Change Council,"Check against delivery  Mr. Speaker, strengthening the government’s leadership and authority on climate change, ensuring climate change impacts are specifically considered when making government decisions, and increasing the use of alternative and renewable energy are mandate priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly. Climate change continues to be a critical issue facing us today and is affecting the Northwest Territories in many ways. That is why the Government of the Northwest Territories is taking real action to address climate change through implementing the NWT Climate Change Strategic Framework 2019-2023 Action Plan. One of the commitments the Government of the Northwest Territories made to strengthen our leadership and authority on climate change is to establish the NWT Climate Change Council. I am pleased to say we have made progress on that commitment with the finalizing of the Council’s Terms of Reference. Mr. Speaker, the Climate Change Council will be a forum for information sharing, collaboration and engagement between representatives of Indigenous governments and organizations, community governments, and the Government of the Northwest Territories. It will provide guidance and advice to inform Government of the Northwest Territories climate change and environment programs. The Council and the Government of the Northwest Territories will also be advised by industry, non-government organizations, co-management bodies and academia. Mr. Speaker, not only has the Government of the Northwest Territories worked to establish the Climate Change Council, we also released our first progress reports on our territory-wide approach to climate change in January. Environment and Natural Resources, the lead department for climate change, along with the departments of Infrastructure and Finance, jointly released four reports: ENR’s NWT Climate Change Action Plan Annual Report Infrastructure’s NWT Energy Initiatives Report Finance’s NWT Carbon Tax Report; and ENR’s Plain Language Overview Report summarizing our government and partners’ activities to address climate change. The reports will collectively help keep our residents informed on the progress we are making on this important issue. We are making progress. Almost all action items under the Climate Change Action Plan are underway and we are well-positioned to continue to transition to a lower-carbon economy, improve knowledge of climate change impacts, and build resilience and adapt to climate change.   Mr.  Speaker, another mandate commitment our government has made significant progress on is ensuring climate change impacts are specifically considered when making government decisions. Then Executive Council and Financial Management Board decision-making instruments have been updated to ensure climate change factors are considered and documented, as applicable, in decisions moving forward. This is a substantial milestone, as the Northwest Territories is one of only a few jurisdictions in Canada to include climate change considerations in its government decision-making processes. This means that going forward Cabinet and Financial Management Board decision papers, submissions and legislative proposals will include climate change factors for consideration. Integrating climate change considerations will improve accountability in Government of the Northwest Territories decision-making processes. Mr. Speaker, Northwest Territories residents are profoundly impacted by climate change and the Government of the Northwest Territories must show leadership in addressing its impacts and opportunities. By working together, both within our departments and with our partners, we can transition to a lower carbon economy;  strengthen our understanding of the effects of climate change; and build resilience and adapt to a changing climate now and for future generations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
241,2021-02-09,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-nwt,Government Website,Julie Green: COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout in the NWT ,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, today I am going to provide an update on COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the Northwest Territories. As Members are aware, the NWT started delivering the COVID-19 vaccine to priority residents on December 31, 2020. Rollout began only a week after Health Canada approved the use of the Moderna vaccine in Canada, and only three days after the territory received its first shipment. Since the beginning, the GNWT’s approach to delivering the COVID-19 vaccine has been grounded in five core values: equity, cultural competency, evidence-based decision-making, flexibility, and trust. These values are outlined in detail in Immunity for our Communities: The Northwest Territories COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy, which was released on January 5, 2021. Department of Health and Social Services and Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority staff have worked alongside local health care staff and community members to bring vaccines to residents across the North. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to share that the NWT has delivered 12,833 first doses and fully vaccinated 299 residents against COVID-19. I also want to highlight that our vaccine teams visited all 33 communities in just under a month. Given the significant logistical and geographical challenges of this rollout, not to mention the cold chain requirements of the vaccine, this is an incredible achievement. Throughout this process, the GNWT has made every effort to translate our vaccine communications into all 11 official languages, through informative handouts, videos, or audio on local community radio stations. Local interpreters, knowledge keepers, and community leaders have been offered to be champions of the vaccine campaign and encourage its uptake. Mr. Speaker, we continue to meet with Indigenous and community governments on a regular basis to keep them informed of our progress with vaccine delivery and listen to the needs of their communities. In line with our reporting to the Public Health Agency of Canada, vaccine dose data continues to be updated weekly on the GNWT COVID-19 website. Helpful information and resources can also be found there including videos, fact sheets, and frequently asked questions about the vaccine. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Cabinet, I would like to take this opportunity to thank local health care staff, travelling vaccine teams, communities and residents for making our vaccine delivery so successful to date. One of three NWT adults has already received their first dose. With every dose given in the NWT, we boost our territory’s defense against COVID-19. The NWT is leading the country with our ambitious delivery of first doses and has recently been commended by the federal Deputy Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Howard Njoo, who stated: “given the geography and the challenges of our winter weather, it is a credit to everyone involved in the vaccine rollout that it is progressing well and on track.” We would also like to express our gratitude to the federal government for their generous allotment of vaccine we have received to date. Despite the recent announcement of the temporary delay of Moderna shipments to Canada, the NWT remains well positioned to receive enough vaccine for 75% of the adult population by the end of March 2021. We knew that the allotment and delivery of doses were both outside of our control, which is why our team built a flexible vaccine delivery schedule to account for shipment delays, weather, or other logistical challenges. Mr. Speaker, we want to reassure residents that we have a plan in place to optimize our vaccine supply over the coming weeks. We have received our third shipment of 4,700 vaccines and we are waiting for an update about the fourth shipment of vaccine. With that information in hand, we will announce any changes to our plan going forward. I remain committed to keeping the public informed through scheduled media briefings as well as communications channels online, on the radio, and through on-the-ground staff in person. It is important to remember that the public health measures and surveillance system that have protected NWT residents from COVID-19 so far are all still in place and working extremely well. We will continue to use every possible tool to protect our territory from COVID-19, including: public health orders, effective wastewater testing, point of care testing, self-isolation and vaccine delivery. Together we can keep COVID 19 from jeopardizing our well-being and move toward loosening restrictions when conditions are right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Simpson: Indigenous Languages Month 2021,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, the Northwest Territories is home to a diverse group of people who live in a vibrant landscape shaped by rich culture and heritage. Our nine official Indigenous languages and our cultures bear sacred values and traditional knowledge that have been passed on through generations, shaping our identity and defining what makes the North truly unique. As leaders and residents of the Northwest Territories, we share the responsibility of revitalizing our Indigenous languages through celebration and practice to preserve our traditional ways of life. As Minister of Education, Culture and Employment, I would like to wish all Members of this Legislative Assembly, and the residents of the Northwest Territories, a happy Indigenous Languages Month. This month is an opportunity for residents to honour the rich culture and heritage embodied by the Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Territories and our nine official Indigenous languages. The theme for Indigenous Languages Month 2021 is Cook With Me, which supports the mandate of this government to increase food security and is inspired by the United Nations’ International Year of Fruits and Vegetables in 2021. This unique theme was cooked up in partnership with the NWT Literacy Council and embodies messages of warmth, home, family, and cooperation. Food and cooking are at the heart of our traditions, memories, identities, and togetherness. Food brings people from different cultures together, allowing us to learn about one another’s backgrounds. We share our cultural heritage when we share food with others. Saying cook with me to our families and friends is an invitation to strengthen our togetherness, traditions, and customs. Mr. Speaker, throughout February we encourage Northwest Territories residents to engage in the exciting activities and resources that have been organized for Indigenous Languages Month. In partnership with the NWT Literacy Council, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment has prepared a number of initiatives. You will see a social media campaign featured on the NWT Indigenous Language and Education Facebook page that will support the theme Cook With Me. In addition, a Regional Recipe Book featuring recipes from individuals and families across all the regions of the Northwest Territories has been translated into all official Indigenous languages and will be made available over the course of the month on the ECE website and social media. This week you can view recipes in Tłı̨chǫ and North Slavey on our Facebook page. Lastly, digital Indigenous language Valentine’s Day cards will be available for sharing with friends and loved ones. This month, we are also offering regional Indigenous governments celebratory grants to produce videos and other creative projects that promote, celebrate and engage in Indigenous Languages Month. We have also engaged with schools across the territory to encourage them to celebrate by creating food-themed lesson plans that are linked to the Our Languages curriculum by using Indigenized approaches to culinary arts classes, and by organizing celebrations of traditional foods in schools. Promoting food preparation-themed language education supports the Our Languages curriculum and provides the opportunity to learn Indigenous languages and culture, while also promoting food security for our youth. Mr. Speaker, it fills me with pride to live in and represent our territory which has an abundant living history full of vibrant culture. Mahsi cho to the Elders, community leaders, language advocates and teachers who continue to promote Indigenous language revitalization efforts across the Northwest Territories. I encourage all Northerners to advocate for Indigenous languages and join me in celebrating Indigenous Languages Month. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

246,2021-02-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-homeownership-program-changes,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Homeownership Program Changes,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, in my time as the Minister Responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation I have made it a priority to travel to communities to listen to what our residents are telling us about housing and then seeking solutions to the barriers that are identified. Homeownership is a goal for many of us, but it can be a challenge. The costs of owning and maintaining a home can be expensive, and out of reach for many of us, especially those in rural and remote communities. The Housing Corporation was tasked to look at their housing programs to identify ways to address these barriers and where necessary, come up with new options to help encourage, increase and sustain homeownership.  The Housing Corporation is working towards eliminating barriers and has now eliminated the requirement for land tenure and home insurance when accessing emergency and major repair programs in rural and remote communities.  Mr. Speaker, as much as we always want our homeowners to have tenure and insurance so that they have a level of protection for their home, it is not always available or affordable. For our smaller rural and remote communities, these are two major challenges faced by homeowners in accessing funding for much needed major repairs.  Supplies and services are often limited to Local Housing Organizations, or LHOs, and public housing is typically the only source of housing. Homeownership can be challenging to achieve without government support. We have a lot of skilled homeowners with the know-how and the desire to do their own repairs. However, many communities lack a readily available source for materials and items needed for those repairs.  The Housing Corporation will provide access to LHOs’ materials and services in communities where they do not exist.  Mr. Speaker, helping our residents get into homeownership offers considerable benefits. 	To achieve this, the Housing Corporation will increase their focus on the sale of detached public housing inventory to expand homeownership to those who have lived in these homes long term. The program will be available to all families that are residing in a detached public housing unit and can afford the cost of operating and maintaining their own home. In doing so, we will also build replacement public housing that not only reduces waiting lists, but also creates opportunities to address critical areas such as affordable housing for single and two person households. While this is a great step forward, these actions would not be complete if we did not also support these households in their transition. Moving from renter to homeowner brings on more responsibilities, and people need to be prepared for that. To ensure this, tenants will be provided with the tools to become successful homeowners such as additional counselling, as well as maintenance and repair courses, and courses on developing financial skills. Mr. Speaker, beginning in 2020, the Housing Corporation is planning to build at least three new homes and implement a new pilot program targeted to income-earning families to transition to homeownership from public housing.  The Housing Corporation will also begin the Lease-to-Own Program beginning in early 2021. Mr. Speaker, supporting homeownership is essential for addressing housing needs in the NWT. Homeownership obviously not for everyone, but if we can do this in a way that supports the needs our people, the benefits will be meaningful. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
247,2021-02-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-public-land-act-public-engagement,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Public Land Act - Public Engagement,"Check against delivery  Mr. Speaker, the Public Land Act  received assent on August 21, 2019, at the end of the 18th Legislative Assembly. The new Public Land Act consolidates the existing Northwest Territories Lands Act and the Commissioner’s Land Act into one cohesive land management regime. To bring the Act into force, new regulations must be developed.   The Department of Lands is taking a phased approach to regulation development.  Phase one is focused on the essential regulations necessary to bring the Public Land Act into force in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022-2023. These regulations will address public land grants and dispositions such as leases and licences of occupation, quarry administration, security requirements and restoration, and general rights to use public land. With the Public Land Act in force, phase two will then commence and focus on evolving the regulatory model to address policy approaches and needs. As the Minister responsible, I am committed to having these regulations in place as soon as possible. With that said, the process and timelines must allow for meaningful involvement of Members of this Legislative Assembly, Indigenous and community governments, leaseholders, stakeholders, and the public. Mr. Speaker, the first round of engagement, which began on December 10, 2020, introduces the project, and invites comments and ideas for developing the regulations.     As of January 22nd, the online engagement platform has seen over 1200 visits and over 105 people engaging with the content.  Lease fees are a key topic of discussion on the engagement platform.  Lease fees are calculated differently under the two existing acts. The new regulations will create consistency around public land valuation and pricing which is a key objective of the new regulations. The Department of Lands will also be reviewing the types of leases that can be issued with the objective of providing greater clarity for residential and commercial land users, including those in the agricultural sector.   Mr. Speaker, Northwest Territories residents have the opportunity to shape legislation that supports our decisions on how land and resources in the Northwest Territories are administered and used, both for current residents and our future generations. I encourage all residents to visit the Department of Lands website and click on the Have Your Say section, to provide input on how the Government of the Northwest Territories regulates public land. This first phase of engagement will be open until February 12th.  As you know, the Government of the Northwest Territories is looking at a proposed approach for how Standing Committees could be more involved in the development of regulations. The Department of Lands will follow the process and plan once it is developed. In the interim, I would invite Committee Members to engage in this work over the coming months. A second round of public engagement is targeted for the Fall of 2021 and will provide an opportunity for public comment on the proposed regulations.  It is important to emphasize that we are all users of public land. Developing new tools for managing land and natural resources is an ongoing commitment since devolution. These regulations are part of that ongoing work. This engagement is an opportunity for Northwest Territories  residents to contribute to decisions about Northwest Territories land and resources according to their own priorities. Mr. Speaker, this is an important milestone for the Department of Lands  and the Government of the Northwest Territories. Residents can be part of the history of land management in the Northwest Territories  by participating in the public engagement to develop the Public Land Act regulations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
248,2021-02-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-archie-update-2030-energy-strategy-0,Government Website,Diane Archie: Update on the 2030 Energy Strategy,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to strengthening our leadership and authority on climate change as well as enhancing efforts to stabilize the cost of power and increase the use of alternative and renewable energy. As part of these commitments, our government has made almost $26 million in energy-related investments this past year, which are highlighted in the 2019-20 Energy Initiatives Report, which was released in January. Designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, provide reliable energy to our communities and stabilize energy costs for residents, the projects highlighted in the initiatives report support the goals set in the Northwest Territories’ 2030 Energy Strategy. Some of these projects include the ongoing work being done by our partner, the Arctic Energy Alliance, or AEA. With federal funding from the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund, the AEA launched a series of new and enhanced programs. Some of these help lower-income homeowners winterize their homes, and others provide rebates on new electric vehicles and energy efficient products. In fact, this past year, AEA doubled the amount of rebates provided to households. Mr. Speaker, the GNWT also continues to roll out the Greenhouse Gas Grant Program. This year, $274 thousand was awarded to a northern-owned plumbing and heating company in Yellowknife. The company will install a wood pellet boiler district heating system that will supply heat to its headquarters and the GNWT central warehouse. This system also has the potential to connect to other private commercial buildings in the area. Once complete, this project is expected to displace over 190 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions and save 60 thousand litres of oil annually. Mr. Speaker, progress was also made this year with the proposed Taltson Hydro Expansion project. This project has the potential to displace greenhouse gas emissions, while supporting efforts to stabilize the cost of energy, and create significant opportunities for Indigenous participation and benefits and employment opportunities for all Northerners. As part of the GNWT’s assessment for the Taltson expansion, the GNWT has signed an agreement with the Arctic Research Foundation to map two potential submarine transmission line routes on the lakebed of Great Slave Lake. As identified in the Energy Initiatives Report, the expedition included the participation of students from Łutselk’e and the Yellowknife area, who received hands-on training from scientists and local crew in advanced mapping technology and marine vessel operation. Hopefully, these students will use this experience to inspire new and creative solutions for our future. Mr. Speaker, the GNWT is setting the stage for other ambitious energy projects. One example is the Inuvik Wind Project, another key initiative under the 2030 Energy Strategy. The project will see a 3.5-megawatt wind turbine installed, reducing diesel consumption in our largest off-grid community by up to 30%. Late last year we secured a land use permit and water license from the Gwich’in Land and Water Board. The GNWT looks forward to advancing this project to the construction phase, realizing its environmental, economic and regional benefits. Mr. Speaker, these are just some examples of the exciting energy projects happening across the territory today.  The GNWT will continue to engage directly with communities and Indigenous governments and organizations to ensure their participation, partnership, and empowerment when proposing and implementing energy solutions. We all have a role to play in making sure that the NWT meets its climate change objectives. Through government support and individual action, we can make it happen. Quana, Mr. Speaker"
249,2021-02-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-corrections-service-moves-forward-workplace-improvement,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Corrections Service Moves Forward on Workplace Improvement ,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, corrections can be a difficult and challenging field. In addition to the demanding environment and 24/7 operations, the Corrections Service must always adapt to the ever evolving best practices. Five years ago, the Auditor General gave us a path forward to address conditions that focused on our case management and programs for offenders and as a result, significant changes have been made. This summer, a new Corrections Act will come into force signaling a shift towards a greater focus on rehabilitation and reintegration, and enhancing transparency and accountability of corrections services. We are moving in the right direction, and have made progress but clearly, more work needs to be done. Over the last number of years, the Department of Justice has heard various concerns raised by Corrections Service staff regarding their workplaces. To fully understand and address these concerns, the Deputy Minister of the Department of Justice initiated a workplace assessment to hear directly from staff across various levels and locations of the Corrections Services. This work was conducted by an independent contractor to encourage honest, confidential discussions. The goal was to hear from as many employees as possible. I want to thank and commend the staff who took the time to share their workplace experiences, both good and bad, with the consultants.  It shows they care, are passionate, and want to be involved in making improvements and constructive change. The final assessment report identified specific areas where we are doing well, and areas where we need to do better, including staffing; policies and directives; safety, leadership and support; and communication. The report also highlighted the need for management to do a better job engaging with staff prior to implementing changes. The Department of Justice provided the report to staff to allow them time to consider solutions for moving forward. Senior leadership held numerous meetings with staff in December to discuss initiatives currently underway that will help address some of the concerns, and to open the lines of communication and listen to additional solutions to address the areas where improvement is needed. Mr. Speaker, some of the actions we are currently undertaking include; revising and updating the Corrections Northern Recruitment Training Program; implementing new processes to ensure staff receive re-certification training in a timely manner; a full replacement of uniforms to ensure they are complete and fit appropriately; and continued participation in appropriate Leadership Training for supervisors and managers within the Corrections Service so they are better equipped to support and lead their staff. Meetings between management and staff will continue so that site specific operational challenges and issues can be addressed collaboratively. I want to assure Members that the workplace assessment report will not be shelved and forgotten about. The report laid bare issues across the Corrections Service, and we must confront those issues head-on. The Department of Justice will be held accountable for the response to the concerns raised by staff and, Mr. Speaker, they want to be held accountable to ensure that these issues are addressed to the best of their abilities. However, there is recognition that the Department of Justice cannot make all the necessary improvements on its own. There is a need for a more collaborative working relationship between the Department of Justice and the Department of Finance, in their role as Human Resources, as well as with the Union of Northern Workers, or UNW. Acknowledging this, a working group has been established, chaired by the Assistant Deputy Minister, Solicitor General and will include senior officials from both departments, as well as the UNW. The working group will report progress to the Deputy Minister of Finance, the Deputy Minister of Justice and the President of the UNW. This group will listen to, and learn from, our dedicated Corrections professionals, as the team works collectively to improve Corrections Services workplaces.  This working group will oversee the development and implementation of a Corrections Service Workplace Assessment Accountability Framework, a monitoring and evaluation process and a staff communication plan. As outlined in the Department of Justice’s 2020-2023 Business Plan, the Accountability Framework for Corrections, previously called the Human Resources Plan, will be established before the end of this sitting and all of the initiatives in the plan will be implemented by 2024.    I commit to providing updates on the progress the Department of Justice is making toward improving Corrections Services.  We must remember, our goal is always to ensure the safety of corrections staff and individuals within the corrections system. To feel safe, our staff must feel supported in their daily work so they, in turn, can successfully support probation clients and inmates as they work to make the necessary changes to reintegrate back into our communities. Our employees are hard-working, professional and dedicated, and with their help, and the help of the working group, we will make positive changes to the corrections work environment and, as a result, to the safety of the people in our care.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
250,2021-02-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/government-northwest-territories-releases-2021-22-budget,Government Website,Government of the Northwest Territories Releases 2021-22 Budget ,"Finance Minister Caroline Wawzonek released the 2021-22 Budget, the second budget of the 19th Legislative Assembly. Total revenues of $2.192 billion are expected in 2021‑22 and total expenditures of $2.124 billion, which include spending for programs and services and infrastructure contributions. The 2021‑22 surplus is forecasted to be $69 million. Revised estimates project a third consecutive operating deficit in 2020‑21 of $31 million. Although revenues are projected to be higher than operating spending over the next few years, the operating surpluses are expected to shrink and return to deficits by 2025‑26. Budget 2021 includes $117 million in increased spending compared to Budget 2020. This includes $90 million for program enhancements and proposals for $26 million in spending for initiatives to further advance the priorities of the 19th Assembly. The Budget also contains $41 million in spending in 2021-22 only to continue supports to meet the challenges of the pandemic. There was $15 million in savings identified to help offset the spending increases. There are no new taxes announced in Budget 2021. As previously announced, the carbon tax will increase to $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions on July 1, 2021, equivalent to 2.4 cents per litre of gasoline. Increased revenue from carbon pricing will be recycled to NWT residents and businesses including an increase to the Cost of Living Offset to $208 per adult and $240 per child. Quote: “We are putting forth a budget that continues to build on the foundation laid at the beginning of the 19th Legislative Assembly. I am optimistic that Budget 2021 will keep moving us forward on our priorities as we begin the work to re-build our economy and start the social recovery. Budget 2021 reflects what we heard in the Budget Dialogues, where participants asked us to strive for efficiency, get clearer value for our money and do so without introducing any new taxes or impacting programs and services. Budget 2021 is part of even bigger conversations moving towards stronger fiscal sustainability.” - Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance Quick Facts: Budget 2021 forecasts an operating surplus of $69 million in 2021‑22 after a projected $31 million deficit in 2020‑21. Budget 2021 proposes $117 million, or 6.2 per cent, in increased spending compared to Budget 2020: $104 million to enhance existing programs, $26 million in initiatives, and $2 million in amortization and $15 million in savings. Borrowing is projected to increase $254 million, to $1.585 billion in total debt at the end of 2021-22. Capital investment is partially funded from the cash generated from an operating surplus and the past three years of operating deficits have increased borrowing. However, the GNWT’s debt level remains affordable and interest rates remain low.

251,2021-02-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-budget-address-2021-2022,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Budget Address 2021-2022,"Check Against Delivery   Mr. Speaker, approximately one year ago, I stood in this Assembly and introduced Budget 2020 as part of a journey. I described it as a foundation from which we could build a positive fiscal path towards long term economic growth and stability. There were already negative economic indicators but I said that we should not describe our circumstances as a crisis. I said that I was cautiously optimistic that achieving our priorities and building from a solid foundation was possible with discipline and planning. At the time of tabling Budget 2020, I did not predict that last year’s budget session would end abruptly to focus government efforts on a pandemic that was creating a public health crisis, not only in the Northwest Territories, but across Canada and around the world. The need to shut down to contain the virus resulted in an economic crisis for the Northwest Territories; a crisis that has impacted people in different ways, as many have lost their livelihoods or face precarious financial futures. Mr. Speaker, the world has and still is experiencing a crisis. While all levels of government moved with speed and collaboration to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are still experiencing how quickly things change. In tackling the pre-existing challenges of our undiversified economy, made only more immediate by the impacts of the pandemic, we should remember that the economy is not a ‘thing.’ An economy is the way that we as a society choose to allocate our resources to serve our families, our communities and our society’s needs and wants: education and opportunities for our children and grandchildren, appropriate health care, housing, and food. Challenges and crisis provide opportunity and motivation for needed change and for unified effort towards common goals. Knowing all this, I remain cautiously optimistic about our future. I do not arrive at this optimism lightly. I will share three reasons with you. First, the people of the Northwest Territories have confirmed that our brand of Northern spirit, resilience, and community is stronger than ever. We all saw the power of coming together to follow health protocols, supporting our local economy, taking staycations and finding creative ways to continue to deliver goods and services. Second, our fiscal structure has insulated us from even greater economic shocks and allows us an opportunity to preserve stability as we look towards recovery. While in other times many, including me, have expressed concern over the challenge of an undiversified economy, in the present economic climate having a large public sector has helped support continued levels of employment and disposable income. Territorial Formula Financing, among other federal supports, has kept our revenues comparatively stable. Last, and where I will spend the majority of this Budget Address, is on the foundations we have started to build for a healthy, resilient and more diverse economic future for the Northwest Territories. With the anxieties of the pandemic ever present, I did not realize just how far we have actually come in the journey I spoke about one year ago until I began to prepare for this Budget Address. As I will soon describe, we are building foundations for a well-educated population, healthy and safe families and communities, and economic opportunities both territory-building in scale and at community levels and we are changing the way we do business to get better value for the people of the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, while delivering the Budget this year, it is important to directly acknowledge the need for economic recovery. That fact does not diminish the reasons for optimism I shared earlier. Just in time to be reflected in Budget 2021, we have the benefit of the Business Advisory Council’s report speaking to both relief and recovery from COVID-19. The report highlights the need to focus on education, green technology and our opportunity to not only move towards greener energy solutions but to be part of a critical mineral value chain that will supply the world with the technological requirements for greener energy, as well as business support through government procurement, catching up our infrastructure across sectors, and more and better opportunities for equity participation by Indigenous governments. I feel optimistic knowing that we all share similar goals and, again, the foundation to achieve those important asks are reflected throughout this Budget. The strength, resiliency and creativity of the Northwest Territories population cannot be overstated as an economic benefit. I heard directly from many residents and organizations during Budget Dialogues last summer that although there is anxiety and worry, people continue to believe we can achieve stability and growth. There was a desire for fiscal stability, which this Budget provides by avoiding cuts or new taxes. There was also a strong connection drawn between long-term investments in people, including education and health, and future financial wellbeing, which is also reflected in this Budget. Another strong theme was the need to know that the government will be efficient and fiscally responsible with an eye on the future. This last ask is the goal of the Government Renewal initiative that I announced in October and which is now underway. This does not require new funding from this Budget but it will be a significant government-wide effort to ensure our fiscal house is in good order. Mr. Speaker, I present Budget 2021 as a stability budget that builds on the foundations we have set over the past year and allows further opportunity to advance many important projects. In this time of uncertainty we propose to carry on with $2 billion in expenditures and no spending reductions. Over the next few minutes I will share details of the work happening across departments that will support our economic future; describe ongoing investments in our people, our anchor industries and our communities, and what is being done to ensure government efficiency so that I can continue to stand in the Assembly and say that we should look with optimism towards our future. Economic Outlook Mr. Speaker, we estimate that the Northwest Territories economy shrank almost 7 per cent in 2020 because of the immediate and severe economic disruption caused by the global coronavirus pandemic at the beginning of the year. By the end of 2020 we saw the predicted economic rebound begin and we expect economic activity this year to continue to recover from the 2020 low. The Northwest Territories economy in 2021 will likely remain smaller than it was in 2019 and the risks and challenges remain the same as before the pandemic’s economic shock. Until the global health crisis is under control, a full recovery of the territorial economy will be slow and uneven. Industries such as local retail, construction, and public administration have seen faster returns towards pre-pandemic strength, while hard hit sectors such as tourism, hospitality, airlines, mining, and wholesale trade continue to struggle. Global lockdowns and border closures, reluctance or lack of opportunity to travel by air, and reduced international demand for diamonds, fur and aurora tours, mean our hardest hit sectors will take more time to show signs of recovery. Long-term challenges such as maturing diamond mines, an aging population, and a lack of economic diversification or private-sector activity will depress future growth unless there are substantial structural changes. Long-term structural challenges must not be underestimated. Meanwhile, we must remain vigilant about public health orders because more coronavirus cases in the territory could dampen economic recovery. Putting forward a recovery plan while still in the midst of an evolving crisis is challenging. We need to invest when the moment is right to catch the wave of recovery while not underestimating the full extent of the pandemic and invest too soon. With a spirit of knowing what we can accomplish together, especially when collectively motivated, we are working to develop our recovery roadmap. It will evolve as the distribution of the vaccines changes the way we respond to the pandemic. We should all feel encouraged that with the vaccine, the “can do” attitude shown by the public service from the earliest days of the pandemic through to the vaccine roll out, the creativity and patience of the business community, and the investments proposed in Budget 2021, we can move quickly with a flexible and responsive recovery. Budget Highlights The GNWT is a large player in the territory’s economy. Budget 2021 has no reductions because right now the economy needs support. Despite welcomed additional federal transfers since last March to help us keep our residents safe and our economy working, we expect to spend more on programs and services in 2020-21 than we will bring in as revenues. For the third year in a row we anticipate that we will have an operating deficit. This means that we needed to borrow more than expected for the capital budget and debt is projected to increase to $1.33 billion by March 31, 2021. In Budget 2021, thanks again to increased federal support, we are projecting revenues to be higher than operating expenditures, which will produce a $69 million operating surplus. However, we need more than this operating surplus to pay for the $441 million capital plan approved last October and to start reducing the debt that we have already accumulated. Revenues Revenues are projected to be $2.2 billion in 2021-22. We are expecting lower amounts of our own revenues, especially corporate income tax, resource royalties and revenues from the Yellowknife Airport and Marine Transportation System revolving funds. The federal government is providing additional funds above the typical annual transfers and our fiscal independence has weakened as a result. The combination of increased transfers and lower own source revenues has increased the federal contribution to our total revenues from an average 81 per cent to over 85 per cent. While Territorial Formula Financing arrangements provide a stable and predictable revenue base, we are facing serious risks to our own source revenues. A slowing economy will likely mean several years of declining tax revenue, especially corporate and personal income taxes, and potentially little resource revenues. Furthermore, we face significant risks to both our own revenue base and federal transfers if our population starts to decline. Mr. Speaker, we have chosen to balance our need for revenue by supporting a competitive tax regime for small business, reducing the small business tax rate from 4 per cent to 2 per cent effective January 1, 2021. In an average year, this will result in foregone revenues of about $1.7 million annually but provides greater value by leaving small business with more resources to grow the economy. Continuing our usual practice, we will increase property tax rates and some fees to match inflation. As we agreed by signing the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, our carbon tax rates will increase to $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions on July 1, 2021. Although this will add 2.4 cents in additional tax to a litre of gasoline and corresponding increases to other carbon-based fuels, our suite of carbon tax rebates will continue and the Cost of Living Offset will increase on July 1 to $208 per adult and $240 per child to help residents adjust to the higher carbon price. Expenditures Mr. Speaker, we are proposing to spend $2 billion on programs and services in 2021-22, an increase of $117 million from last year’s budget, a result of $132 million in new spending that is partially offset by $15 million in savings. Not all of this funding will be rolled into the operating budget expenditure base for future years, such as the $41 million for various COVID-19 supports included in the Budget to continue to keep our communities and residents safe. We are hopeful that our evolving response to the public health risks will make a portion of the $35 million for the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat included in this Budget unnecessary with the need for the Secretariat phased out over the 2021-22 fiscal year. The Budget includes $4.3 million for contributions to our schools to ensure that learning continues while we keep our children safe and an additional $1.1 million to Student Financial Assistance for extra support to post-secondary students for their increased education costs because of the pandemic. Excluding the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat and other COVID-related supports, Budget 2021 includes $2.3 million more for new asset amortization costs and $90 million in new spending. This new spending includes $23 million to maintain existing service levels in some programs, $40 million to enhance programs and services already offered and $26 million to further our priorities. Social Programs and Community Wellness Over 60 per cent of our spending on programs and services goes to investments in our people and to keep our communities healthy and safe. Spending on social programs and communities underpins a healthy economy. We propose in this Budget to increase spending on these vital programs by $64 million, including $20 million for initiatives that directly address priorities of this Assembly; $28 million to continue or enhance work already underway; and $16 million to address funding pressures such as in income assistance, medical travel expenses and shelter funding. Budget 2021 includes $4.5 million to complete the phased approach to bring child and youth care counsellors to all regions of the territory to support young people facing a range of personal or social issues. This program will provide year-round support and ensure that help is available after-hours. We need to better protect vulnerable children and we are proposing to add $7 million to the Child and Family Services budget for this purpose. These new resources will expand the ability of Child and Family Services to address gaps in the system and to accelerate implementation of its Quality Improvement Plan. The additional resources will compress what was a five-year plan into three years with the second phase expected to be completed shortly and the third phase in 2021-22. The funding will increase the number of Community Social Services Workers, family preservation workers, child and youth placement coordinators, foster care and adoption workers, and case aid workers to help vulnerable children and their families. The Office of the Children’s Lawyer is experiencing an increased number of clients and we have included an additional $99,000 in funding to support service availability. Mr. Speaker, we want our families to be healthy. We propose to renew and improve the Healthy Family program with $1.1 million to help parents ensure their children get a good start in life. The Healthy Family program was re-designed with support from families, communities and other partners to better reflect early childhood development and culturally-based prevention priorities. A good start in life needs to include opportunities for early learning and quality child care. One significant reason for the lack of licensed child care spaces is the high costs of infrastructure to start up or expand operations. By providing ongoing funding of $500,000 in this Budget to subsidise facility repairs and renovations, we will help increase the number of daycare spaces and improve child care availability and affordability. Before remote learning became a common concept across Canada last March, the GNWT had already introduced the Northern Distance Learning program so that youth in remote communities could remain with their families and still have access to educational opportunities available in larger centres. We are including an additional $1.2 million for the Northern Distance Learning program in this Budget to fulfil the next step in the multi-year plan to improve and enhance services and make the program available to more students. If we want better education outcomes for our children, we need to ensure that our schools use the best practices and that these practices have the support of parents and students, education staff and Indigenous governments. This Budget includes $306,000 for the first year of a three-year plan to modernize and renew the Education Act to support an education system that will set our students up for success. We are also proposing to include $265,000 in this Budget to advance the development and implementation of competency-based professional standards for Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 educators. Connecting students to jobs is good for the student, good for business, and good for the economy. With an additional $508,000, we propose to hire Career and Education Advisors in the Dehcho, Sahtu, and South Slave regions, similar to the advisors already in the North Slave region. These advisors will work with students and their parents and guardians to provide information for the transition to post-secondary schooling, provide advice to Aurora College students on Northern job opportunities, promote the Schools North Apprenticeship Program for skilled trades and certifications, and help post-secondary territorial students connect with employers. As the territory’s population ages, the GNWT plans to significantly increase long-term care spaces where they are needed most. We have added $406,000 in this Budget to address increased costs for long-term care services currently provided by Avens. Budget 2021 includes $1.1 million to train more personal support workers and licensed practical nurses through Aurora College to care for long-term care residents with graduates who have gained their skills within our Territorial community. Community governments deliver services that are vital for the survival of our communities and our economy. To help reduce the gap between the cost of providing municipal services and the revenues that communities can raise themselves, we propose to increase annual community government funding by $3.3 million. Communities can count on their share of this revenue to continue year-over-year to more adequately fund their operations and water and sewer services; however, we estimate that there is still a $16.4 million funding gap for these community budgets and we will continue to work with our community government partners to address this gap. We are exploring better ways to keep our communities safe. This Budget includes a $303,000 proposal for a pilot Community Safety Officer Program that will be community-led and developed using best practices from other jurisdictions to guide implementation. Administered by a community government, Community Safety officers will be a visible presence in the community to deter crime and will develop close working relationships with the RCMP, municipal and territorial enforcement agencies. These officers will not carry weapons and will actively work with citizens in a culturally appropriate way to promote community wellbeing. Budget 2021 includes a number of other investments in justice programs. We are proposing to continue work already started with the Government of Canada with an additional $158,000 in 2021-22 for finalizing and implementing the Gun and Gang Strategy. This work supports community-level prevention and enforcement efforts to address criminal activity arising from organized crime and to appropriately design a response to the violence, fear, and harm created by gangs. In response to increased demand for court sittings we propose to include $233,000 to create two new sheriff positions in Yellowknife. We have also included $123,000 in this Budget to address rising costs for providing services to inmates at the North Slave Correctional Complex. The demands of round-the-clock law enforcement in our largest city, combined with new training requirements, means it is necessary to include $422,000 in this Budget for three more RCMP constables in Yellowknife. Finally, we accept the recommendations in the 2020 Judicial Remuneration Commission Report by including $257,000 in this Budget for additional compensation and training opportunities for Territorial Court judges. The 19th Legislative Assembly has a clear priority to increase the number of affordable homes and reduce core housing need. The 2021-22 Budget proposes to provide the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation with the first $5 million, out of a total of $15 million over three years, so that it can participate in the National Housing Co-Investment Fund and expand the number of housing projects it can undertake. We also propose to provide the Corporation with $300,000 to help low-income homeowners replace ageing fuel tanks and an additional $109,000 to assist emergency shelters facing increased costs due to inflation. We are proposing to add $4 million to the Income Assistance program to address both an increase in clients and changes in allowances. Escalating drug and non-discretionary supply costs, as well as more patients requiring out-of-territory care, have put huge expenditure pressures on our health system and we are addressing these pressures with a further $30 million for increased health care expenditures in this Budget, including $8.4 million in federal funding to improve services under the First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care Agreement. This additional funding addresses some of the annual overage in the Department of Health and Social Services budget such as $7.5 million to reflect the 24 hours, seven days a week nature of operations, $3.4 million for medical travel, $1.8 million for supplementary health benefits and $4.2 million for out-of-territory hospital and physician services for residents. We recognize that the need for $30 million in one year to address the fiscal challenges in our health care system is significant. The Department of Health and Social Services has developed a Sustainability Plan to ensure the long-term fiscal viability of our health services in the face of mounting costs so that residents continue to receive the best possible physical and mental health care. We are proposing $280,000 in this Budget to extend the community-based peer support program started this year for people with mental health and addiction issues. Increasing evidence is showing that supportive relationships between people with common experiences help reduce hospitalization and distress and improve the quality of life of participants. As part of our ongoing partnership with Canada on home and community care, we are proposing a $290,000 increase in the Budget to further support the Paid Family Caregiver Project and fund project software to improve service delivery. We are looking in this Budget to maintain the momentum to preserve, revitalize and strengthen Indigenous languages with $600,000 in continued spending to develop an Indigenous Languages Adult Immersion Diploma in partnership with Aurora College, the University of Victoria and Indigenous governments. This post-secondary programming will be used to help develop a new generation of proficient Indigenous Language speakers and a work force that can fill occupations requiring the ability to speak Indigenous languages. We have also partnered with Canada on minority language development and propose to include $711,000 as a continuation of the Canada-Northwest Territories Agreement on Minority Language Education and Second Official Language Instruction. This funding will provide for French language education in schools and the Collège nordique francophone. Job Growth and Economic Development Mr. Speaker, the coronavirus pandemic has hurt some businesses more than others. Many businesses will take time to recover and others may close permanently. The pandemic was yet another reminder that the dependence on government and the resource industry makes the territorial economy extremely vulnerable and our past approach to implementing economic strategies has not done enough to provide economic diversity, stability and strength. A successful future economy needs investments in lifelong education. That is one of the main reasons why we have done the legislative groundwork to transform Aurora College into a polytechnic university. We also need to ensure that we have processes in place to monitor and evaluate our post-secondary programs so that students can be assured that our educational programs meet the required standards and quality found at other Canadian universities. To achieve this, we are proposing to add $177,000 for a Quality Assurance Coordinator to maintain quality instruction at the post-secondary level. Over the past year the tourism sector, and many of the hospitality and accommodation businesses associated with it, have been especially hard hit by the impacts of a pandemic that crippled travel and tourism world-wide. The Northwest Territories remains a spectacular destination for Canadians and international travellers alike and we want to remind the world of all that we offer as a destination. The proposed $936,000 in this Budget for a renewed Tourism 2025 investment strategy is intended to help our tourism sector to return to 2018-19 levels of visitors and spending by 2024-25 by preserving funding of existing programs, and introducing new services and activities, providing training for operators and tourism staff and gathering data to better guide and evaluate investments. The challenges in our resource sector are rooted in the global market but we can still find effective ways to support this vital part of our economy. We need to provide clarity, certainty and an inclusive approach to balancing priorities of exploration, development, community involvement and environmental stewardship. We have the opportunity to position the Northwest Territories as a leader in responsible resource exploration and development by drafting sensible regulations that do not discourage resource development while still providing the environmental protection that Northwest Territories residents expect. This Budget includes an additional $360,000 in 2021-22 only to develop the regulations for the Mineral Resources Act that came into effect near the end of the 18th Legislative Assembly. We also propose to maintain the Mineral Incentive Program by re-instating $400,000 for 2021-22 and propose $225,000 for the continued implementation of the Petroleum Resources Strategy. We are continuing to implement our commercial fisheries revitalization strategy for a viable Great Slave Lake commercial fishery. To support commercial fishers on Great Slave Lake we propose to include $150,000 to expand the role of the fish officer position while the fish processing facility is being built in Hay River. We also propose a $100,000 contribution to assist the Tu Cho Fishers Cooperative to complete the work necessary to put the plant into operation. On the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Accountability and Oversight, the Budget includes $510,000 to further address the mandate priority to increase the amount of food produced locally. We propose to direct $110,000 of this funding to the Sustainable Livelihoods Program to work with partners to develop and deliver harvesting training courses, including safety and navigation, harvesting and processing skills and food preparation. We also propose to allocate $400,000 of this funding to implement a food safety framework and develop appropriate food safety regulations that will help remove obstacles that prevent residents producing their own food and distributing to others. We intend to sharpen the focus on our efforts to address unauthorized land occupancy by proposing $309,000 to address untenured and unauthorized occupancy on public lands. We will use these funds, along with participation from Indigenous groups and Northwest Territories residents, to identify ownership, determine if occupancy is based on traditional rights, offer tenure to land if appropriate or move ahead to remove unauthorized occupants. We also intend to support better land use planning with $253,000 to staff the Wek’èezhìi land use planning office. We aim to link our support for regional economic development with opportunities in the knowledge economy by proposing to include $350,000 to capitalize on our knowledge economy strengths and establish regional economic development plans with our partners. Climate Change and Environment The Northwest Territories is at the forefront of the effects of climate change and sees its impact on our environment, wildlife, and people. In October 2020, the GNWT allocated $2.6 million to support five departments in staffing 14 new full-time and 2 new seasonal climate change-related positions located in Yellowknife, Hay River, Fort Smith and Inuvik for implementation of the 2030 NWT Climate Change Strategic Framework action plan. Budget 2021 plans to continue this work with an additional $2.6 million. This funding will be used to help the Northwest Territories transition to an economy that uses fossil fuels less intensively and is better able to adapt to the effects of climate change on the natural environment, human health and wellbeing, culture and heritage, infrastructure, and the economy. The GNWT is also establishing a Northwest Territories Climate Change Council to include Indigenous governments and organizations, community governments, and other external partners, including non-governmental organizations and industry representatives, in the implementation of our action plan. The Council will play a key role in strengthening the leadership and authority of the GNWT on climate change. Governance We are pleased to honour the new Délı̨ne Got’ı̨ne Government Financing Agreement with $199,000 for incremental grant funding, equivalent to funding received by other communities. As announced last July, we propose to invest $631,000 in this Budget to create a Gender Equity Unit to lead and coordinate all of the work being done to advance equality in the Northwest Territories. With these resources we want to better ensure that government decisions, including financial decisions, consider their sometimes unequal effect on people with different identity factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age or abilities. We want to support all departments and agencies to consider gender and identity factors so they can improve all services delivered and advance the goal of a more inclusive society. This work is just beginning for us but its purpose has been enshrined in Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and called for in the Calls to Justice of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. With an expanded unit, the GNWT can better serve the public by incorporating the perspectives of people from across the gender spectrum in its activities and assessing how diverse groups of Northwest Territories residents experience government policies. Government renewal  We have added new spending to this year’s operating and capital budgets without finding any savings or new revenues to pay for them in order to be a source of stability while we navigate globally uncertain times. As we advance in this Assembly, we will need to set ourselves on a better expenditure track if we want to be able to continue to make investments that will provide for a strengthened and diversified economy for the future. Mr. Speaker, not every initiative requires significant new funding. Some of the most important work we are doing towards improving our economic outlook and fiscal governance does not have its own budget line. For example, we have established a working group to find ways to reduce red tape for small business. The working group will look at regulations and processes used to enforce regulations that affect small business and will ask why we have certain regulations and assess the risk if the regulation is removed or the process is changed. We expect the working group to provide recommendations to improve regulations so they achieve their reason for existence with the least administrative burden possible. We have also recently announced the formal start of the procurement review. In addition, on October 30, 2020, I announced the next steps in the promise made in our first budget to use creativity and innovation to do better with the resources we have and move away from any pattern of spending that allows duplication. Starting immediately, the Department of Finance will be working with other departments to implement the government renewal initiative. Government renewal must take a comprehensive and whole-of-government review. The renewal starts with individual departments but will quickly extend to reviewing programs and outcomes that are shared across departments. We will be using program evaluation techniques, gathering objective evidence, and reporting on outcomes associated with the spending of public money to help inform financially responsible and sustainable policy decisions. The vision is to help departments build their budgets based on the value delivered in the service of public priorities rather than on incremental growth. This is a shift in the way we think about budgeting and the need for close coordination and clear communication between Government and the Members of the Legislative Assembly as the work progresses will be essential. We all have a role to play in ensuring that the GNWT is an effective and sustainable organization for the long term and that all of our decisions are driven by value and priorities that serve residents across the territory. Once a stronger culture of outcome evaluation and the processes of value-oriented budget are in place, the ongoing benefit for delivering on priorities will make the time and resources spent worthwhile. Conclusion – Looking Ahead Mr. Speaker, the health, social and economic crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has showed us the power of pulling together as a society and as a government in pursuit of a common goal; as we have done across the Northwest Territories in order to limit and contain the spread of COVID-19. We need to take advantage of this collective spirit to keep the momentum going towards the common goal of supporting the recovery and future economic growth. Budget 2021-22 is not itself a COVID-19 relief package. Our recovery cannot be a one-time event; it will need to reflect the changing landscape of this pandemic, including the vaccine roll out here and across Canada and the speed of the global economic recovery. Budget 2021 provides stability and builds on the foundations for economic growth that we already knew we needed last year. I remain cautiously optimistic about our economic and fiscal future; a future for all NWT residents. Through engagements with the business community, I know the frustrations and fears are very real but what they have said about our economy and ideas for change is not a surprise. That leaves me optimistic because I see the work we are doing to address those calls for change. Similarly, after conducting extensive Budget Dialogues last summer, we heard the calls from residents to ensure investments in people, to avoid government duplication, find internal efficiencies and ensure value for public dollars, this also gives me the confidence that our initiatives are on a good path. Budget 2021 continues to invest in health care, communities and community services, early childhood supports, education modernization including in distance education and progress on the Climate Action Plan. There are also investments towards a modern regulatory landscape for our mineral resource sector and public lands. Furthermore, we are advancing regional growth initiatives such as the Great Slave Lake fishery and exploring LNG feasibility. The three mandated infrastructure projects, the Mackenzie Valley Highway, Taltson hydro expansion and the Slave Geologic Corridor, continue to progress. In addition, there is an expansion of the Mackenzie Valley fibre optic line to Tuktoyaktuk and the GNWT is supporting the Tłı̨chǫ Government to run a fibre optic line to Whatí in conjunction with the final work on the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road. These projects, together with work announced by Northwestel last fall, means that all Northwest Territories communities will have access to high speed internet by 2023. Mr. Speaker, the pandemic is still with us just as much as the economic problems that pre-existed it. Our work to respond to all of these challenges is underway. Added to that is the resiliency of the people of the Northwest Territories. That resiliency is not new but it has been particularly strong and present through the pandemic; a resiliency that includes creativity, innovation and collaboration. With these foundations, we will build a healthier and more sustainable economic future for the Northwest Territories. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

253,2021-02-03,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/government-northwest-territories-successes-covid-19-vaccine-deliveries,Government Website,Government of the Northwest Territories Successes in COVID-19 Vaccine Deliveries,"Minister of Health and Social Services, Julie Green issued the following statement today: “Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) has been faced with finding unique ways to deal with the challenges presented to us. Most recently, our government has been tasked with finding creative ways to ensure the deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines are administered safely to Northwest Territories (NWT) residents in some of Canada’s most remote Northern communities. “I am proud to share that over 12 thousand doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been delivered to priority residents since rollout began on December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 vaccine has been successfully delivered to priority groups in all 33 NWT communities thanks to careful planning, logistical expertise, and support from local health care staff, vaccine teams, and communities alike. “This week, residents and staff in long term care facilities across the NWT started receiving second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and are developing full immunity against the disease. So far over 100 second doses of the vaccine have been given. “From the beginning, the GNWT has been committed to providing safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines to all eligible residents to reduce the impact of the virus in our territory. Staff at the Department of Health and Social Services (HSS) and Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority (NTHSSA) have led this ambitious vaccine campaign. “We are now facing challenges with the Moderna delivery but vaccine delivery in the NWT will continue. We knew that the allotment and delivery of doses were outside of our control, which is why our team built a flexible vaccine delivery schedule to account for shipment delays, weather, and other unforeseen challenges.  “It is important to remember that the public health measures and surveillance systems that have protected NWT residents from COVID-19 so far are all still in place and working extremely well. We will continue to use every possible tool to protect this territory from COVID-19, including public health orders, wastewater testing, point of care testing, and vaccine delivery. “I know many Northerners are eager to get the vaccine, and I want to reassure them that their turn will come. Remember, every dose given in the NWT boosts our territory’s defense against COVID-19 and benefits us all. “I want to express my gratitude to everyone involved in this work, particularly our frontline staff and the teams within the Department of HSS and NTHSSA.  The GNWT has had significant success with our vaccine delivery and those involved in this work should be proud of their efforts.  “For regular updates and the most up-to-date information, including vaccine schedule, visit www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19.”"

Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
255,2021-02-03,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-sessional-statement-february-2021,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Sessional Statement – February 2021,"Check Against Delivery  Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome everyone back to the Chamber for the resumption of the Second Session of the 19th Legislative Assembly. We have a lot of work ahead of us over the next two months, and I look forward to working in close collaboration and partnership with both sides of this House. We all have the best interests of the Northwest Territories and its people in mind, and as we make progress on the priorities of this Legislative Assembly, it will be for the benefit of current and future generations of NWT residents. Mr. Speaker, the last year has been one of the most challenging times the Northwest Territories and its residents have ever experienced. When the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in March last year, we turned our attention to what remains today as the most important priority of this government: protecting the health and well-being of our residents and communities. The rising number of cases across southern Canada and the rest of the world has forced millions back into lockdown situations to flatten the curve and protect the integrity of their health care systems. Watching this happen, it is hard not to feel fortunate that we have been able to keep the number of cases in the NWT low. Mr. Speaker, over the last year, we have learned a lot about how to manage a public health crisis of this magnitude. We established pandemic services and initiated a health response as quickly as we could, and it paid off. As we began to better understand how to protect our residents from the threat of COVID-19, we moved our pandemic services under one roof. The COVID-19 Secretariat has been able to improve our services and find ways to lower the costs to taxpayers. This has happened all while supporting the health orders in place and protecting the health and well-being of our territory. The Government of the Northwest Territories successful containment of the public health risk puts us in a position where we can begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. A big part of our success as a territory rests with residents. We have continued to follow the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer and have been diligent in following the public health orders and recommendations. Mr. Speaker, the pandemic has put us to the test like nothing we have ever faced in our lifetime. It has threatened our health, impacted our economic well-being, and disconnected us from the support networks we all rely on. But we rose to the occasion and have all played a part in our collective success. On behalf of all Cabinet, I thank you. Mr. Speaker, a vaccine is here. In the final days of 2020, a FedEx cargo plane landed at the Yellowknife Airport carrying the first doses of the Moderna vaccine. The Department of Health and Social Services, territorial health authorities and all the Government of the Northwest Territories departments worked long hours to develop a vaccination strategy that would ensure we were able to vaccinate seniors, health care workers, and those living in communities with limited health care infrastructure first. We have always said we would protect the most vulnerable, and we have delivered. Since February 1, we have been able to vaccinate over 12,000 residents, and have the highest number of doses administered by province or territory in Canada. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work that has been done by the public service to protect our territory. They have heeded the call and put the lives of residents and the communities they live in before their own. Just last month, we had our first community outbreak. A scenario that we all hoped would never happen. It was all hands-on deck to protect Fort Liard and limit the possibility of a serious outbreak of COVID-19. Health care professionals went into the community to do contact tracing and rapid testing. We worked closely with local leadership to ensure they could support their residents. We went door-to-door to provide information in English and Dene Zhatie. We worked with local leadership to ensure residents had access to food and essentials. Mr. Speaker, our emergency response effort ensured we were able to protect the community. While we are making progress in our vaccination efforts, it is important to remember that we all must continue to abide by the public health orders and recommendations put forward by the Chief Public Health Officer. Mr. Speaker, its been evidence-based decision-making that has put us in the position we are today to begin to see a Northwest Territories post-pandemic. We are all feeling the growing fatigue of the pandemic. This has been a long and difficult year, but it has been our resilience that has got us to where we are. As the second wave has swept across southern Canada and the world, leading to restrictive measures and lockdowns, we believe we are in a good position to weather the storm because of our pandemic response. Mr. Speaker, managing the public health crisis is essential. Managing it well puts us in a better position to start to shift our attention to social and economic recovery, and how we preserve business. Especially those sectors hit hardest, like tourism and hospitality. A coordinated response to the pandemic includes economic stability and we recognize the importance of both maintaining the financial viability of our businesses and protecting the health of residents. The health and well-being of all communities and residents is best served by maintaining a stable economic environment. Our government has acted to mitigate the economic impacts of this crisis on our economy by investing in NWT industry and businesses. The pandemic caused a steep economic decline in the NWT. Just as it did in other jurisdictions throughout Canada and around the world.  The NWT is recovering from this economic downturn. The GNWT and federal government recognized the economic hardship dealt by the pandemic and worked quickly to provide much needed supports for NWT residents and businesses. Mr. Speaker, we will continue to work with the federal government as we design our recovery strategy. Our economic response has been supported greatly by the federal government. We have received over $120 million in funding to cover the costs of our pandemic response, which includes economic injections for the airline industry, tourism, mining, and small businesses. The relationship we have been able to build with Canada has played a significant part in supporting residents and businesses through this unprecedented time. We recognize that many of these NWT public health measures have placed an economic and financial burden on our residents.  Until the health crisis is brought under control though, a full recovery of the NWT economy will be slow. Mr. Speaker, recovery is key. We need to ensure our people have jobs and our businesses are thriving. We must keep housing, food security, children’s needs, health, and education, top of mind to improve the lives of all NWT residents. We need to manage the immediate risk of the COVID-19 pandemic while we continue to advance our long-term priorities, particularly when it comes to growing our economy, and ensuring a healthy, vibrant, and educated territory for years to come. We have responded to the pandemic in a variety of ways, including efforts to mitigate the economic impacts of this crisis on our economy, and to invest in the economic well-being of Northwest Territories industry and businesses. We knew that for our economy to recover, we would need our mines and supporting industries to be operating, small businesses to be open, and our people to be working. Tourism is a critical part of the economy, and we are committed to ensuring its recovery. We need the jobs tourism creates, the entrepreneurial opportunities it generates, the infrastructure that supports it and the revenue that all of this provides to our economy. Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 has changed how we as a government will need to support tourism in coming years, and we are committed to ensuring that this important part of our economy begins to flourish once again. One of our government’s guiding principles is to ensure that the expenditure of public funds maximizes economic benefits to Northerners and supports Northern business. This is consistent with our longstanding commitment to support Northwest Territories businesses and grow a strong, diversified economy. Government procurement and contracting is a source of economic activity throughout the NWT, and residents and businesses should benefit as much as possible.  At the end of the day we want more NWT residents working and advancing their careers and more businesses thriving and growing in our territory. Mr. Speaker, we have committed in our mandate to work with NWT businesses to strengthen GNWT procurement policies and practices and we are moving ahead with a review of these policies to strike a balance between supporting Indigenous and NWT businesses and the principles of public procurement. As we plot our social and economic recovery, the business community, NGOs, all levels of government, and residents will all play an important role in helping to identify needed actions and investments. By applying the invaluable experience and insight into our decision making, I am confident that we can move forward and emerge from this crisis to revitalize, strengthen and grow our economy and social fabric into the future. We will continue to focus on our economic and social recovery, how we preserve business, and ensure as much of this investment stays in the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, infrastructure projects will play a significant role in our economic recovery. The Legislative Assembly sees this need, and that is why a $451 million capital budget was approved for 2021-2022. Injecting money into the economy will provide business and employment opportunities for residents, while delivering the critical infrastructure the NWT needs to provide important programs and services. This is one of the largest capital investments in the history of the territory and creating jobs and business opportunities will help us grow the economy and ensure a more prosperous future. Mr. Speaker, the 19th Legislative Assembly has set an ambitious mandate, and because of the unexpected shift in priority to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have even less time to complete it. Advancing the mandate requires teamwork and collaborative partnerships to create the meaningful change we are all seeking. Every member of this Legislative Assembly plays an important role in our collective success. I have the full faith in Cabinet, Regular Members, along with our dedicated public service to meet our mandate commitments and work together for NWT residents. Mr. Speaker, a fundamental part of our success as a government, and the future prosperity of our territory, depends on a productive and collaborative partnership with Indigenous, community and municipal governments. The decisions we make as a government must reflect our commitment to reconciliation and the affirmation and advancement of Indigenous rights and self- determination. We must continue to foster constructive and respectful government-to-government relationships with our Indigenous partners and to seek ways to advance reconciliation, recognize and affirm Indigenous rights, and support expanded program and service delivery. We are leaders in reconciliation, and this will continue to be one of our most important priorities as a government. The last year has laid bare the gaps in our society, and the impact of COVID-19 has dramatically revealed the inequities and vulnerabilities of the NWT. Mr. Speaker, these are our realities, and we will need to keep these top of mind as we work to close the gap between Northern and southern Canada that existed long before COVID-19.  We must work toward resilient people and a resilient economy and we will continue to pursue infrastructure and economic development opportunities that provide sustainable benefits. The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to finding ways to make things better for NWT residents. In order to achieve this, we need to build a strong partnership with Canada to take real action on those areas where northerners have said that more needs to be done. We need a strong investment partner in Canada, Mr. Speaker, and one very concrete way the federal government can support economic recovery is by investing in our infrastructure needs. By investing in large-scale infrastructure projects, we can help bridge the substantial infrastructure gap that exists here in the NWT, as well as kick-start the territory’s economic recovery. This is an ambitious request, but one that will benefit the North and ensure we have a future where our residents live in a more prosperous territory. It is about giving the economy the boost it needs and planning for the future.  Mr. Speaker, we all want a brighter future for NWT residents.

The purpose of this year’s roundtable was to foster engagement and participation about what all levels of government, non-government organizations, community service providers, and the private sector can do collectively to address food security. The 47 participants at the Roundtable included representatives from Indigenous governments, community governments, non-governments, industry and the federal government. The roundtable participants discussed GNWT food security programming, visioning, harvesting, local food production, Indigenous food sovereignty, and methods to promote collaboration to maximize impact in addressing food insecurity. The GNWT continues to take action to support residents in accessing local sources of fresh food and ensuring future generations have the skills they need to feed their families through its renewed Territorial Anti-Poverty Action Plan, Sustainable Livelihoods Action Plan, and the Agriculture Strategy. Quote “Food insecurity continues to be a major issue in our territory and the issue is further compounded by the rising costs of transportation and food prices.  The GNWT continues to take action but will take collective efforts to increase food production and decrease hunger.  The value of these roundtables is the opportunity to learn from one another, and take  a coordinated approach to tackle food insecurity. - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick facts The GNWT is committed to reducing poverty in the NWT by working with its partners to advance the Territorial Anti-Poverty Action Plan.

This document has been developed for use by health care providers. A key component of the referral process outlined in the document eliminates the need for a psychiatrist to diagnose an NWT patient with gender dysphoria, which used to be a common requirement in Canada before an individual  could obtain health care services. It is anticipated that the referral process, as set out in the Guidelines, will reduce lengthy wait times for these health care services. These Guidelines were developed with the support of experts within the Department of Health and Social Services and a Workforce Diversity Officer from Human Resources, experienced primary care practitioners, patient advocates, and the Rainbow Coalition of Yellowknife. Quote “These guidelines were developed to help NWT health care providers better serve transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming individuals through the establishment of a clear referral process for accessing health care services. This change is part of  our commitment to embed cultural safety and relationship-based care in the Health and Social Services system,” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick facts The Guidelines were presented to physicians during their grand round and disseminated to nurses and other health care providers.

Simpson, announced new regulations under the Residential Tenancies Act to replace those put in place on April 9, 2020 to help tenants impacted by COVID-19. The new regulations will allow for the establishment of rent repayment plans to ensure tenants have a reasonable timeframe to pay back rent that has accumulated from March 18, 2020 to January 31, 2021 as a result of the pandemic. Beginning February 1, 2021, landlords and tenants have one year to enter into a repayment plan. This will allow tenants to maintain their housing and provide them with at least 12 months to repay their rental arrears.  Under the regulations, either landlords or tenants may initiate a repayment plan, and tenants will not have to make their first payment until at least 30 days after the date a repayment plan is given. Repayment plans must set out: the date the repayment period starts; the total amount of rent still owed;  the amount the tenant must pay each month, with the total owing divided into equal instalments; and the due date of each instalment.  Recognizing that many tenants and landlords worked together to make arrangements during this crisis, prior repayment agreements that cover the total amount of rent owing remain in place and are not cancelled by this new regulation.  The regulations leave some flexibility for landlords and tenants to make changes to the standard terms that are otherwise included in all repayment plans. For example, allowing lower payments in the beginning of the agreement and gradually increasing the payment amounts over time or extending the duration of the repayment process past the 12-month period. Quote “COVID-19 has touched all aspects of our lives and our economy. In April, we announced regulations to allow tenants to defer rental payments if their incomes were negatively impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, we want to take a measured approach to tenancy rules and give people advance notice so they can plan to pay back any owing rent. These changes will help tenants maintain their housing and provide them with a 12 month period to gradually pay back any unpaid rent. We encourage landlords and tenants to work together during this difficult time.” - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Justice Quick facts In the Northwest Territories, the relationship between tenants and landlords is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act which lays out the responsibilities and rights of both tenants and landlords, and establishes a process for resolving disputes.  The new regulations deal with situations where tenants were unable to pay their rent because they lost their job or had their income significantly reduced due to COVID-19, and who have now accumulated arrears of rent that they owe.

The Mandate of the 19th Legislative Assembly identified increasing the number of affordable homes and reducing core housing need as a key priority. One of the actions identified under this priority is to transition individuals or families to homeownership through the sale of units or lease-to-own agreements for existing housing units. Under the leadership of Minister Chinna, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation has doubled its efforts to achieve results in creating homeownership and will be stepping up its work to transition its inventory of detached public housing units into homes.  Through the new Lease-to-Own policy, the NWTHC will also support expanding homeownership through either the conversion of our homeownership rental portfolio into ownership, or through the sale of public housing. The program will be available to all income earning families that are residing in a detached public housing unit and can afford the cost of operating and maintaining their own home. The Housing Corporation is reaching out to tenants to inform them of the opportunities provide them with an opportunity to transition to homeownership. Currently, the NWTHC is has seven units in the process of being sold in Behchokǫ̀.  Quote “In order to assist NWT Residents in reaching their goals of homeownership, we must look for creative ways to address housing needs while to creating opportunities for residents to become homeowners where possible. I am excited that we are moving forward with this approach to support residents with successfully reaching their goals. The units will be in good condition and healthy and safe to occupy.  New homeowners will have full access to the NWTHC’s repair programs, including access to building supplies and services from Local Housing Organizations in communities where they are not available.” - Paulie Chinna, Minister Responsible for the NWT Housing Corporation and Addressing Homelessness Quick facts Increasing the level of homeownership has been extremely difficult for several years due to significant construction costs and difficulty for residents to obtain bank financing. The NWTHC will convert its homeownership rental portfolio into ownership beginning in early 2021.  This portfolio has 221 homes.

273,2021-01-20,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/changes-housing-repair-program-policies-seniors,Government Website,Changes to Housing Repair Program Policies for Seniors,"The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is committed to providing effective and considerate programming that meets the needs of seniors. Today Paulie Chinna, the Minister Responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation (NWTHC) is pleased to announce amendments to the housing repair programming policies for seniors. These amendments remove the requirement for home insurance, formal land tenure, and only assess the incomes of seniors who own their homes. The 19th Legislative Assembly identified increasing supports for seniors to stay in their homes and communities as a key priority for this government. The GNWT has amended NWTHC policies to support more seniors in accessing housing supports to age-in place. In the past, assessments included the incomes of all income earners in the household.  Under these changes, the assessment of household income will only consider the income of the applicant and co-applicant. The GNWT recognizes that in rural and remote communities, it can be challenging to get home insurance and land tenure. Effective immediately, seniors and all residents of smaller communities, will no longer be required to have home insurance or land tenure in order to access NWTHC home repair programs. However, the NWTHC will continue to counsel program participants in obtaining home insurance and land tenure to ensure the security of their homes. Residents of Fort Simpson, Fort Smith, Hay River, Inuvik, Norman Wells and Yellowknife will still be required to have insurance and land tenure when accessing the major repair stream of the Contributing Assistance for Repairs and Enhancements program (CARE Major). Quote “Programming for seniors is an utmost priority for this government, we are always looking at ways to improve our programs and make them more accessible to residents of the NWT. These changes will put an end to situations where seniors cannot access assistance for repairs in smaller communities and allow them to remain in their homes and communities, where they are surrounded by the support of their families and friends.” - Paulie Chinna, Minister responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation and Addressing Homelessness Related links Contributing Assistance for Repairs and Enhancements program (CARE) general information NWTHC Repair and Maintenance Resources NWTHC Programs and Services   Media Requests, please contact: Cara Bryant Communications Assistant Northwest Territories Housing Corporation Government of the Northwest Territories Cara_Bryant@gov.nt.ca"

With me here today are Health and Social Services Minister Julie Green and Chief Public Health Officer for the Northwest Territories, Dr. Kami Kandola.  I want to start off with updates on the situation in Fort Liard. Over the weekend it was announced that there were three confirmed cases of COVID-19, with the likelihood of more to come. In an effort to limit the spread of the virus, the Chief Public Health Officer issued a 14-day containment order for the community. The GNWT is working closely with community leadership and will be supporting all efforts to contain the spread of the virus.  We have heard that there are concerns within the community about being able to get the information they need, in the languages they need, to ensure they are well-informed and able to make appropriate decisions. I have been in regular contact with local leadership to make sure the GNWT is supporting them how they need during this time. The community of Fort Liard is in good hands – their leadership is working night and day for residents.  If you are looking for general information on COVID-19, its symptoms, the current status of COVID-19, or rules and recommendations for folks in the NWT, first visit www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19. If you prefer phone, or you’re having trouble finding information, please call 8-1-1. If you need to arrange for COVID-19 testing, you’re not feeling well, or you’ve been contacted as a result of a potential exposure, contact the local health centre. There will be daily updates on the containment order that will be provided to radio stations, including the local community station, so please tune in for those updates regularly.  As you are aware, the NWT vaccination plan is rolling out across the NWT. We have come a long way since March last year when the pandemic created stress and uncertainty for many of us as to what the future would hold. It has been a challenging road to get to this point, but we are making significant progress in protecting residents and communities from COVID-19. We are moving in a direction where we will be able to further limit the spread of the virus and reduce the potential risk of significant impacts to our health care system. When my time comes to get the vaccine, I will book my appointment like other residents are being asked to and look forward to contributing to the solution that will allow us to move forward. The NWT business community is an important part of our territorial economy, and I want to thank the those who have been doing their part to protect residents, and ensure we are able to keep our case numbers low. We know the restrictions in place have had a significant impact on the small business community, particularly in the tourism and hospitality sectors. And while it has been difficult, I am encouraged by the innovation and resiliency of business owners who have found ways to continue to deliver good and services that our residents rely on. The health and well-being of all communities and residents is best served by maintaining a stable economic environment. This will be achieved with continued strong public health response, enhanced pandemic services delivered by the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat, and the collective efforts of the private sector to adapt and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the vaccine roll out progresses, many want to know when public health restrictions will open up, and travel restrictions will be lessened. We haven’t made it this far on luck – we have listened to our health care professionals and have made decisions based on scientific evidence. Because of this, we have been spared the crushing cases and lockdowns in place elsewhere in Canada and around the world. I wish I could say with certainty when things will begin to open up – but we need residents and businesses to hang on a little longer. The light at the end of the tunnel is near, but many of the risk factors are beyond our control, and we need to remain vigilant.  ProtectNWT and 811 provide access for the public to critical services in our response to COVID, including self-isolation plans, exemption requests, and public health information. It is important for public health that these services provide consistent and clear communications in a timely manner. As you may be aware, ProtectNWT and 811 were experiencing some issues with their phone system recently. I can tell you now that there are currently no issues with the system, but I encourage residents to let the COVID-19 Secretariat know of any issues you may encounter. We care committed to delivery high-quality service, so please let us know if you encounter any challenges when calling.  When the pandemic began, we moved quickly to stand up pandemic services that would protect our residents, like isolation centres. When the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat was established last Fall, we committed to finding ways to better reduce our costs for the pandemic services. Understanding that there were economic opportunities that could benefit northern businesses, the Secretariat issued a public request for tenders in December for isolation centre services in the four hub communities. I’m happy to report that a total of 76 standing offer agreements have been reached with Northern businesses to provide accommodations, meals, alternate accommodations like bed and breakfasts, catering, security, and transportation services.  By having several accommodations options and we are better able to meet the various needs of those accessing our services. This has, in some cases, allowed a greater number of northern businesses to benefit from COVID Secretariat isolation centre opportunities in each of the hub communities. Last week, we announced Statistics Canada is working in partnership with the GNWT to conduct symptom checks. The completion of mandatory symptom checks is a requirement of the NWT Public Health Orders and part of approved Self-Isolation Plans. If you have travelled out of the NWT, you are required to complete symptom checks on Days 2, 6, 10 and 14 after you entered the NWT. By completing regular symptom checks, the risk of transmitting COVID-19 is decreased. Statistics Canada staff are now working with ProtectNWT staff by completing over-the-phone symptom checks with people self-isolating in the NWT. Statistics Canada is utilizing staff from their Western Canada region, which includes representatives from British Columbia and Alberta, who are trained to make calls and conduct surveys to Northerners. So, if you are wondering why someone is calling from a different area code and asking you questions about symptoms during isolation, this is the reason why. Statistics Canada representatives are collecting this on behalf of the GNWT and your information remains confidential.   I want to again thank everyone for doing their part to continue protecting our communities for COVID-19. I’d now like to turn it over to Minister Green to provide her remarks. Thank you. "
276,2021-01-19,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-media-briefing-january-19-2021,Government Website,"Julie Green, Media Briefing, January 19, 2021 ","Good morning and thank you, Premier Cochrane. I would like to begin today’s briefing by thanking all of our frontline staff who are working to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine to our residents and to provide COVID-19 testing in each of our communities. The hours are long and the job is difficult, and I applaud everyone who is a part of it.  Before I provide an update on vaccine delivery, I would like to speak to the Report on Social Indicators: COVID-19 Pandemic that was released yesterday. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is having a lasting impact on individuals, communities, and governments in the NWT and across the globe. The GNWT  response to prevent COVID-19 infection has included a wide range of public health measures to prevent exposure and reduce transmission.  Some of these measures have, directly or indirectly, produced unintended consequences such as  social isolation, loss of employment, diminished quality of life, or harms related to substance abuse.  The Report on Social Indicators: COVID-19 Pandemic examines the potential social impacts created by the protective health measures put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19. It reports on indicators such as child maltreatment, mental health and addictions, alcohol-related harm, and family violence.  Some key findings  of the report’s findings include: a decrease in child maltreatment reported during the first phase of COVID-19 response, compared to the prior year; residents were accessing mental supports through the health system and anonymous help lines more frequently than community counselling; alcohol-related medical visits were higher in May, June and July compared to the same months in 2019; admissions to family violence shelters were lower in 2020 than in previous years; and the was an increase in the number of Emergency Protection Orders issued during those three months.  When the public health measures were first implemented, the GNWT took action to reduce the risk of unintended consequences by: Establishing a working group to identify and interpret a variety of social indicators to examine the social impacts of COVID-19 and public health measures.  		  Increasing the number of virtual contacts with children and families to mitigate child protection concerns. We also sent letters to leaders asking them to note any safety concerns in their communities and to report to local child and family services offices. Increasing the frequency of our advertising for key services such as family violence shelters, community counselling programs, and help lines, as well as  moving to more virtual supports where possible. Providing short-term financial support to families who cannot get assistance from other GNWT programs. 		  Providing services to vulnerable residents in Yellowknife at the Arnica Inn, Aspen Apartments, and day shelters.   We will continue to monitor and address gaps in communications and service delivery to ensure residents are supported during this pandemic. The data provided in this report will be updated quarterly to reflect the current status and expanded to include other indicators as they become available.   I would now like to update you on the progress we’ve made with our vaccine delivery.  As of January 18, we have delivered 1893 first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in the Northwest Territories. This number is updated weekly, every Monday, on the COVID-19 website along  with reporting to the Public Health Agency of Canada. I am grateful to the local health care staff, travelling vaccine teams, community leaders and residents who are working together to protect the NWT from COVID-19. This truly is the Northern way. Residents can get the most up-to-date information on vaccine clinics by visiting www.nthssa.ca/covid-vaccine. This information is shared with community radio stations, media, local health care staff, community leaders, and on social media to help spread the word to all residents.  Depending on the community, priority populations may be offered the vaccine in phases or all at once. We ask for everyone’s patience if the schedule needs to change due to weather or other logistical challenges. It’s also important to remember that you need both doses of the vaccine – ideally 4 weeks apart – to be considered immunized against COVID-19.  Now that the Yellowknife COVID-19 vaccine clinics have opened up to residents 60 and older, I realize it has been challenging to get through and make an appointment. If you are unable to speak directly to someone or leave a message, please go to www.nthssa.ca and click on “Yellowknife Appointment Bookings” under the “Quick Links” section of the main webpage. There, you can fill out a form to request a callback. Public health staff is working extremely hard to answer all requests for appointments, and I can assure you that any eligible NWT resident who wants the vaccine will get one.  Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the residents of Fort Liard who are following Dr. Kandola’s containment order, and to residents across the territory who are coming forward for COVID-19 testing following recent public health advisories. You are setting the example for us all, putting the health and safety of others first. I know how difficult it can be to be away from your loved ones, or to not be able to gather as a community. I want to remind you that there are ways to connect while physically apart – through phone calls, text messages, or video chats. And, if you need a little bit of extra support, the NWT Help Line is available 24/7 at 1-800-661-0844. All calls are free and confidential. I will now hand it over to the Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Kami Kandola, to provide the COVID-19 update.   Thank you."

This report was put together by the Department of Health and Social Services, which established a working group in May 2020 to examine the impacts of COVID-19 as a result of public health measure. The key social indicators being monitored include child maltreatment, mental health and addictions, alcohol-related harm, and family violence. Highlights of the report’s findings include: a decrease in child maltreatment during the first phase of COVID-19 response, before reporting similar patterns as in the previous year afterwards; residents accessing mental supports through the health system and anonymous help lines more frequently than through community counselling; increases to alcohol-related medical visits in May, June and July compared to the same months in 2019; decline in admissions to family violence shelters in 2020 than in previous years; and an increase in Emergency Protection Orders during the same time frame. When COVID-19 protective measures were first implemented, the GNWT took the following actions to reduce the risk of unintended consequences: engaged communities to look out for child maltreatment safety concerns and report them to their local Child and Family Services office; communicated that counselling services continued to be available and introduced new ways of accessing them, as well as eliminating wait times; reduced hours of sale at all alcohol retailers and placed a limit on all alcohol sales with a maximum of purchase of $200 and a maximum of six 375 ml bottles of liquor per day; and communicated that family violence shelters remain opened and distributed 150 cell phones through Victim Services providers. The working group will continue to monitor these social indicators to ensure that any gaps in service delivery or communications of available programs and services are addressed. Quote “The GNWT recognizes that the protective measures that were implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19 earlier this year had an impact on all NWT residents. For some, it has impacted their mental health and well-being. This is why we took action to reduce the risk of unintended consequences from these measures. We will continue to monitor and address any gaps in service delivery while responding to this pandemic.” -Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick facts There are three public health orders that are in effect: COVID-19 Relaxing Phase 2 (effective June 12, 2020) Directed at Mineral and Petroleum Industry (June 25, 2020) Travel Restrictions and Self-Isolation Protocol (As Amended December 1, 2020) Interpretation of the data needs to be carefully considered. For example, a decrease in family violence shelter admissions may indicate that women are unsure whether shelters are open, or due to pandemic-related measures it made it more difficult for them to leave there homes.

Until now, these symptom checks have been administered by the Secretariat’s ProtectNWT staff, via direct telephone contact or online submissions.   Statistics Canada has over 1,700 trained interviewers and a robust infrastructure to ensure the personal health information of Canadians is protected and secure. Statistics Canada staff are now working with ProtectNWT staff by completing over-the-phone symptom checks with people self-isolating in the NWT. Statistics Canada is utilizing staff from their Western Canada region, which includes representatives from British Columbia and Alberta, who are trained to make calls and conduct surveys to Northerners. This initiative is funded by the federal government as part of a broader Canada-wide partnership between Statistics Canada and provinces and territories. The GNWT’s participation in the program was arranged through an agreement between Dr. Kami Kandola, NWT Chief Public Health Officer and Statistics Canada. The additional federal resources will ensure the more time-consuming direct-contact checks remain readily available to all isolating travellers wishing to access this form of check-in. GNWT Health Information Services is working closely with Statistics Canada to ensure safety and security of NWT residents’ personal health information.   Quotes: “This partnership with Statistics Canada will allow us to provide personalized over-the-phone symptom checks to anyone self-isolating in the NWT who would rather speak with a person than submit their information electronically. We have been able to limit the number of cases in the NWT because of the strength and resilience of NWT residents who have continued to make sacrifices for the safety of their neighbours and loved ones. I am thankful for all those who continue to follow self-isolation orders.” -Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories and Minister Responsible for the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat   Quick Facts: Individuals self-isolating in the NWT are required to complete a symptom check on the 2nd, 6th, 10th and 14th days following entry into the NWT. On any given day, approximately 350 people in the NWT complete a symptom check resulting from travel outside of the NWT, and approximately 1,200 people are self-isolating. Working with Statistics Canada also provides an opportunity to ensure that travellers adhere to the requirements of completing symptom checks.

Snowmelt and heavy rain in upstream watersheds of the Mackenzie River Basin in 2020 resulted in more suspended sediment (dirt, silt and clay) in surface waters this summer than normal. As a result, concentrations of some metals and hydrocarbons were higher than normal in July for the Slave and Hay Rivers and for a few substances in August in Great Slave Lake.  Substances that are attached to dirt generally do not affect the health of bugs and fish. Water sampling and analysis in the Slave and Hay Rivers in August and September found that concentrations had returned to their normal range. It is normal to see increased suspended sediment, metal and hydrocarbon concentrations when water levels are high as particles within and along the river are carried downstream. These increases are observed every spring with snowmelt, and have lasted longer this year due to prolonged high water levels across most of the Mackenzie River Basin, including the Athabasca, Peace, Hay, Slave and Liard Rivers.  Quote “Healthy water is of the utmost importance to the NWT and its residents. The high water levels we’ve seen this summer and fall in the Northwest Territories were unprecedented and temporarily increased levels of suspended sediments, and some metals and hydrocarbons in the Slave and Hay Rivers.  The data and information we have gathered suggests that impacts to fish are not expected.  We continue to gather information on our water, through the GNWT’s regular water quality and quantity monitoring program, and will continue data sharing efforts as part of our transboundary water agreements to help ensure the waters of the NWT remain clean, abundant and productive for all time.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Quick facts Each year the GNWT monitors water quality in the NWT, including at transboundary sites on the Slave, Hay, Liard and Peel Rivers. The GNWT also monitors Great Slave Lake at Resolution Bay, near the mouth of the Hay River, and Yellowknife Bay in partnership with monitors from the NWT-wide Community-based Water Quality Monitoring program each year. Long-term monitoring provides a record of changes over time, and will help detect changes going forward. The Slave and Hay Rivers were sampled in July, August and September 2020. Great Slave Lake was sampled in August 2020. Heavy rains and run off during the spring and summer of 2020 led to increased suspended sediment in upstream watersheds such as the Peace and Athabasca Rivers as well as our transboundary watersheds such at the Slave and Hay Rivers.  The Slave and Hay Rivers caused the large, persistent milky brown plume observed in Great Slave Lake. Typically, the Slave River has an average water flow of 4,730 cubic metres per second. In July 2020, the average water flow was 7,449 cubic metres per second. That’s an average of almost 7.5 million litres of water passing by the Town of Fort Smith each second.

This change will take effect January 23, 2021. “As the main gateway airport for the NWT, YZF plays an integral role in keeping the north and residents connected while also supporting economic opportunities. Although there are other airlines still serving the North, this change will eliminate some of the options currently afforded to NWT residents when they choose to travel by air.  “NWT residents should take some comfort knowing that essential services provided by our NWT airports will not be impacted by this change. This includes our ability to provide necessary medical travel services that NWT residents depend on to access care and services outside the territory. “The GNWT is obviously disappointed by the news shared by Air Canada today, but understands that businesses must make decisions that they believe best fit with their business model and market conditions. According to Air Canada, the negative impacts of COVID-19 on their operations have been unprecedented and contributed to this difficult business decision. The GNWT looks forward to a time when those conditions change.”"

It is anticipated that seven commercial fishing businesses will participate in this year’s winter fishery. They will be supported by a pilot program introduced by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment (ITI).  The pilot program will run for up to eight weeks and assist fishers with accessing winter-specific gear and equipment. ITI funding will also allow the Tu’Cho’ Co-operative to reopen and operate the Hay River fish plant, which closed for the summer season on October 10th, 2020. The Hay River packing facility will receive and grade fish from commercial fishers in Yellowknife and Hay River then ship them to the federal Fresh Water Fish Marketing Corporation (FFMC) in Winnipeg for processing and sale.    In addition to the pilot program, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is partnering with Indigenous Governments to train community members to participate in the Winter Fishery. This provides an investment to solidify and build capacity for a thriving Winter Fishery into the future.   Guided by its Strategy for Revitalizing the Great Slave Lake Commercial Fishery (2017), the GNWT is working to revitalize the Great Slave Lake Fishing sector and to restore its contributions to the NWT economy.   Quotes This investment is one of many that we are making to re-establish the Great Slave Lake fishery and provide greater returns for fishers. In time, our plan is to see new and year-round jobs in processing, packaging, selling and transporting NWT fish to market; as well as new products including more opportunities for NWT residents to access fresh, healthy, locally-produced food. -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment     We are working with the Government of the Northwest Territories to realize our shared vision of a revitalized Great Slave Lake fishery.  One of the steps that we must take is to secure a year-round supply of fresh Great Slave Lake fish for market.

294,2021-01-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/gnwt-releases-vaccination-strategy,Government Website,GNWT Releases Vaccination Strategy,"Today, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) released the GNWT COVID-19 vaccination strategy titled Immunity for our Communities: The Northwest Territories’ COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy for residents of the Northwest Territories (NWT).  The strategy was developed by the Department of Health and Social Services with  input from Indigenous governments and community leadership. It was also built on recommendations from the National Advisory Council for Immunizations (NACI).  The GNWT approach to vaccination for COVID-19 is grounded in five core values. These include equity, cultural competency, evidence-based decision-making, flexibility and responsiveness, and trust. These values will guide our response teams when delivering vaccinations across the territory.  A phased approach for vaccine delivery began on December 31, 2020. The strategy prioritizes residents who are at highest risk. Residents who fit within the identified priority groups (see below) will receive the vaccine first. The GNWT expects vaccinations to take place between January and February 2021. The general population can expect to have the opportunity to be vaccinated starting in March 2021. Information and resources about the vaccine itself will be hosted at www.gov.nt.ca.  Specific dates and times of vaccine clinics will be updated as additional doses from the federal government arrive in the NWT. There will be regular updates posted to www.nthssa.ca.  The overarching goal of the Immunity for our Communities: The Northwest Territories’ COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy is to provide a safe, effective vaccine against COVID-19 to 75per cent  of the territory’s eligible population 18 years and older.  The GNWT continues to work closely with federal, provincial, and territorial partners throughout the planning and roll out of COVID-19 vaccines in Canada. The unique characteristics of the NWT will continue to play a key role in shaping vaccine distribution within the Northern context. Vaccines, like other public health measures, are most effective when we all do our part. The GNWT urges NWT communities and residents to review trusted sources for vaccine information and check back often for updates on community vaccine schedules.    Quotes:                                                       “We have begun a vaccination plan that is one of the most complex health care efforts the Government of the Northwest Territories has ever had to complete. A collaborative and coordinated approach across all levels of government plays a vital role in our efforts to effectively deliver vaccine doses across the Northwest Territories. I am confident in our health care professionals to deliver the vaccine to 33 communities successfully.” - Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories; Minister Responsible for the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat    “Last week, the GNWT began vaccinating NWT residents. Today we are releasing our complete vaccination strategy. so NWT residents can prepare to receive their vaccine. As I have said before, though vaccinations are not mandatory, vaccine uptake will be especially important to protect those who cannot yet receive the vaccine, including residents who are pregnant, immunocompromised, or less than 18 years of age. I will continue to advocate for the importance of residents to get their vaccine if they’re able to and play their part to protect our loved ones and our communities.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services   Quick facts: ·       The first vaccines were delivered in the NWT December 31, 2020 to long term care residents and staff in Behchoko and Yellowknife. ·       The Moderna vaccine was selected as the most viable vaccine option for all three territories due to its ability to be shipped and stored to remote communities at a normal freezer temperature.  ·       A resident  requires two doses of vaccine given four (4) weeks apart to build immunity  against COVID-19. ·       The Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority has redeployed or hired an additional 43 nurses and 18 logisticians to roll out the vaccine in NWT communities. ·       Travel restrictions and self-isolation requirements will not be lifted immediately upon administration of the vaccine. They will be re-evaluated as vaccination levels rise across the territory, and across Canada.  ·       This phased approach for delivery, as described in the Strategy, identifies priority groups are as follow:  ·       Advanced age: the risk of COVID-19 severity starts to increase after age 60. Most vulnerable in this category are those who live in long-term care facilities or in shared living environments. ·       Existing chronic disease and multiple medical conditions:  residents with conditions like chronic lung, kidney, or heart disease are at greater risk for experiencing severe form of COVID-19 and its complications. Those who travel outside the NWT regularly for medical care are at even greater risk. ·       Likelihood of transmitting COVID-19 to those at high risk of severe illness and death is another important consideration. This risk group may include frontline health care workers, or those who provide care to high risk vulnerable populations. ·       Resident workers who live in NWT but work regularly out of territory  or at work camps with out-of-territory workers are at elevated risk of acquiring COVID-19 and transmitting to family, household members or those in the community. ·       Living in a remote community, including Indigenous communities, with limited health infrastructure in comparison to larger centers.    Related links:    NWT Vaccination Strategy  Community Vaccination Dates  Moderna Information Sheet Vaccination Questions and Answer  GNWT COVID Information  Vaccine development and approval in Canada Vaccine safety in Canada (video)   Canada’s COVID-19 Immunization Plan Immunize Canada     Media Contact Damien Healy Department of Health and Social Services  Government of the Northwest Territories Damien_Healy@gov.nt.ca "

The first group to receive their vaccinations included residents and staff at the Jimmy Erasmus Seniors Home in Behchokǫ̀ and AVENS Manor in Yellowknife. The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) has categorized residents and staff at long term care as among those at highest risk and a priority for immunization. Priority groups for the COVID-19 vaccination in the NWT are as follows: Advanced age: the risk of COVID-19 severity starts to increase after age 60. Most vulnerable in this category are those who live in long-term care facilities or in shared living environments. Existing chronic disease and multiple medical conditions: residents with conditions like chronic lung, kidney, or heart disease are at greater risk for experiencing severe form of COVID-19 and its complications. Those who travel outside the NWT regularly for medical care are at even greater risk. Likelihood of transmitting COVID-19 to those at high risk of severe illness and death is another important consideration. This risk group may include frontline health care workers, or those who provide care to high risk vulnerable populations. Resident workers who live in the NWT, but work regularly outside the NWT or at work camps with out-of-territory workers are at elevated risk of acquiring COVID-19 and transmitting to family, household members or those in the community. Living in a remote community, including Indigenous communities, with limited health infrastructure in comparison to larger centers. These priority groups will receive the vaccination in a phased approach that will be expanded to the entire eligible NWT population as supply increases. The GNWT continues to work towards a target of March 2021 for completion of our vaccination roll out. A team from the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority (NTHSSA) was deployed to vaccinate residents and staff at these two long term care facilities earlier today. The team was made up logisticians, nurses and translators who were also on site to help the local health care staff who are considered the experts in their communities deliver the vaccine.  NWT residents can be confident that top Canadian experts, scientists, and medical professionals carefully reviewed all of the scientific data and evidence for vaccine safety and effectiveness. NWT residents have a choice whether or not they get the COVID-19 vaccine. Even if you are not at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19, getting vaccinated will help protect those around you who might be. Think of your friends, family, co- workers, elders, and other community members. The GNWT encourages all eligible adult residents to get vaccinated.   Quotes: “The global scientific community has been engaged in an unprecedented effort to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, and it has been a long and difficult road to get to this day. We have always been committed to protecting residents and communities, especially our most vulnerable. It has been our commitment to evidence-based decision making, and to listening to the advice of our medical professionals and those in the scientific community that we are on the cusp of beginning to overcome one of the biggest challenges our society has ever faced.” - Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories; Minister Responsible for the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat   “This morning, the GNWT vaccinated NWT residents at the two long term care facilities. I am pleased with how the first day of our vaccination roll has gone and excited about the months ahead as we work to vaccinate the rest of our eligible population. Though vaccinations are not mandatory, vaccine uptake will be especially important to protect those who cannot yet receive the Moderna vaccine, including residents who are pregnant, immunocompromised, or less than 18 years of age. It’s important we all play our part in returning the North to life as we knew it before the pandemic and get vaccinated for the safety of our loved ones.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services    Quick facts: The Moderna vaccine was selected as the most viable vaccine option for all three territories due to its ability to be shipped and stored more easily to remote communities at -20°C. The Pfizer vaccine currently being distributed to other parts of Canada must be stored at -70°C, which requires specialized, costly equipment and presents significant logistical challenges. The NWT received 7200 doses of the Moderna vaccine December 28, 2020 The Moderna vaccine requires two doses given four (4) weeks apart to be considered immunized against COVID-19. Travel restrictions and self-isolation requirements will not be lifted immediately upon administration of the vaccine. Public health measures will continue to be essential to stop the spread of COVID-19. Until enough of the territorial and national population have received both doses of the vaccine and risk of infection is significantly decreased, appropriate public health measures will remain in place.

This is exciting news and puts the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) on track to meet our goal of having 75% of eligible residents 18 years of age or older vaccinated in 2021. The NWT anticipates the first shipment of 7200 doses of the vaccine will be received by the end of December 2020, which is enough for 3600 NWT residents to receive the required 2 doses of the vaccine.   “Now that the vaccine has been approved, the GNWT can finalize our vaccine rollout approach, which will be released in early January 2021. There is still some work to do behind the scenes to get ready for the arrival of the vaccination and implementation of our plan. Hiring, communications, and logistics are key activities that must be complete before vaccination can begin. The GNWT also continues to work with Joint Task Force to ensure the vaccine is distributed as efficiently as possible given the NWT’s unique geography and climate.    “NWT residents can be confident that top Canadian experts, scientists, and medical professionals carefully reviewed all of the scientific data and evidence for vaccine safety and effectiveness. While the vaccine will not be mandatory, the GNWT encourages all eligible adult residents to get immunized to protect themselves and others against COVID-19. Once priority groups at highest risk have been offered the vaccine, roll-out will continue for other residents. Vaccine uptake will be especially important to protect those who cannot yet receive the Moderna vaccine, including residents who are pregnant, immunocompromised, or less than 18 years of age.     “Though many GNWT staff are enjoying some days off to celebrate the holidays, there are still teams working behind the scenes to finalize our robust vaccine rollout plan that will reach each and every NWT community. This is a big undertaking over the holidays, but I have every confidence in the staff from all three health authorities, the Department of Health and Social Services, and our partners at Joint Task Force North, and I look forward to our rollout plan being finalized and shared with NWT residents and media in early 2021.    “I want to reiterate to NWT residents that though the approval of the Moderna vaccine means we’re one step closer to resuming the lives we had before the pandemic started – we are not there yet. The holiday seasons still remains a high risk season for the spread of COVID-19 and NWT residents are reminded to take extra precautions as you enjoy the holidays with your loved ones. Follow the public health orders, wash your hands often, wear your mask, keep your distance and be safe. And remember to stay home if you are sick and get tested. We can see the finish line now, but we all still have a role to play in keeping our families and communities safe.”    Media Contact: Cabinet Communications 						Government of the Northwest Territoriespresssecretary@gov.nt.ca"

Guidelines are based on Public Health Orders and include best practices for making the season merry while protecting ourselves and each other.  Key guidance on celebrating this holiday season includes: ·       If anyone in your household has travelled outside the NWT within the last 14 days, everyone in your household must self-isolate. This is the best way to prevent outbreaks. ·       Educate yourself and watch for COVID-19 symptoms. If you are feeling unwell, even if your symptoms are minor, cancel get-togethers and connect in ways other than in-person. ·       If you are required to self-isolate, do not host others or attend gatherings until your self-isolation period is complete. Ask guests who are required to self-isolate to stay home and connect virtually instead. ·       Consider options such as video calls or video-sharing to keep your physical circle small, while staying connected with friends and family virtually. ·       If you are hosting a holiday dinner, remember the NWT’s indoor gathering limits: you may have 5 people in addition to your household members, up to a maximum of 10 people, indoors at any time. ·       At meals, make sure guests are physically distanced and do not share glasses or cutlery. ·       Avoid physical greetings such as kissing and clinking glasses. Elbow taps and virtual hugs are fine. ·       Other NWT gathering limits: o   Indoor public spaces (i.e. community or banquet halls): up to 25 people with physical distancing, hand-washing, and enhanced cleaning measures in place. o   Outdoor spaces: up to 50 people with physical distancing by household and handwashing. ·       Consider always wearing a mask whenever you are in any a public space. ·       Avoid Christmas carolling and other door-to-door festivities this year. ·       Worship services should not exceed the maximum allowable number of parishioners. Consider virtual options. ·       If you plan to visit a family member in continuing care or hospital, follow all visitor policies carefully. The Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority provides guidelines for these facilities. Non-medical masks are mandatory.   Full Guidelines are available on the GNWT’s COVID-19 response website (link below), including a print-ready document.   Quote “We know the holiday season will look different this year in our territory and around the world. The realities of the COVID-19 pandemic mean we cannot travel and gather as family, friends and community in our usual manner. With creativity and good humor, however, we can all find COVID-safe ways to meaningfully celebrate this beautiful season.”  - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services    Quick facts ·       The risk of COVID-19 infection is much higher over the holidays than any other point during the pandemic. ·       Gatherings where many different people mix are a significant source of recent outbreaks across Canada. The holiday guidelines are designed to help limit these risks – but there will never be no risk.   Related links ·       Holiday Guidelines for the Northwest Territories (print-ready guidelines available)  ·       Self-Isolation Planning   For media requests please contact:  Mike Westwick COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat Government of the Northwest Territories Mike_westwick@gov.nt.ca"
308,2020-12-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-news-conference-gnwt-vaccine-approach,Government Website,"Julie Green: News Conference, GNWT Vaccine Approach ","Check against delivery.  Good afternoon. This is an exciting and long-anticipated day for our territory. As our federal colleagues confirmed yesterday, I am pleased to confirm that the Northwest Territories expects to receive enough of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for 75% of eligible NWT adult residents, 18 years of age or older.  Through 2021 we expect to receive enough vaccine to vaccinate everyone who wants it. That said, I know that residents are anxious to confirm who will be a priority for the first round, along with how and when it will be delivered. Work is well underway confirming this detail for immunization of each NWT community. The vaccination plan will factor in the unique geography and population of our territory along with recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI).  But before this plan is finalized, essential information and collaboration is required.  First, we need to wait for Health Canada to authorize use of the Moderna vaccine in Canada. We don’t expect this to take long. This is a two-dose vaccine, with the second dose delivered about a month after the first dose. Two doses are required to make the vaccine fully effective. Second, we need to know from our Federal colleagues exactly when the first allotted amount of vaccine will arrive in the territory. Delivery is expected between January and March 2021. Third, we need to engage with Indigenous and community governments, who will inform decision-making for vaccine prioritization. Engagement is a critical part of respecting residents and developing a well-rounded, collaborative approach. In the meantime, we are preparing for the vaccine’s arrival. We are establishing vaccine teams made up of nurses and support staff. These teams will travel to communities to help local health care professionals deliver the vaccine to residents. We are also ensuring registered nurses receive specialized COVID-19 vaccine training. We are identifying data management for vaccine documentation and second dose coordination. We are also determining reporting that will meet Public Health Agency of Canada requirements. We are coordinating with the federal government for delivery of supplies such as needles, syringes, alcohol swabs, and personal protective equipment to be used during immunization. Supplies have been set aside specifically for the NWT and will arrive before we receive our first vaccine shipments. Two specialized freezers are on their way from the federal government with enough capacity for the entire territory’s vaccine needs. These freezers will be installed at the Stanton Territorial Hospital and Inuvik Regional Hospital pharmacies to be properly monitored. Portable freezers have been ordered to assist with shipping vaccine to the communities.   Specialists from the Department of Health and Social Services and Health Authorities are working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Operation Centre to coordinate delivery of vaccine to the Northwest Territories. Planning is underway to safely transport vaccine in the North. This is just some of the critical work happening behind the scenes to prepare the NWT for vaccination roll-out. In the coming weeks, we will collaborate with Indigenous and community governments, federal government colleagues, health authorities, and Joint Task Force North to finalize our plan.  I would like to thank everyone involved with this life-saving work, and I look forward to sharing this detailed plan with you in the very near future. I would also like to take a moment to thank the residents of the Northwest Territories for the sacrifices they have made to protect our communities from COVID-19 and will have to continue to make   This vaccine does not mean that self-isolation requirements and travel restrictions will be lifted immediately. Vaccine uptake and decreased rates of COVID-19 infection will be necessary in the NWT and the rest of Canada before we can travel easily. But, this vaccine does bring us one step closer to resuming the lives we had before this pandemic.  Finally, I want to touch on a topic that is top of mind for some residents as COVID-19 cases surge in Alberta. I want to assure you that urgent and emergent care for NWT residents is not impacted at this time. We are considered identical to Alberta residents when it comes to the need for care. That means an Alberta patient will not be prioritized over an NWT resident when their care needs are equally urgent.  The current service reduction in Alberta Health Services is to non-urgent visits and procedures. This reduction is happening across the country in areas where COVID-19 cases are at record highs. Practitioners are also using and promoting virtual care as much as possible to reduce travel to southern jurisdictions.   NWT health system officials will continue to work with colleagues at Alberta Health Services and the federal government to mitigate any potential impacts on health care for NWT residents. Thank you. "

Once authorized for distribution by Health Canada, the NWT will receive enough of the Moderna vaccine to immunize 75% of NWT residents 18 years of age or older.   The Moderna vaccine was selected as the most viable vaccine option for all three territories due to its ability to be shipped and stored more easily to remote communities at -20°C. The Pfizer vaccine currently being distributed to other parts of Canada must be stored at -70°C, which requires specialized, costly equipment and presents significant logistical challenges. The Moderna vaccine requires two doses given four (4) weeks apart to be considered immunized against COVID-19. NWT residents can be confident that top Canadian experts, scientists, and medical professionals carefully reviewed all of the scientific data and evidence for vaccine safety and effectiveness. The GNWT encourages all adult residents to get vaccinated but it will not be mandatory. The GNWT is developing a specialized plan for vaccine delivery based our distinct geography and population, along with recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI). One of the first crucial steps in finalizing this plan is engagement with Indigenous and community governments, which is set to begin next week.  Once priority groups are vaccinated, rollout will continue for other residents. The GNWT will continue to work closely with the Federal Government and Joint Task Force North to confirm timing and logistics. Vaccine delivery will be supported with comprehensive communications to help inform residents and build confidence in the vaccine. In the meantime, residents should continue to follow the public health orders including social distancing, wearing a non-medical mask and frequently sanitizing hands.   Quotes “It has been a long and difficult road to get to this day – but it has been our commitment to evidence-based decision making, and listening to the advice of our medical professionals and those in the scientific community that we are on the cusp of beginning to overcome one of the biggest challenges our society has ever faced.  It has always been the top priority of the Government of the Northwest Territories to protect residents and communities from the threat of the virus – and as we begin to roll out the vaccine to residents in coming months, we all must continue to do our part to protect one another.” - Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories; Minister Responsible for the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat   “Getting NWT residents vaccinated for COVID-19 will bring us one step closer to resuming the lives we had before this pandemic, but it will still take some time. Extensive work is underway to develop a plan for immunization of each NWT community. Our plan will factor in the unique geography and population of our territory along with recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. Public health orders will continue to be reviewed by the Chief Public Health Officer as vaccination rates rise inside and outside our borders.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services    Quick facts ·       On December 10, the Federal government announced the NWT will receive enough of the Moderna vaccine to immunize 75% of the population.  ·       Health Canada authorization of the Moderna vaccine is required before roll-out can begin. Authorization documents will include key information necessary for vaccine prioritization planning. ·       Extensive work is well underway developing the complex immunization plan for entire territory.

After close consideration of the needs of NWT students and communities, as well as the operational realities of NWT schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment has decided to make diploma exams optional for NWT students. Students and their guardians will be able to decide for themselves whether to write diploma exams during the 2020-21 school year.  Students in diploma exam courses who do not write diploma exams will automatically receive exemptions and their school awarded mark will stand for 100% of their final mark.  This option will be available for the January 2021, April 2021, June 2021, and August 2021 diploma exam writing sessions.   Since writing diploma exams will be on an opt-in basis, those who wish to write the January 2021 diploma exams must notify their school by Tuesday, December 15.   Quick facts •                     Students who wish to write the January 2021 diploma exams must submit an opt-in form to their school by Tuesday, December 15.   •                     If a student chooses to write the exam, the exam mark will be blended with the student’s school mark. The exam is worth 30% of the student’s mark and the school mark is worth 70%. •                     If a student chooses not to write the diploma exam, their school awarded mark will stand for 100% of their final course mark.  •                     Students who choose to write a diploma exam but are dissatisfied with their mark are not eligible for an exemption. •                     To find out whether a student needs to write a diploma exam to apply to a specific post-secondary institution, students and their guardians are responsible for contacting the post-secondary institution.   Quote(s) “The Government of the Northwest Territories is working with all of our education partners to create a supportive and effective learning environment for students.  This decision comes after consideration of both the impacts of COVID-19 on the school system, students and their families and the way that education delivery has been modified for the current school year.” - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “Education Leaders agree with the decision taken by the Government of the Northwest Territories where diploma exams are concerned and appreciated having had the opportunity to contribute to the discussion.  Equity for all graduate students, no matter their individual circumstance, is what we are striving for.  Those students that wish to write the diploma exams continue to have the option to do so.  We strongly encourage all students that are registered in courses that include diploma exams to carefully consider their choice of postsecondary studies and their requirements prior to taking this important decision.” -Simon Cloutier, CSFTNO representing all Education Leaders     For all Media Requests, please contact:  Jaimee Kepa Government of the Northwest Territories  jaimee_kepa@gov.nt.ca "

Beginning on January 5, 2021, the GNWT will no longer cover costs for isolation centre stays related to discretionary or personal travel.  This means those travelling for leisure purposes will need to pay for their own self-isolation costs if they require stays in an isolation centre.

The GNWT will continue to cover costs for isolation centre stays related to:  ·       Medical travel ·       Medically-Advised Self-Isolation ·       Compassionate travel  ·       Unforeseen or exceptional circumstances.    This shift responds to engagement with Indigenous government leadership, community governments, and business stakeholders – and to the urging of the Chief Public Health Officer for everyone to avoid all non-essential travel outside the NWT.  In addition to these changes, enforcement of the protocols for behaviour in the self-isolation centers will be stepped up. Non-compliance may result in a warning and repeated non-compliance may result in a fine of $1,725. It is important to manage the risk of COVID-19 by having people staying in isolation centres remain isolated for the whole 14-day period. While the risk with record-levels of cases across Canada is currently too high, work will continue on building durable, safe solutions for expanding self-isolation locations at an appropriate time and with continued input from Indigenous and community leadership.    Revised Travel Restriction and Self-Isolation Protocol Order On November 16 and 17, the Chief Public Health Officer issued verbal orders related to the Nunavut travel bubble and changes to the self-isolation protocol A written amendment has been issued revising the July 16 Travel Restriction Order and Self Isolation Protocol to include these verbal orders from the CPHO specifically removing the Nunavut bubble and including the new self-isolation requirements.   This ensures that everyone impacted by the travel restrictions and self-isolation is aware of their obligations.    Quotes “Keeping NWT communities and residents safe from COVID-19 is a priority for our government right now, and that includes eliminating all non-essential travel outside of the territory.

Problematic substance use continues to be a serious public health issue in the Northwest Territories.  To ensure progress in addressing this issue, coordinated efforts among governments, communities and stakeholders are needed.  Integrating the views and priorities of Indigenous Governments and communities in decision making and providing public education on alcohol and other harmful drugs are keys to protect the health and safety of residents. This funding will support the Government of Northwest Territories (GNWT) in engaging with Indigenous Governments and Organizations, Community Governments and Non-Government Organizations to identify community-specific priorities and views, share promising evidence-based practices, and develop collaborative initiatives and approaches to addressing problematic use of alcohol and other harmful drugs within communities.  This funding will also be used to support public engagement for the development of a comprehensive public awareness campaign on alcohol and other drugs. This work will be led by the Territorial Committee on Problematic Substance Use, represented by GNWT Departments, members of the public and the Northwest Territories Association of Communities. Feedback from these engagements will help support the development of a territorial alcohol strategy.   Quotes “There is no one-size-fits-all approach to addressing substance abuse. It is only by working with Indigenous Governments and Communities on a coordinated approach to take action on alcohol and substance misuse that we will be able to see progress on addressing this serious public health issue. This federal investment will support this coordinated approach to protecting the health and safety of our residents and communities. ”  - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services   “Problematic substance use has devastating effects on individuals, families and communities. We recognize that the most successful strategies include elements of prevention, treatment and harm reduction, and are guided by the needs identified by the clients and communities they serve. We are pleased to support the Government of Northwest Territories, Indigenous leaders and organizations, communities, families and individuals across the region, in your efforts to provide help and hope to those affected.” - The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Indigenous Services Canada   Quick facts ·       Results from the 2018 NWT Addictions Survey showed: o   33% of overall respondents reported being current smokers o   74% of respondents had a drink in the past 12 months o   47% of males and 39% of females report heavy drinking at least once per month (where heavy drinking entails consuming four or more drinks on one occasion for females and five or more drinks on one occasion for males).This is significantly higher than the 2018 national average of 19.1%  (Statistics Canada) o   41% of NWT residents report cannabis use in the past year o   Cocaine continues to be the illicit drug of choice for respondents (16% have ever used cocaine, 4% in the past 12 year) o   Hallucinogens (not including ecstasy, MDMA) are also popular (26% ever tried, 5.2% in past 12 months) ·       Overall per person costs attributed to substance abuse in the NWT was $2,329.

We recognize the need to reduce the core housing need across the NWT, we also know that we cannot accomplish this on our own, we need our partners at the table to achieve this goal. “The $60 million is federal money that is allocated to the NWT, not the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT). This fund is to support Indigenous governments, stakeholder and the private sector to apply for 75% dollars to support any local housing project, 25% dollars can be provided by the NWTHC, but that 25% can also come from outside of government as well. The federal funding also provides proposal money up to $150, 000.  “We realize that the application process could be and should be better and I have pressed the Federal government to make improvements, including speaking directly to my counterpart, the Honourable Ahmed Hussen about these processing times. As a result of these conversations, the CHMC has committed to cutting the process time for applications in half. “There is a suggestion that no progress has been made with regards to this fund. Without breaking confidentiality of the application process, I can say that there are over a dozen projects within the NWT that are at various stages of review.  “A full presentation on the Housing Co-investment Fund was provided to Indigenous leadership at the Northern Housing Summit held in Inuvik from April 23-24, 2019. Further, the GNWT is committed to continuing to support the implementation of this federal program throughout the NWT, including presentations to Community leadership to raise awareness of this funding.  “NWTHC is working closely with the Federal Government to spend this money and get new housing on the ground, especially in communities.  “Recently, the NWTHC has created a Community engagement advisor to promote and market this program and its funding, to assist developers with the applications and also to help communities clarify and identify projects they want to see move forward. 					“I am confident that the work we are doing through the NWTHC, that in the coming months the federal government and the GNWT will be in a position to indicate significant housing projects going forward for 2021.  “For anyone that is looking for information or requires assistance in applying, please reach out to the NWTHC. We want to help.  We want to see our residents in homes. Together we can see significant housing projects develop throughout the NWT.”   https://www.nwthc.gov.nt.ca/en/contact-information https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/nhs/co-investment-fund?fbclid=IwAR09zUp57yKtTZWkW5DGRm7H0bYSukWmlZUVelsL4ZnbR74HDHYlVrgD_ik"

The report provides a summary of input received about self-isolation locations and payment for isolation centre stays from Indigenous governments, community governments and business stakeholders. The Secretariat held engagement sessions between October 28 and November 3, 2020 to seek input about communities where people could self-isolate and who should pay for individuals to stay in isolation centres. Participants communicated different experiences and ideas that emerge as key themes in the What We Heard report. The results show there are differing points of view about self-isolating at home in smaller communities. Most of feedback was in support of reducing isolation centre costs to taxpayers. The report is one of many tools that informs the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) about viewpoints across the territory. The What We Heard report reflects only the discussion of opinions and concerns of those who took part. The discussions were based on a paper that was provided to stakeholders in advance of the sessions, titled Self-Isolation and Our Communities: Exploring solutions for expanding self-isolation options safely and controlling isolation centre costs. The OCPHO and the Secretariat have also heard from representatives through letters and previous comments provided to other government departments.   Quote “Our government is committed to carrying out meaningful dialogue with stakeholders, including Indigenous leaders, community governments, and the business community. It’s important we hear, value, and learn from different perspectives as we make decisions. A coordinated and collaborative approach to making public health order decisions will allow the GNWT to determine how best to assist each unique community when it comes to carrying them out.”  - Caroline Cochrane, Premier      Related links ·       What We Heard Report  ·       The GNWT's Common Approach to Public Engagement ·       Mandatory Self-Isolation     For all COVID-19 Media Requests, please contact:  Cabinet Communications Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

Residents may see and hear the public alert test on wireless devices, radio stations and cable networks across the NWT. NWT Alert is being developed to provide public alerts to NWT residents during emergencies and disasters and is part of the national public alerting system “Alert Ready”. The NWT system is currently under development with full implementation expected in 2021.  It is important to note that not all residents will receive the test alert on their wireless device. This may occur for a variety of reasons, including device compatibility, connection to an LTE network, cell tower coverage, device software and settings. The public is encouraged to check their device compatibility on their wireless service provider’s website and ensure that their device has the latest software update installed. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission set the target that 100% of new devices currently available for sale in Canada as of April 2019 be compatible and able to receive emergency alerts. Over time, more residents will have devices that are compatible and will be able to receive emergency alerts. Alert Ready is designed to deliver critical and potentially life-saving alerts to Canadians through television, radio and wireless devices.  The Alert Ready system is developed in partnership with federal, provincial and territorial emergency management officials, Environment Canada and the broadcast industry to ensure you receive alerts immediately and know when to take action to keep yourself and your family safe.

The GNWT introduced three rounds of economic stimulus measures to help support airlines and businesses that operate at all NWT airports that are being impacted by COVID-19.  The first round of stimulus measures included the waiving of Airport Landing Fees from March 20 to June 30, 2020.  The second round included waiving Leases, Licenses and Concession fees for all businesses at all airports from April 1 to June 30, 2020.  Both measures were extended from July 1 to December 31, 2020. Together, these relief measures provided an estimated $6,300,000 in financial support for all businesses operating at all NWT airports. These measures were implemented automatically with no application process. The GNWT must now take into account the financial situation of its airports and ensure they have the funds to safely operate. The revenue generated through airport fees enables essential investments in airport infrastructure, improvement projects and maintenance activities. Airport maintenance and improvements are especially important in the NWT, where residents and industry depend on safe, secure, accessible and reliable air travel. These investments allow NWT airports to maintain passenger and staff safety and meet regulatory requirements.   For media inquiries, please contact:  Public Affairs and Communications Department of Infrastructure Government of the Northwest Territories INF_Communications@gov.nt.ca "

Many water bodies in the NWT experienced record high water levels during the summer of 2020 due to significant rain and snow. These high water levels have continued during the fall and will likely remain throughout the winter. For example, on Great Slave Lake at Yellowknife Bay, the average water level for this time of year is 156.5 metres. As of November 18, 2020, water levels are approximately 50 centimetres higher than average, at 157 metres. Examples of high flow rates across the NWT are shown in the following table.  Water Body   Average Water Flow   Water Flow (as of Nov 18)   Tazin River (near the mouth)   60 cubic metres per second   372 cubic metres per second (as of Oct 15)   Taltson River (below hydro dam)   215 cubic metres per second   628 cubic metres per second (as of Nov 12)   Lockhart River (at outlet of Artillery Lake)   132 cubic metres per second   249 cubic metres per second   Kakisa River (at outlet of Kakisa Lake)   35 cubic metres per second   125 cubic metres per second (estimated)  High water conditions may mean freeze-up occurs later than usual, may cause thin ice in places where it is normally thicker and stable, and may result in changes in water overflow on land and ice.      With different freeze-up and ice conditions expected this fall and winter, caution is advised when travelling on the land.  Here are some helpful tips to stay safe when out on the land: Tell family and friends where you are going and when you plan to be back.  Travel in a group and make sure someone at home knows who is with you. Prepare for changing weather conditions and bring an emergency survival kit. Check in regularly with home – if you can.

I want to reassure residents that the NWT Health and Social Services system has been closely monitoring the situation in Alberta in recent weeks and days.  “As of Monday, November 16, 2020 Alberta Health Services (AHS) has advised that some elective procedures may be delayed or cancelled. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) will continue to work with AHS and with patients to reschedule those procedures when circumstances allow. We are engaged and in close communication with our counterparts at AHS and they have assured us they will honour our longstanding agreement to provide services to NWT residents requiring care. “The agreement allows NWT residents to be considered equally to Alberta residents in terms of prioritization and access to services, and AHS has confirmed that this relationship will continue to be honored for services provided within their facilities as we move through the evolving pandemic situation. “The Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority (NTHSSA) has recently communicated to practitioners to carefully consider all non-urgent referrals to Alberta, and have provided guidance to ensure that in all cases where virtual care is possible, that it is the preferred method rather than sending residents in person to receive care.  “If NWT residents choose not to receive services in Alberta due to COVID-19 concerns they should contact their health care provider immediately. Additionally, residents who receive any pushback from health providers in Alberta should contact their local health care provider immediately so they can help rectify the situation.  “The NWT Health and Social Services system will continue to monitor the Alberta response closely. Should the situation change, the NTHSSA will contact impacted patients directly and provide updates online for the public at www.nthssa.ca.”"

As the new Minister of Health and Social Services I’ve got leadership responsibility for the well-being of all residents of the NWT. There are many issues that keep me awake and most recently, it has been how to keep the vulnerable population safe from the cold as winter approaches. COVID-19 has changed the capacity of shelters as it has restaurants and movie theatres, to provide for physical distancing and other public health precautions. That leaves a bigger, unserved population at risk outdoors. Day Shelters are intended to be space for people to go during the day and are especially important when we start to get colder weather, as we are now. The number of residents that require access to this type of facility during the day exceeds the numbers currently permitted in the existing temporary day shelter. As many of you know, the GNWT has made several attempts to find a location that would accommodate the numbers required in one single location, or without requiring drastic measures like the one required today. Staff at the Department of Health and Social Services looked at 26 locations as alternative spots: government buildings, private buildings, tents and ATCO trailers. None have panned out because they were unavailable, unsuitable or owners were unwilling to house a day shelter on their property. As Minister Chinna said, the state of emergency announced today is an extraordinary step that our Government is taking to address this situation, and one that we are doing at the request of the City of Yellowknife, and with full support of Cabinet. I am pleased to see this decision be made, but I want to ensure that the public understands that this is not a permanent solution. It is intended to address the immediate needs and keep our residents safe, while we work on finding a long-term solution. Here’s the bottom line: The GNWT has a responsibility to protect the homeless and vulnerable population just as we do to protect all of us from being infected by COVID-19. The fact that many in the population that this announcement directly supports are in the grip of addiction doesn’t diminish their right to safety.  I’d like to thank Mayor Alty and the City of Yellowknife for partnering with the GNWT on this and to the many NWT residents who have supported GNWT endeavors on this matter. Thank you. "

Thank you for being here today. I would like to thank Minister Green, and Mayor Alty from the City of Yellowknife for also joining us. Today I am here to announce that I have made the decision to enact a State of Emergency for the City of Yellowknife, for the purpose of addressing the emergency faced by the homeless residents of Yellowknife, and the need to provide them with temporary shelter.  This is an extraordinary step that our Government is taking to address this situation, following discussions with the City of Yellowknife, and with full support of my Cabinet colleagues. The Government of the NWT has been looking at options to address the homeless situation in Yellowknife. This has now become much more urgent as the temperatures have begun to drop and the risk to the homeless is rapidly increasing. This has also been made more difficult as a result of the COVID emergency, and the need to make sure that any solutions that are considered support the Orders of the Chief Public Health Officer. The only way to do this is to create more space for the homeless, and today’s decision will take us in that direction. Under the State of Emergency, the GNWT will acquire the Mine Safety Building from the City of Yellowknife, and we will begin to make the necessary alterations to establish this facility safely. The Government of the Northwest Territories has not made this decision lightly. We were hopeful that the GNWTs application for the use of a facility located on 44th Street would have led to a solution, but timing has now become a significant concern, and this offers an immediate solution. Accordingly, we are making the decision to act, and move forward with the best interests of the homeless residents in mind. While this is an extraordinary situation, I would like to confirm that this is being viewed as a temporary solution. The Government of the Northwest Territories has recently confirmed plans to establish a permanent Yellowknife day shelter in 2023. Once again, I would like to thank Mayor Alty, and the City of Yellowknife for working with us on this solution.  We need to continue to work together to support and help our people during this very difficult time. Thank you."

The Northwest Territories consistently records among the highest rates of violence against women in Canada, as reported by Statistics Canada. Two women have been murdered in the last two months. This violence is as heartbreaking as it is unacceptable. As a Territory, we need to do better. This month is Family Violence Prevention Month in the Northwest Territories. Let us take time to focus on promoting a change in attitudes and behaviours about violence against women and the harm that comes with it. The government is dedicated to providing the necessary resources to reduce the incidence of family violence in the territory and better support those who have experienced this type of trauma. We know that family violence can have lifelong impact on children and youth and influence how relationships are formed. It is critical that we do everything we can to stop this cycle and promote positive, healthy relationships. Madam Speaker, the response to family violence involves many GNWT departments and agencies taking a whole of government approach.  It also requires us to work closely with our community partners to ensure the solutions reflect the priorities of the communities.  We have established an Inter-Departmental Working Group that will review GNWT programs and services providing family violence supports. This team is working on an action plan on the Calls to Justice from the Final Report of the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls national inquiry. This work will contribute to addressing the issue of domestic violence, among other things.  We look forward to seeing the results of this work.  Family Violence Shelters are territorial resources that can be accessed 	24-hours a day. There are shelters in Tuktoyaktuk, Inuvik, Yellowknife, Hay River and Fort Smith. Even if there is not a shelter in your community, travel assistance is available to get to one.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not necessary to call 8-1-1 to get an exemption to the public health orders to be in a shelter with non-family members. Call the family crisis line directly at 	1-866-223-775. Staff will help you to make a safety plan, if required, and apply for an emergency protection order to keep the abuser away. Shelters also provide a range of support programs for women and children who are trying to leave an abusive relationship.  Shelter supports include, supportive counselling, case management and referral, support in identifying housing and income supports, links to transitional housing supports and most importantly a safe place to stay. For the five communities with shelters, the GNWT provides $3.5 million annually in core funding. In addition to this core funding, we appreciate the support of the federal government, which in August announced one time only funding of $321 thousand in COVID funding to support the shelters.  Madam Speaker, we believe that the incidence of intimate partner family violence is likely escalating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Families may be stressed by the challenges they face and self-isolation may make things worse.  In the early stages of the pandemic, very few women were seeking admission to the family violence shelters.  However, at the same time, the number of emergency protection orders increased. Although these trends are disturbing, as a government, we have implemented a number of measures to help intervene at this difficult time. We have communicated to residents that NWT family violence shelters remain open and available during the pandemic.  We have distributed over 150 cell phones to victim service providers to distribute to those in need.  This ensures there is a safe way for women to seek information and support. The NWT Help Line, community counselling services, and Child and Youth Care Counsellors remain ready to help.  We are continuing to monitor this situation closely and encourage anyone who needs help to reach out to one of these supports. Madam Speaker, as a territory we cannot afford to view family violence as a special awareness week or a one-time initiative. The health and wellbeing of our residents depends on a coordinated approach to breaking the silence and working together in meaningful ways to end all forms of family violence.   Thank you, Madam Speaker."

This funding has been provided by the Government of Canada through the Department of Canadian Heritage’s Emergency Support Fund for Cultural, Heritage and Sport Organizations.   The funding provides additional temporary relief to support sport organizations and helps them plan for the future.  This funding is being used to support the continuation of sport and recreation program operations across the Northwest Territories.  The funds will enable them to support the healthy lifestyle goals outlined in the Government of the Northwest Territories’ Emerging Wisely plan to manage the impacts of the pandemic. Municipal and Community Affairs distributed funding for sport and recreation programs in the amounts of: $721,289 to 33 community governments; $634,000 to 29 territorial sport organizations; and  $228,351 to territorial and regional sport and recreation non-government organizations. Madam Speaker, the innovative projects being supported through this funding are impressive, they include: Outdoor events such as winter cultural day camps with fishing, trapping and traditional Indigenous games; Upgrades and repairs to outdoor sport and recreation areas like parks as well as 		ski and hiking trails; The doubling of some program offerings so that everyone interested can participate even when attendance restrictions limit the number of people at any single event; Cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment for staff; On-line programming; and Extra staff and additional cleaning costs. Community governments have also been reaching out to schools to support student and resident access to services so that health and wellness can be bolstered in these challenging times. Madam Speaker, MACA continues to support community governments and sport and recreation organizations dealing with the impacts of the pandemic by extending resources from all existing programs.  Communities have demonstrated the flexibility to adapt programs to deal with restrictions under the public health order.  Madam Speaker, the Government of Canada’s support for NWT sport programming could not have come at a better time.  Through innovative planning and careful health and safety measures, this funding will be supporting important sport and recreation programs that directly impact the physical and mental health of all NWT residents. Thank you, Madam Speaker. "

The Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission acted swiftly to put in place financial relief measures for employers who were unable to make their assessment payments. These measures extended the deadline for the first installment of 2020 assessment payments to August 1st and gave valuable time to employers to adjust their payroll estimates and to make their payments later in the year without facing any late payment penalties. Madam Speaker, many businesses that have remained open or have successfully reopened during the pandemic are continuing to do so safely with the support of the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer working in partnership with the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission.   As part of the Emerging Wisely Plan, employers must complete an exposure control plan for how they will identify and manage the risk of COVID-19. An exposure control plan is also a requirement under the Northwest Territories Safety Act and Northwest Territories Occupational Health & Safety Regulations. Employers are responsible for ensuring a healthy and safe workplace. That responsibility has not changed. Employers do not need to send their exposure control plans to the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission for approval, however, Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission Occupational Health and Safety Inspectors will only request a copy of the completed plan from employers when they are responding directly to concerns or doing an inspection. To date Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission staff has provided direct assistance to over 2,500 employers through outreach and inspections to help them to develop their pandemic exposure control plans and to put practical solutions in place. Many employers and industry organizations have proactively reached out to the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission for this assistance, showing the commitment that employers here in the Northwest Territories have to keeping their staff and their customers safe.  As other parts of Canada see their COVID-19 case numbers rising, Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission remains committed to supporting local businesses to review their plans regularly, to make sure they are prepared and to continue to provide support as needed to protect the health and safety of workers, clients and customers. There are a number of great resources available on the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission website. I strongly encourage any business that has concerns about how to do a good risk assessment or put a plan in place to look there for guidance or to get in touch with the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission.  Finally, Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize the contributions of three outgoing members of the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission Governance Council - 	Mr. David Tucker, Mr. Abe Thiel and Mr. Jack Rowe.  I would like to thank the members for their service and important work overseeing the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission and representing the interests of workers, employers and the general public. Thank you, Madam Speaker."

This document represents this government’s next steps forward in addressing the systemic causes of violence directed at Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people.   The 231 Calls for Justice are far-reaching and complex; developing a response is not a simply a matter of reviewing and signing off on work already being done.  This process will take a careful and thorough review of what we are currently doing, realistically and honestly assessing the effectiveness of what we are doing now, what we need to do in the future, and setting targets to measure progress moving forward. The work plan also asks GNWT departments to review and analyze how well our current programs, services and policies reflect the spirit and intent of the Calls for Justice and what could be done to address the inequities identified in the Calls for Justice. Madam Speaker, this government is already doing a lot to address these Calls for Justice.  We have partnerships and bilateral agreements in place with a number of Indigenous governments.  We have, and continue to, collaborate with Indigenous and community organizations in providing programs and services that respond to the needs of NWT residents.  Indigenous languages, traditional knowledge and respect and valuing of culture are already incorporated into many of our programs and services and are an integral part of how we do business. As a government, we pride ourselves on our ability to work with community partners.    The Calls for Justice also direct that Indigenous governments, community governments, territorial NGOs, local organizations and people with lived experience be engaged and given an opportunity to help shape how governments respond to the Calls for Justice.  The draft work plan I am tabling later today, includes engagement in the NWT as we prepare our response to the Calls for Justice.  There is a lot for the Government of the Northwest Territories to absorb and consider in responding to the Final Report, and we are committed to thoughtfully considering and responding to each of the Calls for Justice.  However, we also recognize that some of the Calls for Justice may take longer to implement than others.  For example, there are calls to establish new legislation or revise existing legislation, and this takes time.  However, this does not mean we will forget about this important work or put it on the back burner.  When preparing the GNWT Action Plan, we also have to be mindful that the Government of Canada is working on the development of a National Action Plan in response to the Calls for Justice.  Territorial officials will continue to collaborate at the federal, provincial and territorial level to ensure the Northwest Territories has a voice nationally. The draft work plan is a living document that will be reviewed regularly to measure progress and to make any changes necessary to address the evolving nature of this work. I want to assure the Members there will continue to be opportunities to provide input throughout the process. Survivors and families of missing and murdered Indigenous women in the NWT deserve our respect and our help. We are working with departments to develop and implement a timely and comprehensive response so that we support them in their healing journey. I want to note that the Government of Canada has created a support line available for anyone affected by missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls who needs immediate emotional assistance. The support line can be reached at 1-844-413-6649. Madam Speaker, the GNWT welcomed the recommendations of the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.  We are focused on, and committed to, improving the safety and well-being of Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people, now and in the future.  Mahsi, Madam Speaker."

From highways to airports to buildings, I would like to provide an update today on the significant progress our government has made to improve public infrastructure across the territory.  Our government has improved over 200 kilometres of highway this year. We have completed 105 kilometres of new chipseal surface on Highway No. 1, and reconstructed the Inuvik Airport Access Road. Residents can expect a smoother and safer driving experience. These improvements were made possible by funding from the Government of Canada’s New Building Canada Plan. I thank our federal colleagues for their continued collaboration and support. In addition to improving the existing highway system, over 85 kilometres of embankment has been constructed for the new all-season road to Whatì, which is scheduled to open next fall. This project is now more than 70 per cent complete; a great accomplishment, particularly during this COVID-19 pandemic. Madam Speaker, airports are an essential part of our transportation system. Communities across the North depend on air travel for the movement of goods and people, air ambulances, search and rescue, forest fire response, and much more. Airports also play a role in supporting economic opportunities.  This fiscal year, over 16 million dollars was invested to enhance operations and services at 13 of our airports, including drainage and runway improvements and the replacement of older equipment. Three major capital projects are in the works at the Inuvik Mike Zubko Airport. A new air terminal building is planned to open in 2023. At the same time, improvements will be made to the airfield drainage, which will increase the resiliency of the airport to the effects of climate change. The design of a 3,000-foot runway extension is moving ahead as planned, on behalf of the Department of National Defence. Madam Speaker, we will continue to invest in our public buildings. Several major projects are underway across the territory, including a multi-year project to replace the École J.H. Sissons School in Yellowknife. Our department is working with the Department of Education, Culture, and Employment on this project, which will result in a larger, more modern and accessible facility for students.  In Tuktoyaktuk, another school project is underway. Our government is in the process of renovating and expanding the Mangilaluk School. The project will increase the school’s capacity, improve site access, upgrade aging buildings systems, and will include a community library space and a new gymnasium. A tender to complete the tenant improvements at the Stanton Legacy Building is scheduled to close on November 6, 2020 with an estimated completion schedule of spring 2022. Madam Speaker, infrastructure projects will continue to play an important role in the economic recovery of the Northwest Territories post-COVID-19. These projects provide business and employment opportunities for our residents, boosting the economy while delivering the critical infrastructure that this territory needs to provide key programs and services to our residents.

380,2020-11-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-compliance-and-enforcement-activities-northwest-territories-public-land,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Compliance and Enforcement Activities on Northwest Territories Public Land,"Check against delivery   Madam Speaker, land is the foundation of the Northwest Territories, both figuratively and literally. Our government is responsible for managing 1.15 million square kilometres of it. Setting and enforcing clear rules and regulations for how public land is used is a critical part of ensuring that the Northwest Territories’ land and resources are well-managed. Clear, well communicated rules help the Government of the Northwest Territories make sure that everybody understands what can and cannot be done on public land. They also give the government a fair and consistent basis for taking action against anybody who breaks them.  The Department of Lands uses a number of pieces of territorial and federal legislation to help clearly and fairly set and enforce rules on land use. These pieces are further underpinned by the Ministerial Policy on Compliance and Enforcement.  The primary goal of compliance and enforcement under this policy is to deter, minimize and remedy non-compliance. The Ministerial Policy on Compliance and Enforcement also establishes that enforcement action should be timely and proportionate to the severity of the non-compliance and consider the actual or potential impact on the land and natural resources.  Actions to manage use of Northwest Territories public land and resources under this policy include informing and educating the public about the rules and requirements and providing support and advice on how to comply with the rules.  The policy provides a fair and consistent approach to monitor compliance.  It is focused on education and building awareness. In short, helping to prevent non-compliance wherever possible, and resolving any non-compliance before it impacts the land or natural resources.  Where non-compliance cannot be resolved, the policy sets out a consistent approach that seeks remedies to fix any harm caused by non-compliance, or to imposes sanctions, including laying charges under relevant legislation.  Consistent with this approach, the Department regards unauthorized occupancy as one of the more severe instances of non-compliance. Members of the public can report potential incidents of unauthorized occupancy by calling their local Lands Regional office.  Contact information is available on the department’s website. The Government of the Northwest Territories recognizes that land and resources are of significant importance to Indigenous governments and organizations. Since 2018 the Department of Lands has supported interested regional Indigenous governments and organizations to identify and document cabins that support traditional uses of the land.    As part of our ongoing enforcement efforts the Department will continue to post notices on untenured structures.  This first notice is an opportunity for the occupant to come forward and identify or clarify any legal basis for their occupation.  As the Department moves this work forward, we are also working with Indigenous governments and organizations to ensure there is a clear process for when a cabin that is associated with an Aboriginal rights assertion is posted.   The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to the responsible management and use of the Northwest Territories’ land, resources and environment. To this end, the Department will be bringing the Public Land Act into force that applies to all public land in the Northwest Territories and brings clarity to all land users. Madam Speaker, we are all stewards of the land. We all know our responsibilities. We want to ensure the people of the Northwest Territories know that the Department of Lands is continuing to take action by supporting a clear, consistent and enforced land management regime. Thank you, Madam Speaker."
381,2020-11-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-indigenous-representation-public-service-0,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Indigenous Representation in the Public Service ,"Check against delivery   Madam Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to maintaining a professional and representative public service. Increasing Indigenous representation within our public service has long been a goal of the Legislative Assembly.  The first and most visible tool used by the GNWT to support this goal is the Affirmative Action Policy. This policy and its implementation are often criticized as being ineffective because the percentage of Indigenous Aboriginal employees in the GNWT has remained at around 30% for the last several decades.  Madam Speaker, the Affirmative Action Policy alone cannot address the root causes that contribute to this lack of growth in Indigenous representation among public servants. We acknowledge that this is a complex issue that will not be solved by a one-size-fits-all approach. Challenges to improved Indigenous representation exist at every stage of a public servant’s career path, including hiring, retention, promotion and succession planning.  Over the years, the GNWT has implemented several programs with the intent of increasing Indigenous representation within the GNWT. The Indigenous Career Gateway Program, the Regional Recruitment Program, the Internship Program, and the Summer Student Employment Program each take a different approach to bringing Indigenous residents into the public service. Cultural awareness training supports an inclusive workplace culture and the Indigenous Management Development and Training Program helps Indigenous employees access funds for professional development. Each program has its own benefits, however; there is always room for improvement to ensure these programs are used to their full capacity and are as effective as possible. In response to call for action No. 57 from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Department of Finance, in collaboration with Education, Culture and Employment, and Health and Social Services is redeveloping the Cultural Awareness and Sensitivity Training for public service employees. The goals of this training include: the creation of awareness and understanding of the impact of colonization; to have all GNWT employees recognize our collective roles in reconciliation; and to provide all employees with the necessary foundation and tools to be culturally competent.  With the knowledge acquired by participating in this new training, managers and employees will be supported to reflect on ways they can address the root causes of systemic discrimination within their workplaces, personal circumstances and communities. This training will be mandatory for all GNWT employees and will be released in the winter of 2021. We recognize the benefit this training can have within our communities and believe it will help our government set an example for the rest of Canada. As such, this training will be available to not only GNWT public servants but to the public as well.  Madam Speaker, we recognize that these programs are just the first steps on a long road towards addressing the imbalance in Indigenous representation in the GNWT. There is still much work to do. In addition, the Department of Finance is currently developing an Indigenous Recruitment and Retention Framework that will include departmental Indigenous employment implementation plans with distinct targets. This Framework will begin with a look at best practices from other jurisdictions, the development of an Indigenous Labour Force Analysis of the Northwest Territories and a thorough review of current programs, tools, and resources. We will incorporate feedback received through engagement with Indigenous Governments and internal partners, and will ultimately assist each department in reviewing their recruitment and retention to ensure barriers to employment for Indigenous peoples are identified and addressed across the whole of the GNWT.  Madam Speaker, our people are our territory’s greatest resource. Investing in the skills and qualifications of Northerners provides employment for our people and benefits all residents and our economy. Through this important work we will begin to identify, address and dismantle the systemic barriers that have prevented the actualization of a representative public service.   Thank you, Madam Speaker."

Simpson: Training, Skills Development and Partnerships across the Northwest Territories","Check against delivery   Madam Speaker, increasing employment in small communities is an important mandate of our government. This week across Canada, National Skilled Trades and Technology Week will be celebrated as we raise awareness of the many career opportunities in the skilled trades and technology sectors in the Northwest Territories and across Canada. This week, we also honour the 31 Apprenticeship High Mark award recipients and the 36 individuals who have obtained journeyperson certification this year in the Northwest Territories. I want to offer my warm congratulations to all the award recipients on their achievements. The Department of Education, Culture, and Employment supports the development of a skilled Northern workforce on many levels, including through the delivery of designated trades and occupation certification programs. This year, Madam Speaker, I am pleased to advise you that we have five new members on the Apprenticeship, Trades and Occupation Certification Board to provide advice and link between the department and industry to lead, and are finalizing a promotional campaign to reach out to apprentices and inform them of the many opportunities they can access in our territory. We are also working towards issuing a Blue Seal qualification, which will assist journeypersons in a designated trade or occupation to have their business skills recognized. To further support the Apprenticeship program, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment is also moving forward with the Women in Trades Program and Journeyperson Mentorship Program, both of which will be implemented in 2021. Madam Speaker, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment works in collaboration with many partners to seek out and develop opportunities for residents and organizations in small communities. We have established Regional Training Committees to collaborate on joint training and employment initiatives. These typically include regional Indigenous organizations and economic and labour market stakeholders, as well as the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment, and Aurora College. There are currently three dynamic Committees in the South Slave, Dehcho and Beaufort Delta, and we are working to establish Training Committees in any other regions that express interest.  Madam Speaker, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment actively seeks out opportunities with communities, businesses, and government departments and agencies to offer increased opportunities to NWT residents. One of our key partnerships is with the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation, through which we are seeking to maximize the use of journeypersons in Local Housing Organizations to target training opportunities for apprentices. Currently, there are more than 30 journeypersons working in communities.   One of the programs we offer is the Small Community Employment Support Program, providing designated community authorities access to annual funding to help address local labour market needs and priorities. From 2018 to April 2020, more than 1,400 jobs have been supported in small communities by this program.  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to advise you and this House that to support small communities in addressing the impacts of the pandemic until 2022, designated community authorities can use their funding under the Small Community Employment Support program to hire local residents to assist in addressing any pandemic-related challenge or need. Madam Speaker, I have some additional good news in relation to our partnership with the Government of Canada. We are currently working with the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada to secure new funding to support economic and labour market recovery in the North. I will have more information to provide my colleagues and the public in the near future once more details become available.  Madam Speaker, over the past number of years the department’s approach to supporting the labour market and training opportunities in communities across the Northwest Territories has been strategic and collaborative. When the pandemic hit, we mobilized and responded quickly to ensure clients, employers, organizations and community projects were not penalized or impacted financially as a result of changes in the delivery of education or training programs. Training, skills development and education are crucial to the Northwest Territories’ economic recovery, and our partners and ourselves have demonstrated we are ready to respond quickly with innovation, consideration and collaboration.

This priority reflects the importance of the mineral resource sector to our economy both today and into the foreseeable future.   Our efforts to support the mineral resource sector are further reflected in our commitments to develop regulations for the new Mineral Resource Act; to develop and implement regional mineral development strategies and review our Mining Incentive Program, Socio-Economic Agreements and our territory’s fiscal regime around mining.  Later today, I will table the annual Socio-Economic Agreement Report for Mines Operating in the NWT.  It will outline and confirm again the benefits of mining to our territory. With a total impact of 27 percent of GDP, diamond mining was the largest private sector industry in the NWT and the primary foundation of our economy in 2019.    Our diamond mines employed 1,334 NWT residents last year more than half of them Indigenous.  Over and above the direct benefit of wages, skills training and capacity building, the NWT mining industry contributed $1.1 billion to related sectors like construction, transportation, retail, and real estate.  The GNWT also realized revenue from the mining industry in the form of corporate income tax, fuel tax, property tax, payroll tax, and personal income tax.  In total, $370 million was spent with Indigenous companies in our territory. Royalties to Indigenous governments totaled over $3 million in the 2018-2019 fiscal year in addition to benefits paid out in under Impact Benefit Agreements signed directly with Indigenous governments. Madam Speaker, big companies can also make big differences in the communities that they are part of. From scholarships to donations to sponsorships, their contributions to our communities are evident well beyond their mine sites.  Even through this COVID pandemic, where profits are often non-existent, Madam Speaker the diamond mines have continued to be strong corporate citizens. I want to acknowledge, that our support of the mineral resource sector comes within the context of a regulatory regime that works to ensure that resource development occurs in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. We are confident that our system strives to achieve a balance between economic opportunity and the protection of our environment. We will keep that balance as we continue the work of developing a truly northern centered and modern regulatory system. In recent weeks, we have had to consider the very real possibility that the Ekati Diamond Mine will continue in a state of care and maintenance for an extended period of time.  Madam Speaker, we want the Ekati Mine to return to full operations. It remains a valuable natural resource and recent events do not change that fact.  We also want to restore our mineral development sector, not just our mines but also advanced projects and exploration companies to a position of growth and prosperity.   These are trying times and a difficult road of economic recovery lies ahead. There are several things the GNWT will do to help us advance down that road:     Continue to recognize the value of mine workers to the territory, including the many benefits that flow through them into our communities; Highlight the competitiveness of our jurisdiction to investors; Complete the work required to implement the Mineral Resources Act, including developing new regulations; Develop and implement Regional Mineral Strategies;  Increase collaboration and investment with Indigenous governments; and Promote the NWT as a source of critical and strategic minerals and metals.  Madam Speaker, our government is committed to growing the NWT mining sector and accordingly its contributions to investment, employment, and Indigenous participation in the NWT’s economy. Thank you, Madam Speaker."

During the pandemic, it is crucial we normalize  wearing non-medical masks  so everyone feels safe and supported when using this important tool in the COVID-19 prevention toolbox.   The Public Health Agency of Canada states that when worn properly, a person wearing a non-medical mask or face covering can reduce the spread of his or her own infectious respiratory droplets. Studies suggest that transmission of a respiratory virus from person to person is significantly decreased if both are wearing non-medical masks.  The first phase the campaign, focused on social media advertising will show ordinary people wearing non-medical face masks with explanations about why it is the most important thing they are wearing. Posts will be made on Facebook and Twitter.   Quotes “Now more than ever we need to work together to protect each other. It was inevitable our territory would see more COVID-19 cases as Canada is facing record numbers of confirmed cases. By taking action as individuals, and as a territory, we can be prepared, and do our part to protect residents and communities. Wearing non-medical face masks is one of them.” - Caroline Cochrane, Premier   “COVID-19 has presented unprecedented challenges to jurisdictions across the globe, and we’ve all had to take actions and steps that we may not be used to. We’ve asked NWT residents throughout this pandemic to do  their part and be a leader, and we’re asking that of you again. Lead by example and wear your non-medical mask to help promote this tool to keep us all safe.” - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services   Quick facts ·       The first phase of the campaign will see social media advertising placed on Facebook and Twitter with several different image choices. After two weeks, the GNWT will assess which are the most popular. ·       From there, images will be chosen to be featured on window wraps to be placed on high-traffic grocery stores and posters to be sent to communities across the Northwest Territories.  ·       Radio ads, including placements in Indigenous languages, and newspaper advertisements with supportive messaging on masking will also be launched.    ·       Non-medical masks are recommended when you cannot consistently maintain a physical distance of two metres from others. Examples of when to wear a non-medical mask include: o   Stores and other shopping areas o   Line-ups and waiting areas o   Public transportation o   Public events (i.e. craft sales) ·       The wearing of non-medical masks does not replace other safety measures and should be done while also undertaking the following: o   Frequent cleaning of surfaces o   Washing hands frequently with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds; o   Staying home when sick; and o   Maintaining a six feet, or 2-metres, of physical distance from others.   Related links ·       Learn how to make a cloth face mask ·       How to put on and remove a face mask ·       How to put on and take off a mask and eye protection Non-medical masks, PPE and cleaning supplies manufacturers and suppliers in the NWT   For media requests, please contact:  Mike Westwick Manager, Communications (COVID-19 Response) Department of Health and Social Services Government of the Northwest Territories  Telephone 867-767-9488 ext. 61115 Cell 867-688-0958"

390,2020-11-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-water-treatment-plant-upgrades,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Water Treatment Plant Upgrades,"Check against delivery    Mr. Speaker, in the spring of 1999, a small community in southern Ontario called Walkerton made national news because of the deaths and sickness that were linked to contamination in the municipality’s drinking water supply.  This incident served as a wake-up call for municipalities and governments across Canada to take stock of the state of drinking water supplies in communities across the nation. Here, in the Northwest Territories, three levels of government including, the Government of Canada, the Government of the Northwest Territories and Community Governments are jointly responsible for ensuring that drinking water is safe for human consumption.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to update the Members on the efforts to upgrade NWT Water Treatment Plants to meet the requirements of the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality. The GNWT formed an inter-departmental committee called the NWT Drinking Water Committee. This committee focuses on water-related issues and provides a forum for communication, cooperation, consultation and information exchange, as well as to provide a link to other governmental and non-governmental agencies with interests in drinking water.  The committee set a goal early on to see each community with a modern water treatment plant that would meet the guidelines for canadian drinking water quality. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to announce that as of October 5, 2020, this goal has been achieved when Wekweètì’s new water plant was approved for use.  All communities in the NWT that operate a water treatment plant are now capable of meeting the filtration requirements of the national guidelines.  Since 2001, partnerships between the federal government, GNWT and community governments have resulted in 23 upgraded water treatment systems.   16 communities have constructed new modern water treatment plants and, an additional seven have gone through mid-life retrofits or upgrades to meet the standards.  Community governments have been successfully utilizing federal infrastructure programs over the years, such as the Build Canada Plan, Small Communities Fund, Clean Water and Wastewater Fund and Gas Tax Agreement, to supplement their Community Public Infrastructure Funding from the GNWT to build these water treatment plants. Mr. Speaker, success can also be seen in community governments’ investment in their staff. All 30 NWT water plants are now operated by local residents, 23 of the plants have certified local operators. MACA is actively working with the remaining seven to upgrade the certification of their operators and provide more oversight and support while these operators are training.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the accomplishments we have made to date and all NWT residents can be confident that their drinking water is safe. Our work is not done. MACA continues to work with community governments to assess their systems, plan for upgrades, and continues to support operators with ongoing training.   Our interdepartmental team will continue to support our communities. The GNWT is committed to providing a coordinated approach that supports water systems including intake, treatment, and distribution. We will continue to ensure safe drinking water for all NWT residents is a priority.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
391,2020-11-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-procurement-review,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Procurement Review,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, one of our government’s guiding principles is to ensure that the expenditure of public funds maximizes economic benefits to Northerners and supports Northern business. This is consistent with our longstanding commitment to support Northwest Territories businesses and grow a strong, diversified economy.  We put that commitment into practice through the Business Incentive and NWT Manufactured Products policies, which help ensure government purchases are made from, or through, NWT-owned businesses wherever possible and to leverage this investment back into our economy.  Similarly, our Negotiated Contracts Policy exists to increase the capacity of northern and Indigenous-owned businesses, supporting them to be more competitive in the northern business environment.  We have committed in our mandate to work with NWT businesses to strengthen GNWT procurement policies and practices.  By the end of November, we will formally begin this important conversation.  Mr. Speaker, reaching consensus on the subject of preferential procurement is going to require that we work together, be open minded, flexible and adopt a whole-of-government and territory-wide mindset.   Leaders from across levels of government and from businesses will be asked for their input on where and how to strike a balance between supporting Indigenous and NWT businesses and widely accepted principles of responsible public procurement, including transparency, fairness and realizing competitive value for public dollars spent. There are many difficult and contentious questions to face. For example, under what circumstances should the GNWT pay more for goods and services if they are provided by a northern business? How much more and how do we define an NWT business? Should the objective of our policies be to level the playing field between NWT businesses and those in other jurisdictions?  Is it to attract jobs and investment to the NWT? Is it to help minimize the cost of living in our territory? Mr. Speaker, likely the answer will be “yes” to more than one question so the challenge will be finding a way to balance these sometimes competing objectives.   What should an Indigenous procurement policy look like? How do we achieve a measured level of participation and benefit to NWT Indigenous governments and businesses? Through interviews, written submissions, targeted engagement opportunities and online surveys, we will give every opportunity for NWT leaders, Indigenous governments, business interests and communities to share their perspectives and ideas on how to answer these many questions and help advance the collective interests of our territory. Mr. Speaker, our mandate states that government procurement and contracting is a source of economic activity throughout the NWT, and residents and businesses should benefit as much as possible.  At the end of the day we want more NWT residents working and advancing their careers and more businesses thriving and growing in our territory. It is time to revisit the policies we have to support these goals and face these sometimes complex and competing questions. While the GNWT mandate commits to the completion of this review in 2022, I have asked the Departments of Industry, Tourism and Investment and Finance to do their best to have this review completed by the end of next summer. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
392,2020-11-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-continued-housing-and-homelessness-response-covid-19,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Continued Housing and Homelessness Response to COVID-19,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, supporting vulnerable residents in need of housing or facing homelessness continues to be an essential part of the Government of the Northwest Territories’ response to COVID-19. The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation is working diligently to meet the needs of our residents as we move through the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to physically distance remains with us and continues to significantly impact our interactions with each other and has highlighted the need for us all to work together, think innovatively, and simply be kind to others. Mr. Speaker, as the pandemic unfolded last spring, the housing corporation enhanced its Transitional Rent Supplement program by streamlining the process and simplifying participant requirements. Prior to the pandemic, this program served approximately 	40 participants. Now that number has expanded up to close to 150 households. This program has now been extended through November to continue to support our residents. We recognize that the impacts of COVID-19 have been felt across our territory and country. Among the many unfortunate realities of the pandemic is that a sudden loss of income could lead some individuals to being at risk of experiencing homelessness. In light of this reality, we increased the budget for the homelessness assistance fund from $125,000 to $300,000. This program supports people with financial assistance to find private rental market housing. We understand that the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19 can be extremely stressful and we are working to ensure that applications are processed as quickly as possible.  Mr. Speaker, the GNWT remains committed to ensuring that our residents are able to access appropriate housing and shelter to self-isolate effectively, as needed. The GNWT has committed five million to help our most vulnerable residents be able to effectively 	self-isolate, this includes $1.4 million to support the self-isolation needs of individuals at risk of or currently experiencing homelessness. The funding also included $3.6 million to bring online 108 units that were mostly in need of renovations in order to meet core housing needs.  At present, these units are not required by the Emergency Management Organization, they are in the process of being re-allocated by the Housing Corporation to rental programs, such as public housing, market rental, affordable rental, or to support homeownership. 	At this time, 36 of these newly renovated units have been allocated and are serving as safe, affordable, and appropriate homes for NWT residents. As more units continue to be 	re-allocated we expect to see a decrease in waiting lists in many communities, which should help in preparation for a second wave of COVID-19. Mr. Speaker, we must continue to work with our community partners to access buildings to serve as self-isolation centres for our most vulnerable residents, as necessary. 	In Yellowknife we have leased the Aspen Apartment complex from the Government of Canada in order to provide 32 units for vulnerable residents to self-isolate. Also in Yellowknife, we have supported Spruce Bough, the former Arnica Inn, which provides up to 40 supportive housing units and have assisted the Salvation Army to utilize more of its space. In Hay River, along with the Hay River committee for persons with disabilities, we opened a new emergency overnight shelter and in Inuvik we had procured Aurora College student housing over the summer months to provide temporary housing. As the NWT begins to recover from COVID-19 the Housing Corporation will be an important economic contributor to economic recovery.  We will be working with communities all across the NWT to ensure the construction, renovation, and repair work are done in a safe and considerate manner that provides the greatest benefit to the local communities and their residents. Mr. Speaker, many residents across the NWT that are homeless or at risk of being homeless require housing stability and person-centred support. We know that addressing housing stability is critical to the success and overall well-being of our residents and is an issue that this government takes seriously. As we move into the anticipated second wave, we need to remember to look after one another, provide supports and continue to listen to the advice from our public health officials, keeping all of us safe throughout this pandemic.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
393,2020-11-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-benefits-covid-19-coordinating-secretariat,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Benefits of the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, as COVID-19 approached at the beginning of this year, our government was preparing our institutions to respond to the threat of a generation.  Before a case ever reached our borders, we pulled together a team from across our public service to stand up our emergency response. As the threat grew, so too did our response.   We declared a public health emergency; we restricted travel; we required self-isolation planning; and we put restrictions on businesses and people as the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed in our territory.  We step up contact centres like ProtectNWT and 8-1-1 to process more than 21,000 self-isolation plans and get people the information they needed; placed border staff at airports and highways and enforcement officers across our regions; and we established safe spaces for isolation in communities with enhanced medical care.  Mr. Speaker, our initial measures paid off. We were able to keep this virus under control and bring stability to our territory. Achieving this stability means we are able to keep looking forward, even as many across the country look at tightening up.  Now that we know more about COVID-19 and it’s affects on the Northwest Territories we can build a stronger response that better serves communities, residents, and businesses.  Mr. Speaker, this is what the COVID Coordinating Secretariat will do.   It will bring together the pandemic services thousands of residents have counted on since March under one roof, and bring in the leadership and investment required to allow us to better prepare for the second wave. We know the majority of residents, businesses, and communities want these services and they want them to work well.  The dedicated team at the COVID Coordinating Secretariat will be able to deliver more seamless services for residents and businesses.  Mr. Speaker, these services are necessary. COVID-19 is not going away any time soon. We need these services to continue to operate, so departments can better focus on their normal daily functions and the priorities of this Legislative Assembly.  Rising to a challenge like this pandemic means making real investments. Every jurisdiction across the world has done it. Our territory is no different.  We know that these investments in isolation requirements, border controls and enforcement work, not just from our own experience, but from the experiences of fellow successful jurisdictions like Nunavut, Atlantic Canada, and Yukon; who are all investing in similar services to keep their jurisdictions safe.  But Mr. Speaker, we also must balance the need for these services with fiscal responsibility, and bringing the delivery of our pandemic response under one structure will make controlling costs easier.  The work to find savings has already begun. We are currently reviewing the territory’s approach to isolation costs, and considering equitable and fair ways to reduce the financial burden that makes up over half of the costs of our pandemic services. Mr. Speaker, Indigenous governments and communities continue to play an important role in our efforts to protect the health and safety of residents. We will continue to engage with Indigenous governments, and community leadership, as well as business stakeholders, as we consider important changes to self-isolation requirements and other Secretariat functions. We know isolation in designated hubs has been tough on people. We have heard of the mental and social harms and we are in a better position to resolve them. Now more than ever, we need to be talking about our mental health and well-being. If you know someone who is having a difficult time, reach out. If you are struggling, please reach out for help. You are not alone. Mr. Speaker, with strong, territory-wide pandemic response plans, we have built the resilience and capacity we need to respond to cases across our communities.  With expanded rapid testing capacity, enhanced surveillance of wastewater, and improved contact tracing, we are able to consider new ways to mitigate risk for communities, while allowing people to return home sooner.  Mr. Speaker, what this Secretariat will not do is take away from our territory’s investments in our health system.  It will instead support these efforts, and the work of Chief Public Health Officer, 	 by taking on pandemic services which in the past had divided the attention of health officials as everyone worked to rise to the early challenges of COVID-19.  Investments like those in new testing devices, wastewater surveillance, nurses and laboratory expertise, and strong pandemic planning will continue, and our government will continue to get our health system the resources to respond to mental health and medical needs for all of our residents as we move forward.  Mr. Speaker, recently it was announced we have several active cases; the first cases the NWT has seen since the Spring.  With the arrival of a second wave in Canada, we must do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19 now more than ever. That includes treating individuals who test positive, either presumptive or confirmed, with respect, empathy and kindness. Even with taking every precaution people may still get COVID-19, and we need to be diligent in our own precautions and support our friends and neighbours. We must be ready, and stay ready.  The guidance, advice, and orders of public health leadership; the expertise on our frontlines; the operational support of the COVID Coordinating Secretariat and the work of each resident to abide by the Chief Public Health Officer recommendations will work together to keep residents as safe as possible.  So far the spread of COVID-19 has been managed. Not because we are lucky, but because we took action. We elected to invest in the health and safety of our territory, and the establishment of the Secretariat allows us to still focus on containing COVID-19 as well as committing to economic and social recovery, and to delivering on our mandate.  So when considering our way forward in this pandemic, I ask all Members to support our actions, because investing in health, safety, and stability is always the right choice.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

As the GNWT prepared for the inevitable arrival of COVID-19, the swift mobilization of its pandemic services limited the number of cases, and prevented loss-of-life.  Today, the territory is in a position to look forward while others are tightening up in part because of these measures.  Under certain conditions, nearly all businesses and organizations are now in operation, and the territory is forecast to recover to 90% of 2019 employment levels by the end of the year.  However, there remain significant challenges to certain industries, including tourism.  The Business Advisory Council and the COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat are working together to address remaining challenges, implement coordinated steps to weather the next peak of the pandemic, and pave the path towards recovery through the fall peak of COVID-19 in Canada.  With regular meetings and collaboration, both groups are working on creative solutions to support business and address gaps which will assist sectors of the economy which continue to struggle. The experience, talent, and resources of the NWT’s private sector will support and inform the GNWT’s decision-making as the government works to improve pandemic services to better serve residents and businesses, and continue to push back against the virus.  Both the GNWT and the Business Advisory Council agree the health and well-being of all communities and residents is best served by maintaining a stable economic environment.  This will be achieved with continued strong public health response, enhanced pandemic services delivered by the COVID Coordinating Secretariat, and the collective efforts of the private sector to adapt and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.    QUOTES: “The establishment of the COVID Secretariat has increased the ability for meaningful engagement with businesses. A coordinated response to the pandemic includes economic stability and we recognize the importance of both maintaining the financial viability of our businesses, and protecting the health of residents.”   – Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories   “As we continue to recover our economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will work with the Business Advisory Council to identify needed actions and investments.  By applying the invaluable experience and insight of the NWT’s private sector to our decision making, I’m confident that we can move forward and emerge from this crisis to revitalize, strengthen and grow our economy into the future.” -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment    “With the hard work that the GNWT, the business community and the residents of the NWT have put in over the last six months we are optimistic that the territory will not have to go back to the restrictions required during Phase I of Emerging Wisely.

Every five years, an independent auditor is appointed to conduct an Environmental Audit, as required under legislation and land claim agreements. The Audit is a way to assess how well the NWT environmental regulatory system is working and provide recommendations to help guide decision-makers, not just the GNWT.  The 2020 NWT Environmental Audit found the environmental regulatory system has continued to improve since the last Audit was completed in 2015. No new significant issues were identified, and progress was made in several areas, including climate change policy and action planning, and updated laws related to land, water and resource management. The Audit also highlighted areas that still need improvement, including community well-being, land use planning, finalizing land claims and engaging communities. The GNWT has responded to the 2020 NWT Environmental Audit and has committed to implementing its responses and continue building a stronger and more robust environmental regulatory system for the NWT.     Quote “We have a strong and effective environmental regulatory system in the NWT that relies on representatives from all levels of government contributing to Land and Water Board processes so they can make wise decisions about the use of our resources. I look forward to working with all parties responsible for decision-making to follow through on the recommendations to continue to improve the regulatory system.”  - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources     Quick facts ·       The 2020 NWT Environmental Audit is the second Audit commissioned by the GNWT following Devolution in 2014.  ·       The 2020 Audit makes 40 recommendations to governments and boards created by the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act and Waters Act. ·       Some recommendations of the Audit are already recognized as priorities by the GNWT, supported by the Mandate of the 19th Assembly. This includes settling and implementing treaty, land, resources and self-government agreements; increasing regional decision-making authority; strengthening the government’s leadership and authority on climate change and increasing employment in small communities.  ·       Key actions the GNWT is taking to address the recommendations of the Audit include:  o   Hosting a forum to discuss socio-economic issues with the mining industry and Indigenous governments and organizations o   Partnering with other organizations to expand water quality monitoring of lakes in the NWT o   Developing and implementing a cumulative effects framework o   Releasing water quality reporting guidelines   Related links Read the full 2020 NWT Environmental Audit Technical Report, plain language summary and fact sheet at https://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/en/services/nwt-environmental-audit     For media inquiries, please contact: Public Affairs and Communications Department of Environment and Natural Resources Government of the Northwest Territories  ENR_Communications@gov.nt.ca"
398,2020-10-30,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-government-renewal,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Government Renewal,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, in February during the delivery of the Budget Speech I said it was time to use creativity and innovation to find internal efficiencies. Since then, our government has had to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and in my last two fiscal updates since the onset of COVID-19, I have again said that now is the time to use creativity and use this moment of heightened awareness around our fiscal situation to consider how we want to emerge from the pandemic as a government and as a Territory. The Department of Finance’s mandate is to “obtain, manage and control the financial resources required to implement the Government of the Northwest Territories’ policies and programs”. Those responsibilities are not new; neither are our many fiscal challenges. We are going to use the current climate of recovery and renewal as an opportunity to reimagine how we obtain, manage and control those financial resources.  Mr. Speaker, over multiple Legislative Assemblies the data shows patterns of budgeting and spending that have impaired the long-term sustainability of the GNWT: our expenditures and the public service continue to grow; our planning is often reactive instead of proactive; and the significant capital investments which the territory absolutely needs have driven up our short-term debt. The COVID-19 pandemic has added to these fiscal pressures, and the GNWT needs a stable fiscal footing to support the territory’s recovery. We are far from alone in these challenges; other governments have similar challenges and, fortunately, new ways of budgeting government finances have emerged to respond.  The Department of Finance is planning to shift the way our budget is developed. The Government Renewal Initiative will rely on value-driven budgeting principles to review GNWT programs and services department by department and allocate resources to areas that are most critical and valuable to residents. Value-based budgeting, also known as priority-based budgeting, is both the idea that underlies the building of the budget as well as the method. It is founded on the common sense idea that government financial resources should be allocated based on how effectively programs and services give value to residents. This is a fundamental shift from how budgets are currently developed, where a large focus is on incremental increases and decreases from the year before. Using incremental budgeting, most of the budget is not actually subject to the same level of scrutiny as new spending and it can be difficult to respond to new or changing priorities. Incremental budgeting is more about where we have been; but now we want to shift to define our fiscal foundation by where we want to go.  Some of the key principles of this approach are to:  Provide better transparency to territorial priorities, and how services and programs contribute to those priorities; Prioritize and allocate budgets at the program and service level; More directly question past spending patterns; Evaluate the true cost and benefit of programs and services as part of budget development, rather than only looking at incremental changes; and Build more accountability for results into funding decisions. Mr. Speaker, this is a significant undertaking. Over the next few months, the Department of Finance will finalize the framework for how Government Renewal will be implemented early in the new year. We have already established the strategic priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly and are actively working on additional priority needs resulting from COVID-19 in our Emerge Stronger work. With those priorities in mind, we will undertake an evidence-based evaluation of where government resources are spent. For a budget development process that is based on the values of our residents to be meaningful engagement with my fellow Members of the Legislative Assembly is critical. The work will be difficult.  Defining and ranking often competing priorities is challenging.   But that is the work of governing. Applying the work of priority and value balancing to government budgeting is an opportunity to better reflect the diversity of the values and needs of all residents of the NWT. This is an opportunity to work together to ensure the government continues to have the resources required to deliver the programs and services that are important to the residents of the NWT. I stated in June and it holds true, “if ever we needed creative problem solving to achieve responsive and effective results, it is now.” I am confident that the Government Renewal Initiative will bring out this creative problem solving and help us maximize effectiveness, support the Territory’s pandemic recovery and build a sustainable foundation for the future of the NWT.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

This system is always evolving to serve the people of this territory better.  The Department of Environment and Natural Resources has a mandate to support the sustainable use of natural resources. Every five years, an independent auditor is appointed to conduct an Environmental Audit, as required under legislation and land claim agreements. The 2020 Northwest Territories Environmental Audit is the second audit commissioned by the Government of the Northwest Territories since Devolution. It was conducted by a team of independent consultants and guided by a steering committee of Indigenous, territorial and federal government representatives. The auditors focused on how environmental trends were used to make decisions, the effectiveness of cumulative impact monitoring, how the regulatory system is working, and the response to recommendations from the previous Audit.  The 2020 Audit found the environmental regulatory system in the Northwest Territories has continued to improve since the last Audit in 2015. There were no new significant issues identified in the 2020 Audit, and there was progress across most regulatory components.  Certain recommendations of the Audit were already recognized as priorities of this government, supported by the mandate priorities to settle and implement treaty, land, resources and self-government agreements and increase regional decision-making authority and employment in small communities. The Audit recognized the Government of the Northwest Territories for making progress on climate change policy and action planning, as well as working with Indigenous governments and organizations to make new laws and improve existing laws related to land, water and resource management since Devolution.  Mr. Speaker, while there has been progress over the last five years, there is still work to do. The Audit found there are improvements to be made in the areas of community well-being, land use planning, finalizing land claims and engaging communities. In total, the 2020 Environmental Audit provided 40 recommendations directed at decision-makers. All responses to those recommendations are included in the 2020 Audit Technical Report. The Government of the Northwest Territories has committed to implementing our responses to the Audit recommendations and continuing to improve our environmental management in the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, the 2020 Environmental Audit is an important tool the government and its partners can use to improve our resource management systems, while meeting our obligations under land claim agreements and Devolution. Later today, I will be tabling the Audit and look forward to working with all responsible parties over the next five years to follow through on the recommendations in the Audit.

The Fund helps support eligible organizations in their efforts to reduce poverty. The Anti-Poverty Advisory Committee, an external cross sector group, reviewed applications and made recommendations to the Minister for approval. This year, twenty eight grants  were awarded to community, Indigenous and non-profit organizations. To be considered for the Anti-Poverty fund, eligible organizations had to tie their project to one or more of the Territorial Anti-Poverty Strategy’s five pillars of child and family support; healthy living and reaching our potential; safe and affordable housing; sustainable communities; and integrated continuum of services. In addition, all proposals had to comply with the public health guidance in Emerging Wisely to ensure safety concerns associated with COVID-19. This year’s successful proposals aim to reduce poverty by supporting: food security; those experiencing homelessness; early childhood development; employment and training; healthy living; supporting Traditional Knowledge; and on-the-land activities. Highlights from the successful proposals include the Rapid Rehousing Program, run by the Yellowknife Women’s Society. This housing first program helps individuals experiencing homelessness to access and retain housing. The program provides targeted and time limited financial assistance and support services for those either at high risk of, or who are experiencing homelessness. Another highlight is the Food First Foundation which supports meal, cooking and gardening programs in schools across the NWT. Healthy food helps children to be attentive in school, increasing their ability to concentrate, learn, and develop into healthy adults. A third highlight is funding for the Tłįchǫ Łeagia Ts’įįlį Kǫ plans to establish a youth council that will develop a Behchokǫ̀ Youth Needs Assessment and Poverty Prevention Strategy to inform youth programming in the community.    Quote “Our priority is to ensure residents have access to supports they need so that they can live in dignity, are free from poverty, and are active members in their communities.

These foundational documents, along with input from our residents and partners, will help guide the transformation of Aurora College into a polytechnic university and beyond over the next six years.  Later today, I will table the Implementation Plan which identifies the critical milestones along the path towards the establishment of an effective and sustainable polytechnic university capable of supporting the aspirations of Northerners, diversifying the economy, and contributing to the long-term prosperity of the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, maintaining a high level of transparency and accountability is critical to the success of this project, which is why today we are launching a new Aurora College Transformation website. This website enables residents to learn about the transformation, follow the progress being made through various dashboards and tracking tools, and provide feedback.    Mr. Speaker, in August we sought feedback on a discussion paper about the areas of teaching and research specialization for the new polytechnic university. Feedback from Indigenous government partners, stakeholders from business, industry, post-secondary institutions, non-government organizations, and members of the public has informed these four initial areas of specialization, which are: Skilled trades and technology;  Earth resources and environmental management;  Northern health, education and community services; and  Business and leadership  These areas of specialization are not programs or classes, they are broad overarching themes that will provide the structure and focus required to maintain high quality programming and operations. Mr. Speaker, the polytechnic university will be focused on learners: meeting them where they are in their education journey and supporting them through a laddered approach as they work to achieve their own education and career goals. There will be a place for every NWT resident at the polytechnic university through access to adult basic education, upgrading, certificate, diploma and degree programs. It will give them improved and expanded access to quality post-secondary education opportunities close to home, as well as the confidence and experience to move on to additional degree and advanced degree programs.   None of this can be achieved without also increasing the availability of programming in our small communities. Through a new and innovative approach to community learning, the polytechnic university will have a clear and meaningful presence in every community of the NWT. From our smallest communities to our regional centres, new made-in-the-North programs and research initiatives will increase access to education and research opportunities through a network of learning centres, remote research facilities and campuses.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all those who have been supporting the work of transformation, including those who have taken the time to help shape the path forward through engagements. This transformation is one of the most promising ways we are preparing the Northwest Territories and our residents for future prosperity. As the institution emerges from transformation it will be stronger and more accessible, able to attract a greater number of students from within the NWT and beyond, and provide lasting economic benefits to the territory and our people.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
406,2020-10-29,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-anti-poverty,Government Website,Julie Green: Anti-Poverty,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, poverty reduction is an urgent challenge that everyone needs to be aware of. Poverty levels have further increased with COVID-19, which could push more residents into poverty due to an uncertain economy, food insecurity, and high cost of living.  To support residents during the pandemic, the Government of Northwest Territories took action on several fronts. During the month of March, income assistance recipients received a one-time emergency allowance.  The GNWT is also taking action to provide supports and protection for individuals requiring shelter. Shelters are often crowded, which can present a risk to both individuals and staff. The GNWT is working with shelters to implement supports for physical distancing and isolation for individuals waiting for test results or who receive a diagnosis of COVID-19. To address homelessness and housing stability, the GNWT provided $600,000 in funding over four years to support a Housing First Program that rents apartments in Yellowknife to house and support up to 25 individuals who were previously homeless and have concurrent mental health and addictions. The Northern Pathways to Housing is a supportive housing program that supports communities to provide stable housing for single adults and help in integrating them into the community. In recent years the Northern Pathways to Housing Program has provided funding to Aklavik, Fort Simpson, Behchokǫ̀, and Fort Good Hope to construct or renovate housing for 16 single adults experiencing homelessness. We look forward to more communities coming on board. Mr. Speaker, to successfully reduce poverty we must work together with our partners to make better use of limited resources. Where there is overlap of programs and services between organizations, we must have better coordination for residents accessing the supports they need. To accomplish this, the GNWT hired a Territorial Director of Integrated Service Delivery to guide a whole of government approach to enhance service delivery across the NWT through a coordinated person-centred approach.  The GNWT also increased funding available for the NGO Stabilization Program from $350,000 to $700,000. This funding supports non-governmental organizations who deliver critical GNWT funded programs or services to the public to stabilize or develop their capacity to manage them. Mr. Speaker, the GNWT recognizes its central role in providing a coordinated approach with Indigenous and community governments, business and industry, and NGOs to take action on reducing poverty in the NWT.  Last year, the GNWT released its renewed Action Plan, Working Together II – An Action Plan to Reduce Poverty in the NWT 2019-2022.  This Action Plan was developed in collaboration between the GNWT and its partners, and focuses on five priority areas: children and family support; healthy living and reaching our potential; safe and affordable housing; sustainable communities; and integrated continuum of services. The GNWT has many programs and services in place that advance these priority areas and provide a path out of poverty for residents. They have already helped thousands of Northerners.  These include initiatives like the Anti-Poverty Fund, which has an annual budget of $1 million to help eligible organizations and Indigenous governments and communities to support their poverty reduction initiatives. This year, 28 recipients were awarded funding through the 2020 Anti-Poverty Fund. Because of COVID-19, proposals were reviewed by the Anti-Poverty Advisory Committee through a virtual meeting. The committee is comprised of nine individuals from across the NWT, and who represent community governments, Indigenous governments, non-government organizations, the private sector, and the GNWT. This year’s successful proposals aim to reduce poverty by supporting food security; assisting those experiencing homelessness; early childhood development; employment and training; healthy living; supporting Traditional Knowledge; and on-the-land activities. The Interdepartmental Anti-Poverty Team is currently working to plan a virtual Anti-Poverty Roundtable, in order to proceed with the event, while still complying with public health orders. The Roundtables will be revised and will now focus on a key poverty reduction issue for each event. This year we will be examining how best to address food security at the community level. Mr. Speaker, we want to ensure that residents have access to supports they need so that they can live in dignity, are free from poverty, and are active members in their communities. We can achieve this through the coordinated and collaborative effort of all partners. By working together, we can learn more about what is being done in communities and support better futures for our residents. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

I am pleased to report that the 2020 community resupply has been successfully completed. The first shipments of the season departed Hay River on July 10 and the last delivery took place on September 19. Nearly 28 million litres of fuel and more than 63 hundred tons of cargo were delivered this season to communities on Great Slave Lake, the Mackenzie River, and the coastal communities.  Mr. Speaker, these deliveries were made possible by our able marine crews who worked tirelessly to overcome challenges posed by record high water levels and bad weather.  From the beginning of this season, MTS developed and executed a robust COVID-19 mitigation plan. Access to our cargo terminals was granted by appointment only, and only to those free of COVID-19 related symptoms. Customers were encouraged to use online forms to avoid in-person contact. To protect communities, designated drop-off cargo zones were created for the delivery of cargo, so that vessel crews would avoid contact with residents. Regardless of the challenges posed by our Arctic environment, MTS remains committed to providing the best service possible to all customers. Our crews know that communities depend on our services for the delivery of essential goods. Mr. Speaker, from deck hands to cooks; 171 people were employed at the peak of the resupply season. 92 of these workers are Northwest Territories residents, 64 are Indigenous. We will continue our relationship with Transport Canada and the Nunavut Fisheries and Marine Training Consortium to promote the Marine Training Centre in Hay River. Programs that are offered at the training centre include a Bridge Watch Rating Program, Small Vessel Operator Proficiency, and a Fishing Master’s Program. Recent graduates have been employed on Canadian Coast Guard Arctic icebreakers and on our research vessel, operated by the Arctic Research Foundation. Nine graduates were employed on our own tugboats this resupply season. These employment and training opportunities positively impact families and communities and support the long-term sustainability of the marine industry in the North. Mr. Speaker, in addition to supporting training opportunities, the GNWT recognizes the need to support the marine industry by improving marine infrastructure and services.  For decades, fuel has been carried through our northern waters to our northern communities in single-hulled barges. Marine Transportation Services is improving our marine fleet with double-hulled barges to minimize the risk of a fuel spill and better protect our environment.  In August, four new double-hulled barges were delivered to Tuktoyaktuk.  These new barges carry cargo on the deck, and below the deck can carry several types of petroleum products at the same time.  I would like to thank the Government of Canada for providing $19.5 million – or 75 per cent of the costs – through the Oceans Protection Plan.

The videos provide an overview of the program and step-by-step instructions on how to take a water sample. The two videos are intended to be valuable resources for NWT communities looking to get more involved in research and monitoring. During the development of Northern Voices, Northern Waters: NWT Water Stewardship Strategy (2010), NWT communities and Indigenous governments highlighted the need to be more involved in water stewardship activities, such as monitoring and research.  The NWT-wide Community-based Water Quality Monitoring Program started in 2012 and was designed to contribute to the NWT Water Stewardship Strategy in three ways: ·       Provide opportunities for local monitors to do water sampling activities ·       Collect water quality information for a baseline data set ·       Help address community concerns about the health of the water   The program involves community members from 21 different communities in the NWT, ENR staff and other water partners. The goal of the monitoring program is to include NWT residents in water quality water monitoring at sites across the NWT to answer community questions about water quality.

Travellers are advised to complete the movement of essential goods and services prior to the closure. The intent is to re-open the highway once ice crossings open for the season. Until that time, drivers are advised to use Highway 1 to enter or leave the territory.  While Highway 8 has remained open in previous years during the changeover, the highway is being closed this year in light of COVID-19, as GNWT border patrol staff cannot easily access certain sections of highway with the ferries out of service. The Commissioner of the Northwest Territories has made this order under the Public Highways Act to support the Chief Public Health Officer’s response to COVID-19. Drivers are reminded that it is unsafe and illegal to drive on a closed highway. Only emergency, enforcement, and construction vehicles are exempted from the closure.

I first want to say that I appreciate it has been a particularly difficult time for seniors here in Yellowknife and across the Northwest Territories.  Being apart from your circle of family and friends can take its toll on the health of seniors.  The purpose of the Covid-19 health orders is to keep residents safe and healthy. It is important that we continue to follow them to limit the spread of COVID, such as keeping our social circle small, wearing masks, social distancing and practicing good hand hygiene. And as flu season will soon be here, I urge anyone who has not yet had their flu shot to do so, as an extra preventative measure to avoid illness and to protect our loved ones.  There was a great turnout to the seniors’ flu clinic at the Baker Centre, with over 500 people getting vaccinated. I know the Health and Social Services Authority is looking into providing additional flu clinics over the next month to ensure everyone who wants the vaccine can access it.  To advance our work of fulfilling the commitment to better serve our senior population and ensure they age in place with dignity, we are in the process of developing an NWT Elders Strategy. Soon we will ask for your ideas and thoughts on the gaps in service and how they can be addressed.  Seniors are a valued part of our NWT communities and one of the mandate commitments of this Legislative Assembly is to enable seniors to age in place with dignity.  In the meantime we are moving forward with improving programs and services offered by multiple GNWT departments and agencies. The NWT Housing Corporation has made a commitment to amend its policies to allow more low income seniors access to housing supports.  The Department of Education, Culture and Employment are committed to creating a separate Income Assistance program tailored to seniors and persons with disabilities. And there is commitment to increase the Seniors Home Heating Subsidy and reduce potential barriers in accessing it. The Department of Health and Social Services is implementing recommendations of the Home and Community Care Review completed in 2019. We want to ensure we can meet the growing demand for Home Care services for seniors as the population ages.  The 22 recommendations that were made will help improve our services to ensure seniors have the best possible home Care services and allow them to remain living in their home and community as long as possible.   To help decrease the gaps found in services for seniors living in community, we are also piloting a Paid Family Caregiver service which is currently running in Yellowknife and surrounding areas. The Department is also working on improving long term care services for those who cannot remain living in their home. This includes renovations to the Stanton Legacy building, which will include 72 new long term care beds.  Another area of concern for seniors is protection from elder abuse.   We continue to support and fund the efforts of the NWT Seniors’ Society to raise awareness about this issue, deliver community public awareness workshops and lead the Network to Prevent Abuse of Older Adults.    We are currently considering the possible need for changes in legislation or programs that will improve protection of seniors from abuse.  In closing, I want to assure you that the Department is committed to providing programs and services that help achieve the best possible quality of life for seniors in Yellowknife and area and the Northwest Territories as a whole.  Thank you. "

The Co-Investment Fund has the potential to bring significant investments into communities across the NWT, working in partnership with all levels of governments, private market investors and non-governmental organizations.   Working with the federal government to improve the program for the NWT is ongoing.  Although, we have had a number of successes including the dedicated “carve off” of $60 million under the fund for the NWT, there is still more work that needs to be done to ensure that this funding works for the NWT. We have heard that applications can take a long time and that the process can be onerous for northern applicants. In both 2019 and 2020 the NWT Housing Corporation met and worked with the federal government to discuss identified problems with the National Housing Co-investment Fund and to seek clarity around easing the restrictive process of making applications under the fund. Mr. Speaker, achieving the goals of the national housing strategy will only be realized once applicants can successfully access these funds. The number of applications coming into the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is increasing, and we are hearing more and more interest from community partners. The NWTHC is continuing to support the implementation of this federal program throughout the NWT. We are conducting joint presentations with CMHC at the community level, and the NWTHC and CMHC have formed a joint review committee for the program which will work to ensure applications are handled in a timely manner. The NWTHC also assists the CMHC by taking a “no wrong door approach”, fielding introductory questions by stakeholders, providing an overview of the process and funneling proponents to CMHC specialists. Additionally, we recognize that the proposal and application approach of the National Housing Co-investment Fund is a barrier for smaller entities in the NWT that face challenges due to limited proposal development capacity. As such, we have also created a community engagement advisor position to promote and market the program, assist developers with applications, and help communities clarify and develop project ideas.  The territorial government, through the NWTHC has the potential to be a primary partner in many Co-Investment Fund projects with the CMHC, and other housing stakeholders.  	This could include partnership in Co-Investment projects through access to NWTHC’s Community Housing Support Initiative.  However, the NWTHC is not required by CMHC to commit upfront 25% of the project costs without first having an opportunity to review a developed business case and resourcing plan that has fully vetted all possible sources of funding.  For example, a proponent’s application could have them accessing up to 95% federal financial assistance through a combination of both low-cost financing and grant, or additional partner contributions.  Maximizing federal partnership and other partners’ contributions is critical to ensure that GNWT funds can be leveraged across numerous projects. Mr. Speaker, we are also making progress on the community housing plans. As we get further into the completion of those plans, we will be identifying opportunities for investment.  This will help with the creation of the business plans and needs assessments that will assist in the selection of projects under the Co-Investment Fund. This is the future of suitable, adequate and affordable housing in the NWT.  With our limited resources we cannot do this alone. The National Housing Co-investment Fund allows for community-led, responsive housing development that will meet the needs of northerners. I encourage all interested partners to reach out the NWTHC and CMHC, 	and I look forward to seeing all the new applications come in.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
413,2020-10-28,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-northwest-territories-housing-corporation-community-engagement-update,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Northwest Territories Housing Corporation Community Engagement Update,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, appropriate community engagement is vitally important to all Government of the Northwest Territories departments and agencies, including the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation.  I know first-hand the value of having the voices of small communities heard at the political level. It is also important to me, that instead of having community representatives come into the capital to discuss their issues and concerns, that I come to them. To speak to our people in their home community, to see housing conditions for myself, to speak with the staff on the ground.  Mr. Speaker, this summer I travelled to 14 of our 33 communities. I had the opportunity to have productive discussions with local and Indigenous leadership in those communities and took those opportunities to highlight the many opportunities of NWT Housing Corporation programming and promote the Community Housing Plan process. During these community visits, I toured housing corporation assets and on-going construction to see what we are putting on the ground. It is one thing, Mr. Speaker, to read in briefing notes about the good work that the corporation is doing, it is another to see that infrastructure come to life. I also had the opportunity to talk with district and local housing staff, congratulating them for the work they have done and discussing areas of improvement. These are our people on the ground in our communities and working hard to get the work done.   Mr. Speaker, it was also very critical for me to highlight on these trips that one of the most effective tools for community engagement is the Community Housing Plan process. These Community Housing Plans are developed hand-in-hand with local and Indigenous governments to ensure that locally appropriate housing solutions are developed for all communities. When completed, these plans will guide and support the housing aspirations of all communities in the NWT. Mr. Speaker, at this time one of these plans, for the community of Whatı̀, have been completed. Further to that, Housing Corporation staff have met with representatives of 	15 other communities to discuss their community housing plans. Despite the difficulties that a global pandemic can present to community engagement activities, I am pleased to say that four more community housing plans are close to completion. We recognize that developing community housing plans for all 33 communities in the NWT is an ambitious undertaking. We are committed to working with all our partners and all community members in a meaningful and respectful way. Development of these plans can take time, especially while ensuring that all of our staff, partners, and community members are following appropriate COVID-19 precautions. But these plans are too important to rush.  I am confident that these plans will be of tremendous benefit to all the communities of the NWT. I look forward to sharing the completed plans with members as they become available and, importantly, I look forward to the improved housing outcomes these plans will bring to our communities. In closing, I want to thank all community leaders and residents who were able to meet with me or simply greet me on the street.  Our schedules as leaders of our government are 	jam-packed and we can not be everywhere at once, but I want to get to the point sometime in our four years, where the appearance of the Housing Minister on any given street in any given community does not seem too out-of-the-ordinary. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
414,2020-10-28,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-improved-mental-health-and-addiction-recovery-services,Government Website,Julie Green: Improved Mental Health and Addiction Recovery Services,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, increasing the number and variety of culturally respectful, 	community-based mental health and addictions programs, including aftercare is a mandate commitment for the Government of the Northwest Territories.  Addictions continue to be a prevalent issue in the Northwest Territories and one that affects far too many of our residents. This government, led by the Department of Health and Social Services, continues to work towards addressing residents’ unique needs and to reduce addictions by providing access to treatment, aftercare supports and recovery. Addictions recovery looks different for each individual, there is no one size fits all approach. As such, the Department is working to improve options and choices for individuals and families as they pursue recovery in a way that works for them. The Stepped Care 2.0 Model, provides rapid same day access to mental wellness and addictions recovery supports that include e-mental health apps, online self-help services and skill–based programming options.  The implementation of a Stepped Care 2.0 Model and approach to care will provide residents with a range of options that they can choose from as and when needed. Stepped Care 2.0 aligns with the Seamless Care Pathway approach. The Seamless Care Pathway,  which is the foundation of the Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Action Plan,  ensures individuals and families have timely access to the right level of care that is solution-focused and based on their present needs. Mr. Speaker, as part of the larger Stepped Care 2.0 approach, we are continuing to enhance the Community Counselling Program. We are now offering same day appointments across the territory to increase access and reduce wait times for residents seeking counselling.  The Department is also continuing to support regional and community Indigenous governments to deliver land-based programming for mental wellness and addictions recovery. Beginning this year the Department will also be working with communities to establish peer support programming like Alcoholics Anonymous, and Wellbriety, at the community level.  Additionally, because the availability of safe sober housing close to home is a key piece of supporting individuals in their recovery, we are also exploring options for a transitional housing model that will meet the needs of NWT residents in recovery.  Mr. Speaker, one of the ways we are enhancing services for addictions recovery, is by adding more options for facility-based addictions treatment. The Department recently issued a request for proposals from southern addictions facilities to provide treatment programming to NWT residents.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that as a result of this RFP process, the number of treatment facilities contracted by the GNWT has increased from four to six.  Effective October 1, 2020 the Department has contracts with Thorpe Recovery Centre, Renascent, Poundmaker’s Treatment Lodge, Fresh Start Recovery Centre, Edgewood Treatment Centre, and Aventa. I have toured some of these facilities and can confirm that services provided are excellent.  By increasing the number of service providers we can ensure we provide a wide range of specialized services including gender-specific programing, family programming, programming for individuals with FASD, medical detox options, expedited intake of pregnant women and extended care options.   Mr. Speaker, we also anticipate that the addition of these two new facilities will help to reduce wait times for treatment.  However, because of the pandemic, every treatment facility is currently operating at reduced capacity. While we anticipate better access in the future, we will likely continue to see longer wait times until these facilities return to full service.  In addition to the expansion of these facility-based options for residents, the Department is also working to implement several eMental Health options. One of these options is an interactive aftercare recovery app. This will be available for NWT residents to support them in their recovery and wellbeing.  Expanding the range of options, Mr. Speaker, means more choice for residents.    The availability of additional options for facility-based treatment, and the enhancement and introduction of other addictions recovery and aftercare programs and support options will ensure residents have access to the right combination of supports at the right time.  These are important steps in providing an improved ability to support mental wellness and addictions recovery, thereby creating meaningful change for individuals, families, communities and the territory as a whole.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

We have all been affected by COVID-19.  Taking action to slow the spread and protect public health has required leaders from all levels of government to act and adjust operations in order to continue serving Northwest Territories residents. Since mid-March the MACA has worked with community governments to identify and monitor impacts to communities, share information about the government’s response to the pandemic, update community emergency plans and ensure continuity of local emergency and essential services.  Community governments have also needed to adapt. Practical challenges have been met with creative solutions such as holding council meetings remotely and making changes to by-laws to do so.  Mr. Speaker, these efforts have been supported, in partnership with the NWT Association of Communities, through virtual town hall meetings with community leaders, that have happened since the beginning of the pandemic. Other Ministers and GNWT officials have collaborated at these meetings to share information and answer questions that leaders have had about specific topics.  I am proud to say that these meetings have fostered engagement between our community governments resulting in responsive “made in the NWT” plans that have helped to provide assistance and support to NWT residents. These include food hampers and on the land supports. MACA also worked with other departments to create multi-media communications about safety during the pandemic, factsheets, and “How to Get Help Guides.”    Mr. Speaker, MACA continues to connect with community governments regularly to share current COVID-19 information, provide support with problems and issues they are encountering, to hear their concerns, to answer any questions they might have, and to provide a mechanism to feed their information into the GNWT response.   Currently, MACA is continuing our work with the health authorities, the Department of Health and Social Services and to engage community governments in providing community specific details and updates to community pandemic plans that reflect the capacity and resources in each community and region to support the health response efforts.    Mr. Speaker, I want to share my gratitude and thanks for the ongoing efforts of community governments to not only maintain support for their residents, as well as their support of the GNWT in maintaining isolation centres and border checkpoints, both on our highways and at the airports. On that note, I also must recognize the GNWT staff, especially those that have put their hands up and redeployed to support the efforts thus far. As the Minister for MACA I want to echo an earlier statement by our Premier and take a moment to recognize them here in the legislature and say thank you. Mr. Speaker, we have benefitted greatly from and appreciate the collaborative and solution-based approach of everyone involved. We thank the leadership in our communities for their efforts and their cooperation. MACA is committed to continue working with communities to share information, to listen, and to respond to issues and concerns. We will work together, to continue to manage the risks, and protect our residents.  Nothing is more important than their safety. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.                       "

In 2017, the Departments of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) and Infrastructure (INF) partnered on a two-year pilot project to help Income Assistance (IA) applicants obtain GICs by waiving fees for approved IA applicants.  GIC costs are waived for residents who are experiencing homelessness, having difficulty obtaining other identification, or who have other challenges affecting their ability to keep their identification updated. The GIC allows them to access services, like opening bank accounts and health care, and assists residents who are required to travel, particularly those individuals requiring out-of-territory medical treatment. To date, the partnership has helped 70 Income Assistance clients to obtain a GIC, at a savings of $51.00 per person.  Quotes: “Providing a means of accessing services and supports gives Income Assistance clients dignity, encourages self-reliance, and creates structure in their lives and the lives of their families.

Major themes outlined during the discussions with NWT residents included the need for government to do a better job of finding efficiencies in programs and services, reducing duplication of services, and being more thoughtful about how we can reduce future costs by making present day investments in the social supports we have in place for residents. Residents also clearly identified the need to demonstrate greater accountability in how the government spends its money to ensure it is not spending more than it has.  The Budget Dialogues consisted of a series of facilitated, online engagement sessions that form a part of the Government of the Northwest Territories’ (GNWT) commitment to developing a more inclusive approach to financial policy setting.  This government remains committed to a more collaborative and open relationship with the public, and will work to incorporate the feedback we received through this process into future budgets wherever possible. The Minister will be hosting a final public engagement session on Thursday, November 5, 2020 at 7pm where she will outline the main themes and concerns identified by participants during the public sessions held in July.  More information on how to participate in this event is located on the Department of Finance’s website. The What We Heard Report was tabled today in the Legislative Assembly and is available for review on the Department of Finance’s website.   Quote “Renewing our approach to budgeting and financial decision making so our spending is better aligned with the needs and priorities of residents and the Legislative Assembly is a priority for our government. Hearing from residents through our Budget Dialogues is one of the steps we are taking to ensure we are achieving that alignment and creating better value for the people of the NWT..  ”   -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance   Quick Facts: ·       As many as 249 individuals logged onto the four public webinars held in July 2020. ·       189 written inquiries and comments were sent to the Minister of Finance by participants during the four public sessions.  ·       In addition, four separate stakeholder sessions with business representatives, non-government organizations, Indigenous governments, and municipal leaders were also held with the Finance Minister.  ·       Northwest Territories residents were also invited to answer an online survey or provide submissions; a total of 426 responses were received.     Related Links:   ·       What We Heard Report: Budget Dialogues 2020 ·       Public Session hosted by Minister Wawzonek  on the What We Heard Report ·       Budget Dialogues 2020"

427,2020-10-22,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-archie-update-strategic-infrastructure-projects,Government Website,Diane Archie: Update on Strategic Infrastructure Projects,"Check against delivery    Mr. Speaker, the 19th Legislative Assembly has identified making strategic infrastructure investments that connect communities, expand the economy or reduce the cost of living as one of its priorities.  This includes a focus on the Mackenzie Valley Highway, the Slave Geological Province Corridor, and the Taltson Hydro Expansion Project. It is important that these development projects are advanced in a balanced and sustainable way that supports our government’s goal to manage and conserve wildlife, and protect and provide for the health and well-being of the people of the Northwest Territories. The establishment of strong relationships with Indigenous governments and organizations is imperative to the successful advancement of these important projects.  We are achieving this by working closely with affected groups from project initiation through to the construction and operations phases.  The Government of the Northwest Territories has four major initiatives currently progressing along the Mackenzie Valley Highway alignment from Wrigley to Norman Wells. These are: the Prohibition Creek Access Road, the Mount Gaudet Access Road, the Great Bear River Bridge, and the Mackenzie Valley Highway Environmental Assessment. The Department of Infrastructure has been working closely with Indigenous governments and communities with multiple visits to the Sahtu Settlement Area and the Dehcho Region. We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Sahtu Secretariat, and are working closely with the Pehdzeh Ki First Nation, including the establishment of a training committee.  Mr. Speaker, regulatory applications have been filed for the construction of both the Prohibition Creek Access Road and the Mount Gaudet Access Road, with the plan to start construction in 2021. The next major step in the Mackenzie Valley Highway Environmental Assessment is filing the Developer’s Assessment Report. The Department is gathering data and completing studies with the target of submitting the report to the Mackenzie Valley Review Board before the end of the 2021-2022 fiscal year.  The construction of the Great Bear River Bridge will increase our infrastructure’s resilience to climate change by providing an all-season alternative to the ice road crossing at the Mackenzie River and the Great Bear River. In 2018, engagement and consultation for this project began with public engagement sessions in all five Sahtu communities on the route selection and design of the bridge. The Tulita Renewable Resource Council has completed a Traditional Knowledge Study on the area, and we will continue to work closely with the Hamlet Mayor and Council moving forward. The project team is considering all options for the tendering process so that we maximize local and northern content.  Mr. Speaker, our next large strategic infrastructure project is the Slave Geological Province Corridor, which will enable future mineral exploration and development in a region with significant resource potential, and assisting with reclamation of mines in the region upon closure. The long-term vision includes a corridor that supports road, communications, and hydroelectric transmission line infrastructure.  In the near term, the GNWT will be focusing on advancing the Lockhart All-Season Road, an all-season road from Tibbitt Lake at the end of Highway No. 4, the Ingraham Trail, all the way to Lockhart Lake. Building partnerships with Indigenous governments is crucial to the success of this important project. Establishing a Memorandum of Understanding with Indigenous governments and organizations would set the stage to begin the collective development of a project plan that will not only chart a path forward, but will also help Indigenous partners to identify and prepare in advance for opportunities the project will present for contracts, jobs, and training. Mr. Speaker, finally, the Taltson hydro expansion is the most promising option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide renewable energy to the territory. The new generation and transmission infrastructure will provide a stable, drought-resistant and accessible combined system for 10 NWT communities. It will also position existing and future resource development projects to use clean energy to support more sustainable economic growth while reducing fossil fuel use and meeting the NWT’s environmental commitments under the Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. Transmission from the 60-megawatt Hydro Expansion could head north and connect Yellowknife’s Snare and Bluefish hydro systems and set the stage for new and existing industrial customers to access clean hydro power north and south of Great Slave Lake. The Government of the Northwest Territories is working with NWT-based Indigenous governments and stakeholders to create a collaborative partnership approach to project development.  To assist with that work, the federal government allocated $18 million over three years from Crown-Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada to advance the Taltson Expansion project. Part of that funding was provided in grants to each of the Indigenous government partners including the Northwest Territory Métis Nation, the Salt River First Nation, and the Akaitcho Dene First Nations, to support their participation in project development, which includes defining the structure and business case, guiding upcoming field work, and development of a Memorandum of Understanding to define our working relationship. We continue to work with other affected parties to address their concerns and find a way forward on the project.  Mr. Speaker, in summary, the Department of Infrastructure has and will continue to work closely with Indigenous governments and organizations as we advance our many projects to connect communities.  While we do sometimes have tough issues to discuss and resolve, we are working with our partners to ensure that as much of the benefits on industrial development stay right here at home and benefit northerners.    Quana, Mr. Speaker.

428,2020-10-22,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-aurora-college-transformation-progress-and-benefits,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Aurora College Transformation Progress and Benefits,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, one year ago, Members of this House made the transformation of Aurora College into a polytechnic university a priority of the 19th Legislative Assembly. Today, I would like to provide an update on some of the progress that has been made toward this goal. Earlier this month, Aurora College released a three-year Strategic Plan which sets out the vision, mission, values, and strategic directions that will guide the college’s operations for the next three years, and helps set the stage for key transformational changes. Two of the four strategic pillars of the new plan are Academic and Research Excellence and Learning-Centered. In support of these pillars, Aurora College is introducing a Centre for Teaching and Learning pilot project that will promote academic excellence through the professional development of faculty and staff in the practices of adult education, instructional design, educational technology, and will promote proven ways to engage students in learning. The Centre will foster a learning-centred environment to help ensure student growth and success. It is a key step in strengthening the foundation of the College, and transforming it into a world class institution. Mr. Speaker, polytechnic universities provide hands-on, technology-based programs that are often developed in collaboration with partners.  We have already heard from a number of potential co-investment partners, from industry to community-based organizations, who have told us that they need a Northern workforce with the academic background and technical skills to meet the challenges of today’s economic realities.  We will continue to foster these relationships and build the partnerships so we can meet the needs of the labour market and our residents.  To support transparency and meaningful engagement we have engaged with Indigenous governments, campus communities, post-secondary and industry stakeholders, students, College employees and the public on key aspects of the proposed approach.  Engagement with Indigenous governments is being guided by our Indigenous Engagement Approach which is grounded in the principles of United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action. I have made a commitment to ongoing and meaningful engagement with Indigenous governments throughout the transformation.  Mr. Speaker, the polytechnic university will expand the scope of quality programming offered in each of our small communities and provide a clear path for Northerners to achieve their education and career goals. Understanding the benefits and limitations of online learning during the pandemic has strengthened the resolve of the College to transform into an institution that will meet the needs of residents in all communities.   Increased access means leveraging our network of community learning centres to ensure residents can get a foothold in the education system and receive more training close to home.   This will also allow the institution to better meet students where they are in their education journey. This means, among other things, introducing laddered programming that allows students to begin their education at a level that is right for them, so they are able to build their skills and advance onto degree programs if they chose. Increasing access will also increase professional development opportunities across the territory that will empower our residents to advance in their careers and help fill Northern jobs with Northerners. As the polytechnic university emerges from transformation, it will be stronger, more accessible, and have more programs which will attract more students from the Northwest Territories and beyond. This investment in the education of our residents is an investment in our territory and its future.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The annual report allows the Department to examine the system and find ways to evolve our service to better meet the needs of children, youth and families in the NWT.  The Department uses this data report as an opportunity to provide insight on the experience and outcomes of children and youth supported by child and family services.   The approach for the report has been refreshed to make the information more accessible and relevant for the public while maintaining the integrity of data reporting. The 2019-2020 annual report presents data on the delivery of child and family services across the Northwest Territories from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.  Findings from the report show a continued decreasing trend in the number of children and youth under a Permanent Custody Order. This development suggests a positive movement in the strength and resiliency of communities to support families and their children – a movement that aligns with the Federal Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis Child, Youth and Families that came into force on January 1, 2020. Over 90% of children and youth who received prevention and protection services were living in their family home or with a foster caregiver in their home community. By helping children and youth stay in their homes and communities, they are able to maintain their cultural identity and family connections. This aligns with the Federal Act’s guiding principle that children and youth have a right to cultural continuity.  The report shows that 98% of children and youth who received prevention and protection services were Indigenous. This overrepresentation is a call to strengthen a variety of partnerships to improve the lives of children, youth and families across the NWT.   Quote “This report provides insight on the experience and outcomes of children and youth supported by child and family services; and how we can evolve our services to better meet their needs.”  - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services   Quick facts ·       In the past fiscal year, 1,239 children and youth received prevention or protection services from Child and Family Services System: o   54% received Voluntary Support Services o   33% received services through a Plan of Care Agreement o   10% received supports through a Permanent Custody Order o   3% received supports through a Temporary Custody Order. ·       Over 90% of children and youth who received prevention and protection services were living in their family home or with a caregiver in their home community. ·       98% of children and youth receiving prevention and protection services were Indigenous.   Related links ·       2019-2020 Annual Report of the Director of Child and Family Services  ·       Quality Improvement Plan ·       Minister Julie Green’s Statement on Child and Family Services Update     Damien Healy Manager, Communications Department of Health and Social Services Tel:  867-767-9052 ext. 49034 Email:   damien_healy@gov.nt.ca  "
431,2020-10-21,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/taking-care-our-mental-health-during-covid-19-pandemic,Government Website,Taking care of our Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Premier Caroline Cochrane provided the following statement on mental health and well-being of NWT residents during the COVID-19 pandemic: “It has been nearly eight months since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been one of the most challenging times in our lives, and has put us all to the test. “During these difficult times the pandemic has put increased pressure on our mental health and well-being. The pandemic has threatened our health, impacted our economic well-being, and disconnected us from the support networks we rely on. Whether it’s a family member, close friend, or co-worker, the issue of mental health hits close to home for many of us.  “Now more than ever, we need to be talking about our mental health. Self-care is so important to a healthy life, but we often dismiss it as less deserving of our time and attention. Whether it be from fear of discrimination or stigmatization, there are too many NWT residents suffering in silence, left feeling anxious, isolated, and worried about what the future holds.  “With the arrival of a second wave in Canada, we must do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19 now more than ever. That includes treating individuals who test positive, either presumptive or confirmed, with respect, empathy and kindness. Even with taking every precaution people may still get COVID-19.  As neighbors we should be reaching out to support each other, not condemning each other. Don’t give in to the temptation to spread rumours or speculation that might be hurtful to other people in  your community and territory.  I believe that one of the lasting legacies of COVID-19 will be how we treated one another and I encourage all NWT residents to support those who are suffering.  “To get through this, we all need to be there for one another. We all play an important role to encourage a society where we can all talk about mental health openly. We need to work together to affect change around the attitudes and stigma that exists – and this starts with being kind to one another. Whether it is someone you know or a complete stranger, I ask all NWT residents to show compassion and understanding – we can’t always see the challenges people are facing on a daily basis.  “This is a difficult time for everyone, and the Government of the Northwest Territories has a number of programs and services available for NWT residents to help them through the struggles they are faced with, particularly in our smaller communities. The NWT Community Counselling Program  offers free counselling support for mental wellness, addictions recovery, and family violence. The NWT Help Line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for free at 1-800-661-0844. NWT residents and families can access the Strongest Families Institute, an e-Mental Health services delivered over the phone for supports related to anxiety and depression.  “Our government is committed to ensuring a healthy and vibrant NWT, and this includes making sure our most vulnerable residents aren’t left behind. You are not alone. If someone you know is having a difficult time, reach out to them. If you are having a hard time, reach out and ask for help. We are all in this together.”"
432,2020-10-21,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-pivoting-support-nwt-businesses-through-covid,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Pivoting to Support NWT Businesses through COVID,"Mr. Speaker, in addition to describing these times as unprecedented, the need to “pivot” business models and methods has become one of the buzz words during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Almost all businesses in the Northwest Territories have had to adjust the way they operate or do business.  There was obviously a need to invest in order to protect employees and clients such as through protective barriers or personal protective equipment.  Beyond that, in many cases, businesses have actually changed the way they offer their goods or services: from going online to then offering curbside pick-up; and from staycations, to offering new products that respond to new needs. Northwest Territories businesses have done so much to respond to the circumstances of COVID-19.   In turn, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment continues to respond to the changing needs of the NWT’s business community.  New COVID-focused Support for Entrepreneurs and Economic Development guidelines were introduced early on in the pandemic, favouring projects that would help businesses recover – and contribute to the recovery of others.  An additional new funding option was introduced for NWT artists and commercial film and media arts producers whose activities and revenues were restricted due to physical-distancing requirements. In June, as our government moved to Phase II of the Emerging Wisely Plan, the Support for Entrepreneurs and Economic Development program was adapted again, to specifically support businesses re-opening or pivoting to meet new operating requirements.  In an already challenging year for mineral exploration, we were able to make changes to our Mining Incentive Program that helped companies navigate COVID, related costs and prioritized NWT-based service providers. Through this program we distributed $1 million to seven companies and 13 prospectors. Mr. Speaker, it is not only businesses who have had to change direction. With less than a year to go until the release of our 2021-2025 tourism strategy, and with a sudden and necessary new focus on recovery, we went back to the drawing board this summer re-engaging with the tourism industry on a new set of questions and seeking opportunities for both short- and long-term rebuilding through a COVID lens. In order to help support this particularly hard hit sector, ITI, in partnership with CanNor, created the Growth and Recovery by Investing in Tourism, or GRIT, as a new initiative that helps respond to the needs of NWT businesses. By moving budgets away from international marketing, the $1.5 million GRIT fund was introduced in August and by September, it was clear that the initiative was going to be over-subscribed so we have since taken additional steps to meet this demand.   Mr. Speaker, back in July the BuyNorth Campaign was also introduced, in partnership with Northern News Services Limited Media, to support and promote businesses as they pivot, re-open and start to recover from the impacts of COVID.  This, too, was a new approach to business support. ITI sponsorship allows all NWT businesses to have a presence on the BuyNorth web page for free – and provides an umbrella for other initiatives like the NWT Chamber’s #shopNWT campaign to heighten the importance and appreciation for shopping local. Mr. Speaker, in April and May, at the height of the pandemic and with strict economic lockdown measures in place, NWT businesses saw revenues decline by an average of 63% - and almost 70% were in the challenging position of being closed or partially closed.   Yet, 93% of NWT businesses surveyed at the time still felt that they would be able to survive.  Mr. Speaker, I have described a few ways businesses have pivoted and ways that ITI has helped support some of those efforts. To pivot means not only to turn and change once; it can also mean the changing continues as circumstances develop. Northern businesses and entrepreneurs have kept changing and staying current and responsive to these unprecedented times. Mr. Speaker, the government, too, will continue to adapt its response and supports to these changing needs. Just as our business community has stayed responsive, so too will the support from the GNWT.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
433,2020-10-21,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-child-and-family-services-update,Government Website,Julie Green: Child and Family Services Update,"Mr. Speaker, taking action to improve services and supports to reduce the number of Indigenous children and youth in the care is a priority for this government.  The 2019-2020 Annual Report of the Director of Child and Family Services that I will be tabling later today, shows a continued trend of overrepresentation of Indigenous children and youth receiving protection and prevention services under our legislation. This is a national issue, Mr. Speaker and was raised in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s Calls to Action, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children. To advance the calls for action, the Federal Act Respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families came into force on January 1, 2020. The Federal Act recognizes the inherent rights of Indigenous communities to provide care for their children and youth. It aligns with work that the Government of the Northwest Territories has already been doing. This includes, supporting Indigenous children and youth by helping them stay with their family and community, and reducing the number of children and youth separated from their families only because of financial, health or housing challenges.   Mr. Speaker, we fully support the Federal Act, and we are affirming our commitment to having an ongoing dialogue with Indigenous governments and communities to ensure that our system advances the best interests of children, youth and families. We will continue to work collaboratively in supporting communities and families to preserve family and cultural continuity for our territory’s children and youth.  Mr. Speaker, work is already underway in supporting the implementation of the Federal Act. The Department of Health and Social Services has added a new action into its Quality Improvement Plan to enhance practice standards that align with the Federal Act’s national principles.  The Quality Improvement Plan, which was released in August 2019, sets out actions that the Department is taking to best meet the needs of NWT children, youth and families. The measurement I am most proud of is that over 90% of children receiving support from Child and Family Services live with their family or in their home community. Even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department made steady progress with the actions identified in the Quality Improvement Plan. This is important to the GNWT so we have made additional investments to add 20 new positions that ensures we have appropriate resources to help improve compliance, and support children, youth, families and foster caregivers.  Mr. Speaker, the 2018-2019 audits for the Child and Family Services were completed across the system in June. The audits identified pressure points within the regions that need to be resolved to ensure continued service improvements. The Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authorities submitted their action plans in response to the audits and are actively working on addressing key areas for service in each of the regions. The Department has provided funding to foster caregivers and foster care staff from across the NWT to participate in training on best practices on how to better support children and youth with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.  Last year, we saw a decrease in the vacancy rate for staff from 25% to 8.6%. The Department and Authorities also expanded staff engagement opportunities through all staff regular meetings, implementation of an anonymous feedback mechanism and satisfaction surveys. This allows for opportunities to better support staff, which we hope will lead to better staff retention. Having a stable workforce in Child and Family Services is instrumental to overall improvement strategies. Because of the resources required for the GNWT COVID-19 response, the Child and Family Services system experienced delays in the ongoing completion of some quality reviews. However, the pandemic also created opportunities for the Department and Authorities to work with partners on some new initiatives. We partnered with the Foster Family Coalition of the NWT to implement a respite program to support foster caregivers during the pandemic. The Department also expanded support services for families by providing short-term financial support to purchase necessities such as diapers, food, and fuel to meet their basic unmet needs.  The Department also extended support services for youth in care and young adults who would have aged out of the Child and Family Services system in the midst of this global crisis. We will monitor the effectiveness of these initiatives, and how they might be added into the service delivery as part of its commitment towards continual quality improvement. Mr. Speaker, each year the Department presents an Annual Report of the Director of Child and Family Services. The Report enables the Department and the public to monitor trends to assess whether the actions taken are making a difference for the well-being of NWT children, youth and families. Findings from the report help to grow a more responsive system to the evolving needs of children, youth and families. The 2019-2020 Annual Report shows some positive indications that we are on the right track. Over the past ten years we have seen a decreasing trend in the number of children and youth under a Permanent Custody Order. We are seeing a positive movement in the strength and resiliency of communities to support families and their children. Over 90% of children and youth who received prevention and protection services were living in their family home or with a foster caregiver in their home community. This change allows for continued connections with family and community while ensuring cultural continuity, which is so important in protecting the identity of the child. Mr. Speaker, as a government, we have a legal and moral duty to protect the well-being and safety of children and youth, and ensuring their families receive the right kinds of support. To accomplish this, I will maintain an open dialogue with Members, Indigenous governments and communities, as well as key stakeholders to explore opportunities to better support children, youth, and families.    October is Foster Family Recognition month and I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation to all foster caregivers across the Northwest Territories.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
434,2020-10-21,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-archie-supporting-community-employment-and-economic-development-small-communities,Government Website,Diane Archie: Supporting Community Employment and  Economic Development in Small Communities,"Mr. Speaker, increasing employment in small communities is one of the priorities outlined in the priorities for the 19th Legislative Assembly. Now more than ever, as we begin to plan for social and economic recovery from COVID-19, we need to ensure there are opportunities for meaningful employment and economic development for our people to keep our communities and territory strong.  I grew up in a small community, Aklavik, where I learned the importance of having a strong community. While our large strategic infrastructure projects are often in the spotlight, we need to give credit to our Regional Operations and smaller-scale projects for making an impact on the lives of Northerners with the opportunities they present.  Mr. Speaker, part of the Department of Infrastructure’s core business is the delivery of programs, services and projects by our staff in all regions of the territory. Almost two thirds of Infrastructure staff work outside of headquarters in regional offices, with 329 employees based in regional centres, and 46 located in smaller communities.  Infrastructure’s Regional Operations work hard to keep our 863 GNWT-owned buildings running smoothly.  They also oversee the construction, operations and maintenance of the highway system, including over 2,400 kilometres of all-weather roads, over 1,400 kilometres of winter roads, and four ferries.  Mr. Speaker, that is a lot of work, and we cannot do it alone. Many projects and operations are contracted to local communities and/or businesses, which allows the government to operate efficiently, while creating employment at the local level.  Some of these contracts include our ferries, where three of NWT’s four ferries are operated by local contractors. We also have contracts in place with 14 NWT businesses for highway maintenance, some of which are with Indigenous and community governments. Out of 27 airports in the territory, eight are operated and maintained by Infrastructure staff, and operations at the 19 smaller airports are contracted to local businesses.  Motor vehicle issuing services are also provided at the regional level through a mix of GNWT staff and contractors.  On top of our operational work in the regions, the Department of Infrastructure is also making strategic investments in our territory’s future. In partnership with the federal government, we are advancing several significant infrastructure projects. The 2020-2021 Infrastructure Acquisition Plan will deliver a total of 152 capital projects in 28 NWT communities, including schools, long-term care and health care facilities, and major transportation projects.  Mr. Speaker, to help our residents benefit from these projects, we must increase training and employment. Led by the Department of Infrastructure, the GNWT is working with its project partners to incorporate training opportunities that will lead to maximized benefits for residents. For example, the GNWT and the Pehdzéh Kı̨́ First Nation together established the Wrigley Mackenzie Valley Highway Training Committee to identify training opportunities for that project, to facilitate development and delivery of training programs for the residents of Wrigley, and to facilitate access to funding for these programs.   Similarly, we worked with North Star Infrastructure to include training requirements in the Project Agreement for the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road project. As of late this summer, almost nine thousand hours of training have been provided to Tłı̨chǫ citizens in different areas such as heavy equipment operator, cook, crushing operation, and job readiness training. Now that the end of its construction is in sight, these individuals will be able apply the skills they have developed on other jobs.  Mr. Speaker, providing employment and economic development opportunities will help support our communities as we recover from the economic impacts caused by the pandemic, and beyond. Providing employment opportunities are important for the cultural preservation of our communities, so we can continue to engage in our traditional activities and pass on teachings to the next generation. The GNWT will continue our work to support the residents of our small communities.  Quana, Mr. Speaker."

Mr. Speaker, A number of steps have already been taken by public health staff to minimize any potential risk to communities.   Immediate household members of the individual and identified contacts were quickly informed and directed to isolate, and given appropriate public health advice.  Public Health has arranged for immediate testing of these contacts.   The contact investigation is ongoing and further updates to Members and to the public will be provided once more information is available.  There are two crucial things each of us must do to help in this situation.  	First, we need to be kind and respectful to one another. Stigmatizing behaviors hurt all of us because it places the focus on individuals instead of focusing on doing our part to manage the virus appropriately. It has the potential to discourage people from accessing health care, and being honest with health professionals.  Second, we need to remember that we all have control in this situation. No matter the situation in the community, you are empowered to practice routine public health precautions which will work to keep you and others safer.  Prioritize physical distance of at least six feet, or two metres Wear a non-medical mask when keeping distance is difficult Keep crowds small and spaces large to reduce the risk of transmission Frequently washing your hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer Please maintain self-isolation if you are required to.  Stay home if you’re feeling sick – even if your symptoms are mild And If you develop any symptoms, contact your local healthcare centre to be assessed for COVID-19.  As I receive more details from the Chief Public Health Officer, I will provide additional information to this House and to the public.  I encourage everyone to be kind, and stay safe.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  "

438,2020-10-20,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-supporting-municipalities,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Supporting Municipalities,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to update the Members on the progress we have made with our mandate commitment to reduce the municipal funding gap by $5 million in the life of this government. We recognize the important role that community governments play in our economy and the provision of core programs and services. Community governments are essential partners in delivering programs and services to meet the need of NWT residents, and they require adequate resources for this important work. I am pleased to confirm that we are making progress on this mandate commitment. In this fiscal year we added $2.6 million to community funding and will continue to seek additional increases in future budgets. Mr. Speaker, this additional community government funding is welcome news to our community governments. Since its beginning, MACA has worked with the NWT Association of Communities and its members on the funding strategy. As part of that ongoing engagement, we are determining how best to allocate the $2.6 million. The GNWT is matching the federal investment in Safe Restart Funding for municipalities. This winter, we will be rolling out approximately $4.7 million to help our communities put in place appropriate precautions to manage public spaces and critical services and safely restart operations. Reducing the municipal funding gap is not just about additional funding. It is also about supporting communities to provide new opportunities to raise additional revenues, and to reduce or stabilize the cost of delivering core services. Mr. Speaker, three key initiatives the department is advancing to support community governments in these areas are: MACA is working with other GNWT departments on a process guide on how to transfer land with municipal boundaries and I expect to share the draft this winter. This guide will set the path for providing community governments to acquire ownership and manage land currently held by the GNWT within their boundaries. Community governments will have the ability to take over management functions and enforcement, and, if desired, sell land which offers an opportunity for own source revenue. The department is supporting communities to find efficiencies in their program delivery. Assisting communities to put in place a responsive plan through the asset management system will improve maintenance and lower the costs of equipment failures and emergency repairs. This will allow community leaders to have access to improved information when making investment decisions and be able to maximize their available resources. The NWT Waste Resource Management Strategy has a strong focus for community governments. MACA will be working with communities to eliminate hazardous waste stockpiles within their solid waste sites. Resources and support that we have for community governments in solid waste management are being adapted. Through better management, better operations of their solid waste sites will not only improve environmental stewardship but can significantly increase the lifespan of community sites and defer the need for costly investment. Mr. Speaker, some community governments face significant pressures to deliver quality programs and services. We see that, we get it. Through our increased investment and support for land management and facility management, we are working hard to help communities manage these challenges. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
439,2020-10-20,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-water-monitoring,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Water Monitoring,"Mr. Speaker, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources is responsible for the implementation of the NWT Water Stewardship Strategy, including transboundary water management agreements and water monitoring throughout the Northwest Territories. Together with our partners, we track long-term trends and monitor changes in water quality, quantity and biology. In March of this year, the Government of Canada shut down its labs and suspended long-term water quality monitoring across Canada due to concerns related to COVID-19. The Alberta government also suspended monitoring water quality at that time throughout the province.  This included some key monitoring sites that are part of our transboundary agreement with Alberta. These sites are part of an early warning system, which lets us know about changes to the water before the Northwest Territories border. Mr. Speaker, as soon as we heard about this decision, I along with Environment and Natural Resources officials reached out to the governments of Alberta and Canada, to explain the importance of reinstating this very important monitoring. We also worked closely with the Government of Canada to resume water monitoring at key federal long-term monitoring sites.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that the monitoring that makes up our early warning system is now back up and running. The Alberta government resumed its monitoring in June, and Oil Sands Monitoring has been in place since August. Environment and Natural Resources quickly adapted its fieldwork procedures so it could continue to monitor water in the Northwest Territories safely during the pandemic with only slight delays, and for this the department should be commended. Our transboundary agreements are the most comprehensive of their kind. In addition to the commitments on water quality and quantity, these agreements also recognize the importance of biological indicators and traditional knowledge. Triggers set under the agreements, which are reported on in annual reports, help ensure that any issues that could put Northwest Territories waters at risk can be addressed early on. Mr. Speaker, water levels this year across parts of the Mackenzie River Basin have been very high. Water levels on Great Slave Lake were higher than we have ever seen. This has caused changes in the water. More dirt or sediment is being washed into the lakes and rivers, and there was a larger plume of sediment in Great Slave Lake lasting later in the season. Higher sediment has also resulted in higher concentrations of metals in some cases the highest levels ever recorded in the Slave and Hay Rivers. Although total metal concentrations are higher than usual, they are not in a form that is readily available to be taken up by aquatic species. The work to analyze water samples gathered this summer is ongoing, and we plan to release the results as they are available. Environment and Natural Resources is also working with our neighbours in Alberta and British Columbia to better understand the contributions from upstream watersheds to water levels in Great Slave Lake, including the role of the Bennett Dam in British Columbia.  Many Northerners are wondering what will happen to water levels this winter. We already know the high-water levels are mostly due to more rain and snow across Alberta and the southern Northwest Territories, some areas received up to twice as much rain this year. Environment and Natural Resources is taking a closer look at the factors affecting water levels and will release the results of this work once complete. Mr. Speaker, the health of our water is of critical importance to residents of the Northwest Territories. Environment and Natural Resources will continue to collaborate with our transboundary partners to manage water resources in a sustainable manner to maintain the ecological integrity of the Mackenzie River Basin, for present and future generations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The PricewaterhouseCoopers report Tax and royalty benchmark - Mining in the Northwest Territories marks the first post-Devolution review of the Northwest Territories (NWT) tax and royalty system and provides an up-to-date reference point on its ranking. It highlights where the NWT’s industry is positioned in comparison to a decade ago. The report provides a benchmark for the GNWT’s promised review of the NWT’s mining regime. The review, which is part of the GNWT’s work to develop regulations for its new Mineral Resources Act, will support the GNWT mandate to: Adopt a Benefit Retention Approach to Economic Development.  The last significant review and benchmarking of the NWT regime was completed in 2007-2008 by the Government of Canada. The PricewaterhouseCoopers report used a consistent methodology to allow the GNWT to assess and compare data from both reviews.   Quote “The re-imagining of our government’s fiscal framework around royalties is one that deserves a comprehensive, collaborative, and multi-phased approach – and that’s what we will give it. This document is an initial step. The upcoming review of the NWTs mining regime will be founded on a variety of inputs including an extended and extensive period of consultation with Indigenous governments, communities, industry and members of the public.”   - Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment    Quick facts ·       The report provides no recommendations for amendments to the royalty regulations.  ·       Based on the parameters provided, it concludes that the NWT is receiving a fair return in line with the other Canadian jurisdictions.  ·       A peer review of The PricewaterhouseCoopers report was conducted by Michael Doggett and Associates, a mineral economics consultancy team based in Vancouver.

443,2020-10-19,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-nwt-eservices-portal,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: NWT eServices Portal,"Check against delivery   Mr. Speaker, this government is committed to making its programs, services and functions accessible to people in as many ways as possible. We are also committed to keeping up with the worldwide shift towards online portals to access information and services of all kinds.  Our goal is that to the greatest extent possible, people should be able to access Government of the Northwest Territories’ programs and services how they want, where they want, and when they want. The eServices team within the Department of Finance is close to a major milestone that will support our work towards this goal of greater accessibility: the launch of the new NWT eServices Portal. This new portal will allow people and businesses to access programs and services online, from one safe and reliable location. It is worth noting, over the past six months, the importance of online services has been only further highlighted as our residents have adapted to working remotely and socially distancing. The goal of the portal is to provide users with secure and convenient online access to GNWT programs and services through a single account. Once it is launched by the end of 2020, residents will be able to use it to register for and renew their Healthcare Cards and request birth, death and marriage certificates. Existing Driver and Motor Vehicle services, existing MyECE services, and an improved online application for NWT Fishing Licenses will also be accessible through the new portal.   This initial bundle of services is just the start of our efforts to bring more programs and services online, and we plan to add a second bundle of services to the portal in early 2021. Additional on-going releases will continue to be prioritized, planned and launched moving forward.  Mr. Speaker, we all know that the demand for online programs and services is high; as Minister of Finance, I am committed to making sure that this department works across government to ensure that we are doing our best to meet the needs of people and businesses by bringing the right programs and services online through the portal.  Further, we are committed to protecting the security and privacy of our users’ data. As we speak, the eServices team is conducting thorough privacy and security assessments of the portal, all integrated back-end systems and each service being connected. As I stated earlier, it is important that we provide our people and businesses with access to programs and services how they want, where they want, and when they want. So, let me very clear about another aspect of this improvement: The new eServices Portal creates an additional way to access the GNWT’s programs and services, it does not take away or diminish the other access points to government services. For clarity, this means that a resident can choose to access a program or service online or can continue to access that program or service how they always have – on the phone, in person, or through other access points. This milestone shows how we will execute our commitment, as a government, to providing the best possible service and constantly exploring innovative and creative ways to improve that service. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
444,2020-10-19,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-archie-update-2030-energy-strategy,Government Website,Diane Archie: Update on the 2030 Energy Strategy,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, despite the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Government of Northwest Territories has continued to roll out energy initiatives under the 2030 Energy Strategy Action Plan that will help ensure NWT residents, communities, businesses and industry have access to secure, affordable and sustainable energy. The Government of the Northwest Territories has made a mandate commitment to strengthen our leadership and authority on climate change, and one way we will achieve this is through the implementation of the 2030 Energy Strategy. As Members of this Legislative Assembly know, the Energy Strategy has six Strategic Objectives to reach the 2030 vision. They include:  Working together to find solutions: community engagement, participation and empowerment; Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in diesel-powered communities by an average of 25%; Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from road vehicles by 10% per capita; Increasing the share of renewable energy used for space heating to 40%; Increasing residential, commercial, and government building energy efficiency by 15%; and The longer-term vision: developing the NWT’s energy potential, addressing industrial emissions, and doing our part to meet national climate change objectives Mr. Speaker, I’d like to update Members today on the status of achieving these objectives.  A number of community projects have been funded jointly by the territorial and federal governments under the Greenhouse Gas Grant Program to reduce the use of fuel and lower emissions. For example, the YK1 School Board received funding to install wood pellet boilers in two Yellowknife school facilities, and the Town of Fort Smith was funded to make energy efficiency and electric heating upgrades in three town buildings. The Arctic Energy Alliance, AEA, also continued its Regional Office Program, which operates six regional offices to engage with communities, promote AEA programs, and provide support for local energy projects. Last year, this program invested $800,000 into the work of these offices, resulting in over a million dollars’ worth of energy rebates paid directly to communities, business and residents outside of Yellowknife for things like energy efficient appliances, efficiency upgrades to buildings, and alterative heating like wood stoves.  This is out of a total AEA budget of about $5.9million, of which there was a record total of $1.9 million in rebates given out across the NWT last year.  Over 50 percent of these rebates were provided to communities outside of Yellowknife. The GNWT is advancing a project to build a 170-kilometer transmission line from the Taltson hydro system to serve Fort Providence, Kakisa, and Dory Point. This project is essential for the NWT to meet its greenhouse gas reduction commitments, providing about 15 percent of our total reduction target for electricity generation, and would remove up to one million litres of diesel and 2.75 kilotonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually. The project will use power from the existing Taltson system to eliminate the use of diesel for electrical generation in these communities and reduce the cost of power. Mr. Speaker, to help residents reduce their emissions from transportation, the AEA launched an electric vehicle rebate program in June of this year, which provides rebates of $5,000 for new electric vehicles and up to $500 for charging stations in hydropower communities. The GNWT is also exploring new technologies that could help reduce transportation emissions, including liquid biofuels. The Department is currently conducting a study that will not only help us understand whether liquid biofuels can work in a cold northern climate, but also how factors like availability, storage, and cost affect their feasibility in Northern climates. This study is scheduled to be completed in early 2021. With new federal funding from the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund, the AEA launched new and expanded programs and nearly doubled the number of rebates it provided in 2019-2020 compared to the previous year, for an increase of 150 per cent worth almost a million dollars. These programs provided rebates to Northerners who purchased energy-efficient products such as wood stoves, LED lightbulbs and ENERGY STAR-certified appliances. They also provided rebates to communities that install renewable energy systems and support community energy plan implementation, and made it possible to run a program to help lower-income homeowners make energy efficiency upgrades. Mr. Speaker, the GNWT continues to lead by example in energy conservation and efficiency, by upgrading our own facilities through the Capital Asset Retrofit Fund. Last year, energy efficiency projects were funded including the Inuvik Hospital, Angik School in Paulatuk, and four schools in Hay River. Last year, these and other initiatives under the Capital Asset Retrofit Fund reduced greenhouse gas emissions by almost 15 thousand tonnes and saved the GNWT almost four million dollars. As part of this government’s long-term vision for our territories energy systems, the GNWT is currently upgrading both its hydro systems. At Snare Forks, a total overhaul of the generating unit was undertaken, and although delayed by COVID, work is scheduled to be completed before the end of 2020. The Taltson overhaul was also delayed by COVID, but the facility underwent its annual maintenance shutdown last summer. During the shutdown, equipment assessments were completed to firm up design, manufacturing and procurement details for the major overhaul. Parts are scheduled to arrive in 2021, with the overhaul scheduled for 2022. Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the initiatives that demonstrate our government’s ongoing efforts – in conjunction with the Government of Canada, Indigenous and community governments, the AEA, and the Northwest Territories Power Corporation – to ensure residents, business and industry have access to secure and affordable energy, as we transition to a strong, healthy economy that is less dependent on fossil fuels.  The GNWT’s annual Energy Initiatives Report, which will be released this fall, provides a full overview of last year’s energy initiatives.  Quana, Mr. Speaker."

I would like to begin with an update on the presumptive tests received by two people in Yellowknife.  Both individuals are part of the same household. One had traveled, while one had not. All isolation protocols seem to have been followed. The individual who had traveled isolated. The individual who had not traveled kept their distance in the home. And they isolated as soon as the other individual developed symptoms as-required.  But unfortunately, the individual who had not traveled still contracted COVID-19, and there are some contacts we are contacting, and getting the advice they need.  We do need to provide public notification of one location because we have identified as having some exposure risk.  If you were at Anytime Fitness in Yellowknife on October 12 between and 3 and 4:30pm, you must self-isolate at home for the next 14 days.  Those you live with must also self-isolate for 14 days.  During this period, you must self-monitor for symptoms closely. If you develop any of the following symptoms, no matter how mild, we are asking you contact the Yellowknife Public Health Unit to be assessed.  Fever New or worsening cough Shortness of breath Malaise (generally feeling unwell) Muscle aches Fatigue Sore throat Runny nose Headache Diarrhea Vomiting Loss of sense of smell or taste Loss of appetite If you are experiencing shortness of breath at-rest, call 9-1-1 - and let them know you may have had an exposure to COVID-19.  I would like to stress that a public notice is not abnormal. We provide these notices not because we believe there is a high-risk, but because there is some risk.  We are ready to test those who develop symptoms quickly, and provide the right advice. We have expanded our drive-thru testing hours in Yellowknife this weekend from 12-4pm on Saturday and Sunday.  If you do not have symptoms, you do not need to get tested. Isolating at home will keep you and others safe.  This is a standard situation in public health. And we have shown we are ready to manage these events during this pandemic.  There were seventy contact associated with the first confirmed COVID-19 case. This was before our travel restrictions and isolation protocols were implemented.  By moving quickly, we kept our communities safe, and avoided an outbreak. We will take every necessary step in this case once again. And I want to assure residents across our territory that today, we are safe.  We allow isolation in a household with others so long as no one has symptoms, and as long as physical distancing measures and enhanced cleaning procedures are followed, because pandemic response is all about balance.  We are in a low-prevalence environment. The additional disruption of locking everyone in a household down because one had traveled keeps people from essential elements in their lives, and may cause undue social and mental harm.  In every decision we make, we weigh the potential harms, with the protective value of public health measures, and the risk of the virus itself.  And if the situation changes, we will always revisit our guidance – because we need to be nimble and adapt in the face of a virus like COVID-19.  The presumptive test we received in Inuvik has been thoroughly investigated. We have identified no contacts, and have determined there is no exposure risk to any communities along the route traveled.  These three presumptive tests has been sent to a partner public health laboratory in Alberta for confirmation. This is required because the new devices which have decreased our turnaround times have been validated for negative tests, but have not yet been validated for positive tests.  This is simply because there have not been many positive tests up here. But as far as public health, it is not material because we treat any presumptive positive test as though it has been confirmed.  We will update the public when we have received confirmatory results. We are hoping they are back by Saturday.  I know many are wondering whether this will mean a change in our public health orders, or whether we are considering transitioning to an earlier phase.  Our best judgement is that this situation is manageable, and there is no need to alter our overarching approach at this time.  We will continue to monitor the situation and update if there are any changes.  I want to finish by echoing Minister Green’s comments. While prioritizing physical distancing, wearing a mask when it’s tough, hand-washing, keeping crowds small and spaces large, and sticking to isolation when required may not be exciting, they are fundamental steps to keeping each other safe.  We get to control whether we take these steps. It does not depend on others. Even if others choose not to take precautions, we can still take them ourselves. And we know they work.  So let’s all do our part as we weather this pandemic together. "
448,2020-10-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/julie-green-presumptive-cases-covid-19,Government Website,Julie Green: Presumptive Cases of COVID 19 ,"Check against delivery    Good afternoon.  First, I’d like to acknowledge that those residents who received the presumptive positive COVID-19 tests are recovering with close monitoring from public health. Our thoughts are with them.  We recognize that we are not immune to COVID-19 in the NWT.  That is why we have worked hard over the past several months to build capacity to manage the risk and be as responsive as possible when we have positive cases.  Our work to build testing and contact tracing capacity means we are able to get results faster and begin the investigations quickly and efficiently. Our health care system has a solid plan to respond to positive cases in all communities across the territory.  We are ready to respond to cases when they arrive.  We know that our fundamental public health measures minimize the risk of outbreaks. Our system is responding to keep our communities safe. We know more about this virus than we ever have.  And we know what precautions work. It comes down to those basics we’ve stressed for months.   Prioritize physical distance of at least six feet wherever you are – and wear a non-medical mask whenever that’s difficult.  Keep crowds small and spaces large. It will keep everyone safer.  Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or sanitizer.  Practice safe respiratory practices when coughing or sneezing.  And please self-isolate when required. It is the most important thing you can do to prevent outbreaks.  Across the country, cases are rising and the risk of this virus is real. We need to remain vigilant in our efforts to keep our residents as safe as possible. It is important to remember that we will not be risk-free until there are effective, widely-available treatments or vaccines. I want to encourage everyone to do their part as we continue to rise to this challenge – just as we have over the past seven months.  I would now like to ask Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Andy Delli-Pizzi to give a brief update.  "
449,2020-10-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-presumptive-cases-covid-19,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Presumptive Cases of COVID 19,"Check against delivery    Good afternoon, and thank you for being here today.  As you are aware, the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer announced three presumptive cases today – one case in Inuvik, and two cases in Yellowknife.  When the pandemic began, we made quick decisions about how we were going to protect residents and our communities from a possible outbreak. We declared a public health emergency; we restricted travel; we required self-isolation planning; and we put restrictions on businesses and people as our first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed.   We stood up contact centres like Protect NWT and 8-1-1; placed border staff at airports and highways and enforcement officers across our regions; and we established safe space for isolation in communities with enhanced medical care. The health and safety of NWT residents and communities was, and still is, our biggest priority. And those decisions paid off.  Our communities were kept safe from COVID-19, and we have experienced no loss of life. The second wave that was anticipated by health officials across Canada in the early days of the pandemic, is here. Southern Canada is seeing record levels of cases, and it was inevitable that we would eventually see new cases in the Northwest Territories. What I want to say is this: the measures we put in place at the beginning of the pandemic are only going to be effective if everyone does their part. It’s critical for residents and communities to remain as diligent as ever before. The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to protecting you.     I know that the measures we have in place have been difficult for everyone – but it’s important to remember, that we are all in this together. We must look out for one another, and take care of those around us.   Northerners are resilient, and when faced with difficult challenges, we always find a way to persevere. I am confident that we will continue to adapt to the pandemic to ensure we are protecting the health and safety of our residents and communities.  Stay safe, and stay positive.  I’d now like to turn the mic over to Minister Green.   "
450,2020-10-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-fiscal-update,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Fiscal Update,"Check against delivery    I rise today to provide a fiscal update but in doing so, I want also to speak about one of the most valuable economic resources that exists across the whole of the Northwest Territories: resiliency.  The world remains in the grip of a pandemic the likes of which few people alive in the world today have any reference point to. Canada is currently experiencing a second wave. In the NWT we are fortunate that since the start of the pandemic, we have been able to limit the cases of COVID-19 that have entered our borders, but that comes with a cost; travel within the territory remains tightly restricted and, as a result, many sectors of our economy continue to be seriously impacted. This follows on several months of lockdown or near lock down earlier this spring.  I venture that no household in the NWT is untouched by the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, there is likely no business or industry that has not faced or does not continue to face, financial or human resource challenges. Many households, businesses, employers and employees are stressed, scared or both. That is the reality of the times we are in.  Mr. Speaker, the Northwest Territories has a strong history of resiliency. The climate is harsh, but people have thrived here since time immemorial. Costs of living are high, but people come and grow their families here. The cost of doing business is high and yet we do continue to attract investment.  A lot has changed since the Budget Speech in February. Budget 2020 spoke to the importance of working within our means by finding internal efficiencies and using creativity and innovation to deliver our mandate priorities even in a time of slow economic growth.  The need for innovation and creativity is more pressing than ever but in the current context, we must start from a place of resiliency to put innovation and creativity to the test.  Despite all of the pandemic-related upheaval, the core values we are using to deliver fiscal responsibility to the NWT have not changed; we will still work within our means to deliver not only on the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly but also to ensure that people and communities across the territory are healthy and safe. We continue to seek creative solutions to these wholly unexpected challenges.  We strive to strike a balance between all of the many diverse needs that exist.  Fortunately, we will start with some good news: signs of an economic recovery are appearing. Our job market has recouped many of the resident jobs lost, the labour participation rate has climbed back to its March level and the employment rate has partially recovered. Retail sales are rebounding, with the Northwest Territories outperforming the provinces so far this year, and this consumer spending is supported by stable and high average weekly earnings. We are painfully aware of sectors in the economy that are still in serious hardship but are cautiously optimistic that we will have a 90 per cent job recovery to pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar year.  Our own revenues will drop this year. We are forecasting significant corporate income tax and resource revenue declines as the events of 2020 will likely continue to some degree through 2021 and work their way through the economy. It is simply not possible to give direct financial support to every person or business in need, all at the same time. But from the earliest days of the pandemic, we made efforts to immediately support NWT people, businesses and communities by waiving a number of revenues, including airport fees, bridge tolls, and leases which will result in a decrease in projected revenues.  Despite these revenue losses, our fiscal situation remains stable thanks in large part to two facts: we have received $92 million in immediate and very welcomed support from the Government of Canada to address the expenditure challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; and, in addition Territorial Formula Financing provides a mainstay of fiscal support that will respond to current own source revenue losses in future years. As a result of the new federal support we are currently projecting this fiscal year’s total revenues to be $2.2 billion, $38 million more than estimated in the 2020-2021 Budget.   That said, the pandemic has driven expenditures significantly higher as we implement measures to protect NWT residents and provide economic support. In total, we estimate $175 million in new expenditures for emergency measures including additional health care costs, income assistance, and other various forms of economic relief and supports for people, businesses and communities. To better sustain our delivery of the crucial programs and services we have implemented to protect the territory from COVID-19, we are proposing this sitting to bring these existing functions together under a COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat that will help us better meet demand, ensure more efficient use of the GNWT’s fiscal resources and provide a clearer point of accountability for the ongoing implementation of the public health orders. With respect to COVID-19 costs, the Department of Finance will publish cost information on its website to maximize transparency. Regardless of how we deliver the pandemic-driven activities, all these expenditures will have a material impact on our fiscal bottom line. We are planning for the worst while hoping for the best and are including the projected costs at $175 million by the end of this fiscal year in our updated forecast for this year. Even within this, we have tried to find efficiencies and innovative delivery methods, and to strike a balance between all the many needs created or contributed to by the realities of the pandemic. This response includes moving $31.7 million that would otherwise be spent across departments into the COVID-19 Secretariat as a single-point of accountability and administration; $72 million for other related health care costs such as testing and supporting health care system capacity; and $72 million for economic supports, including the foregone revenues. Taking the $92 million in direct federal support into account, the projected net effect of the COVID-related costs is expected to be $83 million.  Although these high costs are not good news, the GNWT has a track record of fiscal responsibility as demonstrated again this summer when Moody’s Investors Service confirmed our Aa1 credit rating for the 14th consecutive year. Past financial responsibility will help us weather the pandemic’s revenue and expenditure shocks in our medium-term fiscal outlook. We are committed to continuing on this track.  This commitment will require work. Our latest medium-term outlook projects a course which if not adjusted, results in both an operating deficit in three years and exceeding the new borrowing limit. Despite a $1.8 billion borrowing limit, our current path will start the next Legislative Assembly in violation of that limit. Resilience is not an accident; it can be consciously sought and developed through diligent effort.  We are paying for our COVID-19 pandemic response by shrinking our operating surplus, not by increasing debt or increasing taxes. The 2020-2021 operating surplus is projected to narrow a full $143 million from the February 2020-2021 Budget to $60 million. This reduced position could impact our longer-term fiscal sustainably. But it is a response that should allow for short-term cushioning and as a result, hopefully, more long-term resilience within our private sector.  The lower operating surplus will also increase our total debt to a projected $1.262 billion by the end of this fiscal year. Had we not successfully negotiated a $500 million increase to the federally imposed borrowing limit, this level would have been unacceptably close to the previous limit. Although the new $1.8 billion limit will provide $538 million in borrowing capacity at year-end, we need to be conscious of the risks of carrying too much debt. COVID-19 is not an excuse; we must focus on the difficult choices we need to make to live within our means, while providing the programs and services that Northwest Territories residents need, especially within the context of COVID-19.    During the Budget Dialogues I held over the summer, we heard loud and clear that spending reductions are preferred over tax increases. By themselves, increasing revenues will not be sufficient and is frankly unlikely to be fruitful in the short term as the pandemic continues to impact markets across Canada and the world, continued borrowing will be fiscally unsustainable, and letting capital assets deteriorate by starving the capital budget is unacacceptable. The reality is that expenditure management will need to be the main pillar in moving the GNWT onto a sustainable fiscal path. I want to be very clear: expenditure management is not the same as expenditure reduction. Budget Dialogues participants gave considered suggestions for better expenditure management to improve our efficiency and find more value for our dollar. Now is the time to be creative and innovative; there is a path forward that will allow us to budget in a way that reflects the values and priorities of the people of the NWT. That will be our fiscal path.  Last, during the Budget Dialogues, I also heard many thoughtful comments from people making the connections between health and productivity; between education and labour market participation; and between economic growth and government revenue growth. I believe underlying much of what we heard is evidence that we are truly pulling together as a territory. This energizes me with optimism that as we show resiliency, we will re-build and provide a legacy for the future to realize the great potential that this territory offers.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

When I delivered my first sessional statement in this House last December, no one could have predicted what the future was going to hold. This pandemic has been like nothing many of us have ever experienced. Over 37 million people worldwide have contracted COVID-19, and over a million people have died since the pandemic started.  More than 9,000 Canadians have lost their lives to this virus in less than a year. Every country, community and family is being impacted by COVID-19.  In Canada, provinces and territories grappled with how best to contain the spread of the virus. All jurisdictions took immediate steps to protect the health and well-being of residents in the face of a challenge we are still learning about. In the early days, our efforts were swift. Our government responded to the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer and made protecting the health and well-being of residents and our communities a top priority. We implemented travel restrictions, launched ProtectNWT and 811, established border controls and isolation centres. We invested millions in personal protective equipment for both health and non-health workers, testing and contact testing, and ensuring the health care system was equipped to handle an increase in cases.  Mr. Speaker, our early interventions have paid off. Residents of the NWT have been safe; our communities have not experienced loss of life as a result of this virus; and our biggest risks are being managed. Like Atlantic Canada and other territories who implemented strict controls, we were able to limit COVID-19 in the NWT.  It is important to mention that our success in maintaining the low numbers would not have been possible without the collective support of all of us. Indigenous and community governments who supported our measures: MLAs, the media and community leaders who helped spread the messaging; mines, private enterprise and non-governmental sectors who put the lives of residents first, the many individual employees in various sectors putting their own lives on the line to help, and all the residents who abided by the Chief Public Health Officer orders were all critical to keep our numbers where they are today.    Mr. Speaker, the measures the Government of the Northwest Territories took however, did not materialize on their own.  Hundreds of public service workers stepped up to help in our efforts. Over 180 employees helped on the front lines, but behind this hundreds more within departments helped with the organization, policy development, and implementation of our COVID-19 response.  Our employees are the backbone of this government and their dedication showed as they worked tirelessly to ensure our response was as effective as possible.  I am extremely proud of our civil service and I sincerely thank them for all their hard work.   Parts of the South have recently announced they have entered their second wave and the number of cases in Canada is increasing to levels we haven’t seen since the early days of the pandemic.  While our response to the initial outbreak of COVID-19 was successful to prepare for the second wave, we have to use what we have learned from what we experienced. One of the things we learnt was that having necessary resources housed in multiple departments was challenging.  Many of the requests and enquiries involved various departments which sometimes resulted in less than timely responses.  We also heard that, as much as possible, people want the supports provided by the GNWT pre-pandemic.  As well, we heard that our employees and departments were stretched thin trying to help with the pandemic response and doing the best they could to complete their normal work duties.   Keeping NWT residents safe during the ongoing pandemic continues to be our priority, and it is why we proposed the COVID Secretariat.  The Secretariat will house the border patrols and enforcement team, isolation units, distribution of personal protective equipment to non-health care providers, 811 and ProtectNWT.  The Secretariat will focus on the COVID response which enables departments to focus on service delivery and implementing our mandate commitments.   Mr. Speaker, as was stated by the Governor-General during the Speech from the Throne recently, the last six months have laid bare the gaps in our society.  As well as implementing the controls to enforce the Chief Public Health Officer orders we have also provided supports for residents and businesses to help during this pandemic.  We invested in child care for returning workers, and financially supported our municipalities and Indigenous communities.  We provided supports for businesses, employers, schools, students and income assistance participants. As well, we invested millions in support of our most vulnerable members of our communities.  Our response to COVID-19 will cost money, real money.  But as one Indigenous leader reminded me, “how much money is one life worth”?   The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on our territory and economy, and has created new challenges for pursuing the GNWT priorities. Recovery is key, and we need to ensure our people have jobs and our businesses are thriving.  We also have to keep health and safety, housing, food security, and education, top of mind to improve the lives of all NWT residents.  Now more than ever before, we need to be investing in our people, and support them through this challenging time. We know this will cost money and we cannot do this alone.  We have been meeting regularly with other jurisdictions and the federal government throughout this pandemic.  Canada recognizes our unique realities, and the recent Speech from the Throne identified the exceptional needs of the North.  We will continue to work with all governments to ensure that when we talk economic recovery, investment in housing, transportation, broadband, energy infrastructure and protecting the most vulnerable, the North continues to be recognized as needing special consideration.    We need to close the gap between Northern and Southern Canada, one that existed long before COVID-19. Canada’s commitment to ensuring people aren’t left behind aligns with the priorities outlined in our mandate to ensure a prosperous territory where our residents can thrive for generations to come. That’s why, Mr. Speaker, we need to get on with the business of government. The COVID-19 pandemic is not going to end in the immediate future. While we must ensure we keep the health and well-being of residents at the forefront we cannot lose sight of the work we were all elected to do by residents of the Northwest Territories.  Mr. Speaker, our relationship with Canada is critical to our success as a territory. This morning, alongside Indigenous leaders, the YWCA, and Member of Parliament Michael McLeod, Minister Chinna and I met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a roundtable discussion on Northern housing needs. This issue is important to our government, and we hope this meeting has kicked off a broader discussion for how we can find innovative ways to address the dire need for housing in the NWT. This is an example of our commitment to building strong, collaborative relationships with our stakeholders, Mr. Speaker, and we will continue to find ways to work with Canada, Indigenous and community government partners, and the NGO sector to improve the lives of our residents.  We must continue to work towards a strong north and a resilient economy. As we move forward we will continue to pursue economic and social opportunities that provide sustainable benefits, as well as address the direct impacts of climate change that our territory is experiencing. We need to advance our long-term priorities, particularly when it comes to growing our economy, and ensuring a healthy, vibrant, and educated territory for years to come. Of critical importance as well, we must continue to work with Indigenous governments to conclude negotiations, define the implementation of the United Nation’s Declaration of Indigenous People, and work with the federal government in the development of a National Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls Action Plan. COVID-19 certainly has taken the focus of this government, however departments have still made progress towards meeting our mandate objectives and I’m confident we will be able to complete a number of our mandate areas this term.  During the February 2021 sitting we will document in detail the progress we have made on our mandate commitments.  Mr. Speaker, it was just over one year ago that we were all elected as the 19 MLAs to represent the people of the Northwest Territories. Who knew when we began that we would face challenges like no other government.  Because of the seriousness of this pandemic and the needs of our residents, it is essential that we all work together.  It is critical that Ministers and MLAs work together, along with Indigenous and community governments, businesses, non-government organizations, and residents, to find solutions that ensure the future prosperity of the Northwest Territories.   By working together on areas of shared priorities, we will advance our objectives and better serve the people of the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, we must move forward collectively and collaboratively. We have no choice. The safety of our residents and future of the Northwest Territories depends on it, and by working together I am confident we can achieve success as the 19th Legislative Assembly.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

This resource can be accessed online and is flexible to accommodate a distance learning context.  The resource was made to match the Grade 4 Social Studies curriculum and includes carefully curated readings, songs, photos, stories, and videos throughout. It can be used in its entirety or by incorporating select stops along the journey.  Although the resource is offered at a Grade 4 learning level, it can be a useful and educational resource for a variety of ages including adults.  An accompanying student journal filled with thought-provoking writing prompts and reflective questions helps students strengthen understanding.  Furthermore, the teacher’s guide includes suggestions for inquiry-based projects and a variety of extended learning opportunities, many of which could be adjusted for students to complete while continuing their schooling from home. This project was first created as a master’s thesis design study by Michelle Swallow, the author of The Mackenzie River Guide – A Paddler’s Guide to Canada’s Longest River.  The interactive resource was then collaboratively refined and expanded with beautiful new visual elements and text designed and created by Indigenous employees: Sadetło Scott, Emily Sabourin, and Nikita Hehn who joined the Department of Education, Culture and Employment as part of the summer student and internship program, under the guidance of other ECE staff.   Quote “We are proud to release a new teaching resource that is culturally relevant to the North. Through this virtual journey, students will learn about the land, customs, languages and traditions that carry the identity of our northern cultures and ways of life. It is important that we continue to include NWT narratives in the delivery of education in the territory.” -R.J.

Until this requirement comes into effect, the public is still encouraged to wear masks within our airport facilities.  As passenger traffic continues to increase, this requirement will help keep travellers and employees safe amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Travellers are already required to wear a mask while going through security and/or to board a flight. This Transport Canada regulation came into effect on April 20, 2020.  Travellers are responsible for ensuring they are in compliance with the federal government measures prior to travelling. The public is encouraged to bring their own mask; however, if an individual does not have their own mask, there may be some available for use at our airports. You will not be required to wear a mask if you have medical reasons that make it unsafe for you. The following other exemptions also apply: ·       Individuals unable to remove their mask without assistance. ·       Children under the age of two.  ·       Individuals authorized by security, airline staff or airport staff to remove their mask for identification purposes.  ·       Individuals will be allowed to temporarily remove their mask to eat, drink or take oral medications. The use of a mask is recommended by the Chief Public Health Officer as a way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to protect others. It is especially recommended when it is not possible to consistently maintain a two-metre physical distance from others, particularly in public settings such as airports. Wearing a mask does not replace other protective measures including physical distancing, hand washing, covering a cough or sneeze, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, self-monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms, and staying home when sick.  A reminder that until further notice, only passengers, employees and service staff are permitted inside Northwest Territories’ airports.

The guidelines provide “must-do’s” based on continued public health orders in the territory; things to avoid; and best practices to stay safe for trick-or-treaters and treat-givers.    Key guidance on trick-or-treating includes:  ·       Trick-or-treat in outdoor spaces as much as possible.  ·       Wash your hands often. This is especially important: o   before and after handling your non-medical mask or face covering; o   after touching frequently touched surfaces (i.e., door bells); o   when you arrive home from trick-or-treating; and  o   before and after handling or eating treats. Keep your trick-or-treating partners to your household and Friendship Circle – the five people you like to spend time with most.    Keep interactions brief at homes when getting treats. When approaching houses, take turns one at a time at the door and stay six feet or two metres from others.  ·       Keep mittens on the whole time you trick or treat. Once home, wash mittens and costumes. Wash your hands for 20 seconds. Do not touch your face with the mittens. Haunted houses are challenging settings during a pandemic. This activity requires extra work as haunted houses are made for screaming – and screaming produces a lot of respiratory droplets. That comes with much greater risk than trick-or-treating.    Things to consider for haunted houses:  ·       Holding outdoors is always best: If an open-air setting is possible, it will be safer ·       Allowing for physical distancing: try using glow-in-the-dark physical distancing markers on the floor/ground to keep people at-least two metres (six feet) apart. If it’s possible, it would be better to do four metres. Bigger spaces are always best.  ·       Have a sign-in sheet: keep track of everyone who comes with contact information in case contact tracing is required. ·       Patrons, staff/volunteers use of non-medical masks: requiring non-medical masks will help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling a long distance.  ·       You must control crowds: No more than 25 people can be indoors – and physical distancing must be maintained. Proprietors are responsible.  ·       Hand-washing supplies are a must: Keep them on-site and stocked, and encourage guests to wash their hands frequently.  ·       Have people go through by household wherever possible: Less mixing is always better.   Residents are reminded that anyone who is required to self-isolate for any reason will not be able to participate in:  ·       Trick-or-treating ·       Treat-giving ·       Haunted houses ·       Gatherings of any kind   Full guidelines are available on the GNWT’s COVID-19 response website (link below), including a print-ready document.    Quote(s) “The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenging time, especially when it has created barriers to social interaction, particularly for young people in the NWT. Being able to celebrate Halloween is important for our territory’s social and mental well-being. While Halloween will look a little bit different this year, I know our territory is resilient and creative and I look forward to seeing how families, friends, and especially kids bring that creativity to life, while keeping each other safe during our first pandemic Halloween.”  - Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services     Quick facts ·       Trick-or-treating done outside is a generally low-risk activity so long as the right precautions are taken.  ·       If any plans require gathering limits under Emerging Wisely to be exceeded, a plan to mitigate risk must be submitted to Protect NWT for approval by the Chief Public Health Officer.  ·       Gatherings where many different people mix are a significant source of recent outbreaks across Canada. The Halloween guidelines are designed to help limit these risks – but there will never be no risk.

467,2020-10-06,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/nwt-experiences-lower-usual-wildfire-season-2020,Government Website,NWT experiences lower than usual wildfire season in 2020,"A below-average fire season saw 70 wildfires burn 21,139 hectares across the Northwest Territories (NWT) in 2020—less than half as many fires as last year, and only a fifth of the area burned in 2019. Wet weather limited the number of fires and the area burned, with most regions of the NWT experiencing more rain than forecasted. The only exceptions were the Beaufort-Delta and the North Slave regions, which experienced higher than average fire risk throughout the fire season.  The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) made several adjustments to its fire operations in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Training and fitness testing were modified to limit group sizes and potential exposure, an additional air tanker group and more fire fighters were hired, an ignition task team was established and detection efforts were increased. While fire is a natural and important part of the ecosystem, keeping fires small was a priority this year. Due to the risk of COVID-19, it was critical to avoid large-scale suppression efforts that could require the GNWT call on southern firefighters for support or require the evacuation of small communities. We focused on providing an early and aggressive response to all wildfires. As a result, nearly two thirds of all fires were fought this year—twice as many as usual. The GNWT would like to acknowledge the extra efforts of wildfire personnel during COVID-19 to protect the health and safety of our fire crews and communities. Wildfire staff continue to monitor the fire environment and have already begun planning and preparations for the 2021 wildfire season.   Quote “This year’s wildfire season came with a number of unique challenges. Staff worked very hard to prepare for what I’m almost certain was our first fire season in the middle of a global pandemic. Luckily, our wet summer kept the number of fires low, allowing our crews to focus on early detection and response. Thank you to everyone who helped to keep our territory safe this year.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources    Quick facts   NWT wildfires 2020 2019 10-yr. average (2010-2020) Total number of fires 70 149 209 Total area burned (ha) 21,139 111,098 653,000   Wildfires are a natural part of Northwest Territories ecosystems. Without fire, our forests would not be able to fully regenerate and fuel would build up on the landscape, making future fires more severe and harder to control. The decision to fight a wildfire or to leave it to burn out naturally may depend on the location of the fire, availability of resources, fire behaviour and the potential to affect values at risk, The GNWT actioned 58 per cent of all wildfires in 2020, compared to 29 per cent normally actioned.  More than 129 individuals were trained as firefighters across all five regions in 2020 (41 as extra fire fighters).  Almost all firefighting services were provided by northern businesses (22 fire crews were provided by 10 Indigenous companies and seven long-term aviation contracts were held by four northern companies).

The first shipments of the season departed Hay River on July 10, 2020 and the last delivery took place on September 19, 2020. A total of 27.9 million litres of fuel and 2,720 tons of cargo were successfully delivered to the following locations:  Aklavik Norman Wells Łutsel K'e  Tulita K’asho Got’ine  Inuvik Tuktoyaktuk Ulukhaktok Sachs Harbour Paulatuk   MTS overcame the challenges to navigation posed by record high water levels on Great Slave Lake and the Mackenzie River, and the imposition of strict mitigation measures for COVID-19. A total of 171 people were employed during the peak of the 2020 sailing season, including 9 graduates of the Marine Training Centre in Hay River.  These employment and training opportunities positively impact families and communities and support the long-term sustainability of the marine industry in the north.   This sailing season also included the arrival of four new double-hulled barges, which have already entered service.   Quote “Four years after the launch of Marine Transportation Services, we continue to improve our capacity to operate a reliable and professional marine shipping service.

476,2020-09-30,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/orange-shirt-day-and-residential-school-legacy,Government Website,Orange Shirt Day and the Residential School legacy,"Premier Caroline Cochrane issued the following statement on Orange Shirt Day and the legacy of the Residential School system: Phyllis Jack Webstat was six years old when she went to residential school in Mission, B.C. She lived with her grandmother who didn’t have very much money. Her grandmother spent what little she had to buy Phyllis a new outfit for school, one she got to pick out on her own.  She picked out an Orange shirt with string laces in the front. It made her excited to be going to school. When she arrived on her first day, they took her clothes and she never got to wear that orange shirt again. The colour orange reminds Phyllis of how her feelings didn’t matter, how no cared about her and her worth.  In the Northwest Territories, most of us know someone who attended a residential school, and we have all felt the impact of the legacy it left, and will for generations to come.  Orange Shirt Day is about respecting the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry Calls to Justice, to make right the decades of colonial oppression against Indigenous people across Canada because of the residential school system.  It’s not only about that: this day is about standing with survivors, and committing ourselves to meaningful reconciliation. It’s our duty to ensure we support healing, respect the rights of Indigenous people, and work towards a future where Indigenous languages and cultures are able to thrive.  The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to working with and respecting the rights of Indigenous governments, and ensuring we remain partners as we move forward with reconciliation. As part of our mandate, we will work with Indigenous governments to create and implement an action plan to implement the principles set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and work to settle all outstanding land claims in the NWT.  The future health and prosperity of the Northwest Territories depends our ability to do this work to advance reconciliation, recognize and affirm Aboriginal and treaty rights, support program and service delivery by Indigenous governments, and set the stage for further economic development in the NWT. On behalf of Cabinet, I encourage everyone to wear Orange today and stand with the right side of history as we work to right the wrongs of the past and blaze a new path forward. "

The extension of the Public Health Emergency is necessary in order to respond decisively to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.    Reminders to NWT residents:  The GNWT is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT remains restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. It is an offense to travel within the NWT without an exemption under the Public Health Orders. Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions – no matter how long your trip out of the territory is. Self-isolation is the frontline of our COVID-19 defence. If you’re required to self-isolate, do your part and stick to the self-isolation plan. By keeping physical distance of two metres, keeping our circles and gatherings small, washing our hands, keeping our coughs and sneezes to ourselves, and wearing non-medical masks when it’s difficult to keep physical distance will help keep everyone safer by preventing cases from becoming outbreaks.   Recent COVID-19 NWT Updates:  Rapid testing expansion has resulted in considerable improvement in testing return times. Work is continuing on increasing capacity further over the coming weeks.  Equipment required for a full-scale-up of wastewater surveillance for roughly half the NWT’s population is expected to arrive in the coming week-and-a-half. Installation and ramp-up will begin shortly after.    Strong and Stable Together: As the COVID-19 has accelerated across Canada, some provinces are talking about locking down again. The NWT is in a position where we are looking at how to move forward faster with careful considerations of risk because of strong, early response.  Wherever there are challenging outbreaks and community spread, business and society are both challenged.

While a sales tax is one common way that governments raise revenues to fund the delivery of important programs and services, the GNWT believes that the introduction of a sales tax at this time would lead to an increase in the cost of living to NWT residents that would likely offset potential revenue increases and run counter to our efforts to grow the economy,  “Members of the Legislative Assembly had asked me to consider ways in which the GNWT may generate own-source revenues.  A variety of options including taxation were discussed during recent public dialogue on the upcoming GNWT budget. While the idea of a sales tax was not deemed to be worth pursuing at this time, the GNWT will continue to examine its revenue and spending options to ensure that we are achieving value for money while continuing to deliver important programs and services to all residents of the Northwest Territories.”"

One of the most comprehensive of its kind, the Agreement between Alberta and the Northwest Territories (NWT) lays the foundation for long-term cooperative management to maintain and protect the ecological integrity of the water flowing across the Alberta-NWT border. It establishes decision-making mechanisms between the jurisdictions and commitments for monitoring of water quantity and quality, as well as biological indicators. Today, the bilateral committee responsible for implementing the Agreement released its annual report, Working Together to Manage Our Shared Waters. The report details activities undertaken from April 2017 to March 2018, including an analysis of 2017 water quality and quantity monitoring data from the Slave and Hay rivers, which did not identify any major concerns.  The third year of the Agreement saw considerable collaboration between the governments of Alberta and the NWT to implement the Bilateral Water Management Agreement. Other highlights include: ·       Completion of two reports summarizing existing information about biological monitoring in the Hay and Slave rivers; ·       Start of a pilot program to monitor benthic macroinvertebrates in the Slave and Hay rivers; ·       Continued surface water quality and quantity monitoring and reporting; ·       Development of a report providing information about groundwater in the North; and ·       A first meeting to establish the Alberta-NWT Traditional Knowledge Working Group   Quotes “Clean and abundant water is essential to the physical, social, cultural and economic well-being of all residents of the Northwest Territories. This Agreement represents a cooperative approach to water management between our two jurisdictions. The information provided in this joint report highlights the collaborative efforts the Northwest Territories and Alberta are making when it comes to managing our shared waters.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources (NWT)   “I am proud of ongoing commitment of both governments to co-operatively manage the shared waters of the Mackenzie River basin. Our joint efforts on several initiatives, such as water monitoring and fish sampling to determine the health of the aquatic environment, will ensure that Canada’s largest river system continues to support environmental, social and economic outcomes in both Alberta and the Northwest Territories.” - Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks (Alberta)    Quick facts ·       The Mackenzie River Basin is the largest river system in Canada. ·       The Alberta-Northwest Territories Mackenzie River Basin Bilateral Water Management Agreement was signed on March 18, 2015. ·       To promote a cooperative approach to water management, the Governments of Canada, Northwest Territories, Yukon, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan signed the Mackenzie River Basin Transboundary Waters Master Agreement in 1997, committing all six governments to work together towards managing shared water resources in a sustainable manner for current and future generations. ·       Bilateral agreements provide a long‐term framework for both upstream and downstream jurisdictions to manage shared water resources and ensure that upstream jurisdictions do not unreasonably harm the aquatic ecosystem of downstream jurisdictions.   Related links ·       Working Together to Manage Our Shared Waters, 2016-2017:  o   Executive Summary  o   Full report ·       Alberta-Northwest Territories Mackenzie River Basin Bilateral Water Management Agreement  ·       Alberta Environment and Parks  ·       Transboundary water agreements – ENR website  ·       NWT water stewardship   For more information, please contact:  Public Affairs and Communications Department of Environment and Natural Resources Government of the Northwest Territories  ENR_Communications@gov.nt.ca"

Mr. Turner cared deeply about Canadians, spending decades as a Cabinet Minister under Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Trudeau with a focus on protecting the most vulnerable of our society. As Justice Minister to Trudeau, he improved rights for the LGBTQ+ community as part of Trudeau’s goal of taking the state out of the bedrooms of the nation. He made provisions in the justice system for legal abortions to take place in hospitals. He lead the efforts to ensure the rights of French Canadians were enshrined in the Officials Languages Act of 1969. In February 1970, he established the Law Reform Commission of Canada, to look at ways to improve the justice system to ensure a more fair and equitable process for all Canadians. He was instrumental in being the first Justice Minister to provide funding for legal aid in Canada, something that was near and dear to his heart. He strongly believed everyone had the right to a fair trial, regardless of his or her socio-economic status.  While his time as Prime Minister was short-lived Mr. Turner’s impact on Canadians cannot be overstated. He has impacted the lives of some of the most vulnerable and marginalized, and paved the way for many who came after him."

These programs reflect the importance of increasing food security through locally-harvested food and are a direct response to the challenges our communities are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Country foods are of critical cultural and social importance to NWT residents, and are an important part of overall wellbeing. Harvesting food from the land can help offset the high cost of living by decreasing reliance on store-bought foods, which have significant cost implications for residents, particularly in remote communities. The programs announced today will also help facilitate the exchange of land-based knowledge and provide training for the next generation of hunters and trappers. Three new programs will offer a total of $330,000 in funding to support harvesters and the traditional economy in 2020-2021. These include: funding to assist families in need to go out on the land a regional harvesting, training and mentorship funding program a pilot program for trapper mentorship These new funding programs will begin accepting applications mid-October. Details and application deadlines will be announced in the coming weeks. In addition, under the Genuine Mackenzie Valley Fur Program, the GNWT has enhanced current grubstake payments this year for eligible trappers in light of COVID-19. A second category of eligibility has been created to make additional funding available to more trappers this year. Grubstake payments are intended to help offset some of the annual start-up costs of trapping and encourage participation in the fur industry.  Changes to the Trapper’s Grubstake Program are effective September 15, 2020 and payments will be made directly to trapper’s accounts.    Quote “In the Northwest Territories, life is tied to the land. Supporting land-based skills and knowledge in our communities is an important part of a prosperous, diverse and sustainable traditional economy, and helps ensure access to safe and quality country foods. It is my hope that this funding will help offset some of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our communities this year, while helping to build resiliency and self-reliance into the future. I look forward to seeing what kinds of opportunities are created through these programs.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources    Quick facts The Department of Environment and Natural Resources administers several funding and support programs to encourage sustainable livelihoods and support the NWT’s traditional economy. This includes six established programs under the Genuine Mackenzie Valley Fur (GMVF) Program to support trappers and harvesters. The GMVF Program is designed to protect NWT trappers and harvesters from market downturns and unexpected events such as the current pandemic. For example, the GNWT provides advances on high quality fur so trappers do not have to wait until auction to receive full payment for their furs. The GNWT provides additional support to harvesters through the Community Harvesters Assistance Program (CHAP). Local Wildlife Committees and Renewable Resource Councils are provided with annual funding to help offset the cost of harvesting activities in their community. The three new programs available this fall will provide additional funding this year for families and new trappers, and provide opportunities for harvesting mentorship, support land-based training needs, and promote harvesting that brings foods into communities. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (ENR) hosts annual regional workshops for trappers to provide information on humane trapping, effective pelt handling, the Fur Harvesters Auction, and species-specific information.

499,2020-09-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/enhancing-safety-nwt-rapid-testing-expansion,Government Website,Enhancing Safety in the NWT - Rapid Testing Expansion,"To enhance the Northwest Territories’ ability to detect and react to COVID-19, the Government of the Northwest Territories has expanded the number of in-territory rapid tests used for COVID-19, and procured additional equipment to expand this capacity further in the coming weeks.  Starting immediately the NWT now can process up to 240 COVID-19 tests per week in-territory. Before this milestone, rapid testing was limited to select, high-priority cases. Careful analysis of current territorial testing supplies has determined this level of testing is sustainable in the NWT. These tests will be processed using the BioFire test platform.  An immediate benefit is that patients can expect to receive their COVID-19 results sooner.   Additional swabs beyond the NWT’s capacity of 240 tests per week will continue to be sent to Alberta for analysis. Should this expanded local testing capacity be exceeded, high priority cases, such as individuals presenting at local healthcare centres with more severe symptoms, will be prioritized for local testing.  Four additional rapid testing units are expected to arrive for installation by the end of this week. Validation will begin immediately and human resource needs are currently being addressed.  It is expected that in the coming weeks, the territory should be able to move comfortably to 500 rapid, in-territory tests per week with further expansions on-the-way as human resource and supply capacity allows.   By increasing our capacity and timeliness of testing, not only will we provide better service to residents, but we will also be better positioned to consider the expansion of testing criteria and potential changes to public health guidance.     The GeneXpert testing platform in Yellowknife and Inuvik will continue to be used for high-priority cases and will complement this expanded capacity.  Expanding rapid in-territory testing is one part of an ongoing expansion of epidemiological surveillance to prepare the NWT for an additional surge in infections of COVID-19.  Expanded local diagnostic testing complements the wastewater testing program announced last week.    Quotes “This is a good first step as we work towards getting the turnaround times we need to rapidly identify and respond to COVID-19 cases in our territory. We will continue our work to expand in-territory testing and put ourselves in a position to deliver on every COVID-19 test within our boundaries.” -Julie Green, Minister of Health and Social Services   “Staff across the NTHSSA has worked hard to ensure COVID-19 testing is easily accessible and results are received as quickly as possible, building in-territory testing capacity is another success in our fight against COVID-19. Residents also have an important role to play, stay safe, keep your distance, wash your hands, wear your masks, and get tested if you have symptoms to keep us all protected.” -Sue Cullen, Chief Executive Officer, NWT Health and Social Services Authority   Quick facts The average number of tests collected weekly across the NWT since the beginning of August is 175. The maximum number of tests collected in the NWT in one week during the pandemic is  478. The health system expects demand for testing will increase in the coming weeks with return to school and the approach of cold and flu season.   Related links Northwest Territories Epidemiology Dashboard Getting Tested for COVID-19   Media contacts  Mike Westwick  Manager, Communications (COVID-19 Response) Health and Social Services  Mike_Westwick@gov.nt.ca    David Maguire Communications Manager Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority David_Maguire@gov.nt.ca "

501,2020-09-15,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/public-health-emergency-extended,Government Website,Public Health Emergency Extended,"Minister of Health and Social Services, Julie Green has extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the advice of Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) Dr. Kami Kandola. The latest extension continues through September 29, 2020.  With record levels of COVID-19 transmission being reported in neighbouring jurisdictions, the risk to the Northwest Territories is increased. The extension of the Public Health Emergency is necessary in order to respond decisively to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Reminders to NWT residents:  The GNWT is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT remains restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. It is an offense to travel within the NWT without an exemption under the Public Health Orders. Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions – no matter how long your trip out of the territory is. Self-isolation is the frontline of our COVID-19 defence. If you’re required to self-isolate, do your part and stick to the self-isolation plan. By keeping physical distance of two metres, keeping our circles and gatherings small, washing our hands, keeping our coughs and sneezes to ourselves, and wearing non-medical masks when it’s difficult to keep physical distance will help keep everyone safer by preventing cases from becoming outbreaks.   Recent COVID-19 NWT Updates:  The territory continues to increase epidemiological surveillance capacity to prepare for the continuing pandemic.  The wastewater surveillance program announced last week is one of the most ambitious in the country – covering roughly half of the territory’s population and 100% of isolation centres. This can provide an early indication of whether COVID-19 is present in the territory, and allow for targeted advice and action.  The wastewater surveillance program will complement an aggressive testing program. Solutions are being finalized for increasing rapid testing capacity in the territory so patients can get results quickly.    All NWT residents, workers and visitors have a responsibility and role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and we must take the necessary steps to protect each other. If that responsibility holds, the Northwest Territories is in a good position to manage this pandemic.

As a result of the increased sediment, many metals associated with silt and clay particles were also found at higher than usual concentrations in both rivers for July. In the Slave River, some concentrations of dissolved metals were also elevated, but most were within the range of what has been measured historically in the rivers. It is normal to see increased metal concentrations due to high water, as particles along the river bed and shores are carried downstream. Under these conditions, nutrients such as phosphorus also accumulate in the suspended sediment. These spikes are observed every spring with snowmelt, and have been amplified this year due to long-lasting high water levels across most of the Mackenzie River Basin, including the Athabasca, Peace, Hay and Liard Rivers. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) monitored water quality in the Slave River during the spring breakup and in both the Hay and Slave Rivers through the summer, with some delays beginning summer sampling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Water quality results for samples collected in August from the Great Slave Lake plume as well as additional samples collected from the Hay and Slave Rivers for the analysis of hydrocarbons and pesticides will be released on the Environment and Natural Resources website as they are available.   Quote “All summer we’ve been seeing extreme high water levels, not just in the Northwest Territories but throughout much of the Mackenzie Basin in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. For example, water levels on the Athabasca River this year are among the highest ever recorded. High water levels have affected water quality. The water quality data being shared by upstream jurisdictions as part of our transboundary agreements can help us get a better understanding of what is happening in our lakes and rivers.”  - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources    Quick facts The GNWT monitors water quality within the NWT, including at transboundary sites on the Slave, Hay, Liard and Peel rivers. Long-term monitoring provides a record of changes over time, and will help detect differences and trends in water quality. Water quality is also measured upstream in Alberta and British Columbia by the provincial and federal governments (Environment and Climate Change Canada). While some water quality monitoring was temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, most has now resumed. An agreement was recently reached with Environment and Climate Change Canada for the GNWT to collect water samples on behalf of ECCC at four important transboundary sites near the Alberta-NWT border (Peace River at Peace Point, Slave River at Fitzgerald, Slave River above the Mouth and Hay River near the Alberta-NWT border). Samples were collected in August and are currently being analyzed. The toxicity of a metal depends on the form in which it occurs. When a metal is attached to sediment in the water, it is less likely to be absorbed by aquatic organisms. Dissolved metals are more likely to affect aquatic organisms. High turbidity in water can interfere with the disinfection process for drinking water. The Department of Health and Social Services issues boil water advisories when there is a risk that microbiological contamination may be present in the water supply. When out on the land, no matter how pristine the water, the water should always be boiled at a rolling boil for at least one complete minute to remove harmful microbes.

506,2020-09-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/wastewater-sampling-form-covid-19-early-warning-system-northwest-territories,Government Website,Wastewater Sampling to Form COVID-19 “Early-Warning” System for Northwest Territories,"YELLOWKNIFE (September 10, 2020) – Regular surveillance to identify the presence or absence of COVID-19 will soon be possible because of a wastewater testing program initiated by the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT).  This program will collect regular samples of wastewater (sewage) from Hay River, Yellowknife, Fort Smith, Inuvik, and Fort Simpson, which will be tested for COVID-19.   It is expected these samples will cover approximately half of the territory’s population. They will also cover 100% of all the isolation centres in Hay River, Fort Smith, Inuvik, and Yellowknife.  This form of surveillance has been found to uncover trends of COVID-19 in the community 4-10 days earlier than clinical data would by detecting the presence of the virus in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic populations.  The presence of COVID-19 in wastewater samples does not necessarily indicate there is active COVID-19 transmission in the community.  However, collecting this information can serve as an early warning system for the territory and help the health and social services system target advice to communities as the pandemic continues.  Initial samples have been collected in Yellowknife and Hay River with implementation in the other three communities beginning in the coming weeks.  The effort will be led by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer in partnership with Municipal and Community Affairs, and Environment and Natural Resources. As a key partner, the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory is providing in-kind testing.  An investment of $100,000 from Indigenous Services Canada allowed the territory to purchase the necessary testing equipment and to coordinate the delivery of this program.  The necessary equipment to begin automatic sampling at regular time intervals is expected to arrive in two-to-three weeks. Initial grab samples are being collected at Yellowknife and Hay River to define processes in the meantime.     Quotes: “Our territory is using every tool at our disposal to prepare for another surge in infections across Canada. Establishing an early-warning system using wastewater samples will allow us to have a much better idea of whether COVID-19 is present in our territory, give communities advice, and get people tested if they need it.”  -Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories   “This innovative early detection initiative will allow the Northwest Territories to learn how wastewater surveillance can play an important role in identifying and preventing further spread of COVID-19 by collaborating with scientists from the Public Health Agency of Canada and assisting their researchers in engaging First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. We must continue to support these initiatives that are essential to prevent, prepare and respond to stop the spread of any potential COVID-19 outbreak.” -The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Indigenous Services   Quick facts:  The Chief Public Health Officer would alert the public regarding positive wastewater results and provide applicable guidance at that time. Upon a positive result, guidance and outreach will be targeted at those in the community who have:  							Arrived in the NWT after travel from outside the territory since the last negative wastewater result; and  Developed symptoms of COVID-19.  The recommendation to get tested for COVID-19 and any other necessary advice will be provided.  This strategy would evolve if community transmission develops.  The presence of COVID-19 in wastewater samples alone will not result in aggressive containment measures as it could be connected to imported travel cases being appropriately isolated.  Public health measures like limits on large-scale gatherings or mandatory masking in indoor public spaces will be considered depending on the strength of the signal.    Related Links:  Canadian Water Network Indigenous Services Canada  GNWT COVID-19 Website    Media contact:  Mike Westwick  Manager, Communications and Public Affairs COVID-19 Coordinating Secretariat Mike_Weswick@gov.nt.ca  "

This collaboration reflects the ongoing commitment by both governments to conduct important water quality monitoring at long-term monitoring stations. The quality of water is important for NWT residents and for the sustainability of the Mackenzie River Basin. Long-term monitoring provides a record of changes over time, and will help detect differences and trends in water quality flowing from Alberta into the NWT. The collaboration between governments will allow for monitoring to resume in Alberta on the Peace River at Peace Point and the Slave River at Fitzgerald. Within the NWT, monitoring will resume at ECCC’s long-term water quality monitoring sites on the Hay River near the Alberta-NWT border and on the Slave River Above the Mouth. Provincial monitoring in Alberta has already resumed, as has long-term federal monitoring at important sites on the Athabasca River. Water quality monitoring in the NWT has continued throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with only slight delay.   Water samples collected will be analyzed at Taiga Environmental Laboratories in Yellowknife and will also be distributed to Government of Canada-designated laboratories for further analysis.   Quotes “As the ultimate downstream jurisdiction in the Mackenzie River Basin, the Northwest Territories relies on a network of long-term monitoring sites to detect changes in the water and potential impacts from activities upstream. Working with Environment and Climate  Change Canada to resume monitoring at these four important sites will help us answer residents’ questions about the health of the water flowing across our border, and help ensure the waters of the Northwest Territories remain clean, abundant and productive for all time.” - Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources    “Canada’s freshwater is one of our most precious natural resources and it deserves protection for present and future generations. Our Government is committed to working with other orders of government to achieve that goal.” - Michael V. McLeod, Member of Parliament for Northwest Territories   Quick facts In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ECCC enacted its Business Continuity Plan in an effort to prioritize the health and safety of the Department’s workforce. Water quality monitoring officers continue to monitor the situation in collaboration with Northwest Territories water quality experts. Resumption of field activities in the region by ECCC is scheduled in September. In the meantime, collaboration with the Northwest Territories has allowed for enhanced water monitoring on important transboundary rivers. Water levels across the Mackenzie River Basin have been among the highest on record in 2020. This is primarily due to high precipitation throughout the basin (both rain and snow melt). Rising and sustained high water levels are expected to have a temporary impact on water quality, as particles along the riverbeds and banks as well as in flooded areas are carried downstream.  Results will be released on the Environment and Natural Resources website as they become available.

As highlighted in the Government Response to the Findings and Recommendations of the Aurora College Foundational Review, the transformation of Aurora College into a polytechnic university represents a significant organizational change that will create a new range of opportunities for prospective students and the territory as a whole. Every post-secondary institution is unique. Areas of specialization help distinguish institutions, their contributions to knowledge, and their scope of learning opportunities. Specializations at any post-secondary education institution evolve over time and what is proposed in this discussion paper is a starting point for ongoing engagements with partners and key stakeholders around the future polytechnic university. Over time, it is anticipated that the polytechnic university will refine and expand these areas of specialization as the needs of Northerners and the NWT evolve. While areas of specialization are a basis for planning for the new polytechnic university, they will increasingly inform many of the improvements to Aurora College made through the transformation process. It is important to note that, while areas of specialization will guide programming decisions and shape their design and delivery, they do not explicitly dictate what programs will be offered. Programming decisions require further engagement and analysis. As part of its ongoing engagement with partners and stakeholders, the GNWT is sharing the Polytechnic University Areas of Teaching and Research Specialization discussion paper with Indigenous Governments, campus communities, industry and other key stakeholders for their input. Those interested in providing input are asked to do so by end of day on September 28, 2020.    Quote “As part of the transformation of Aurora College into a polytechnic university, we are once again taking an active approach to engaging with partners and stakeholders in the early stages of decision-making.

As Western Canada’s rate of infection reaches levels not seen since the beginning of the pandemic, our territory must remain vigilant to protect our communities, and our health system.  The territory is working hard through every avenue to address the challenge of rapid testing supplies.  Solving this problem will provide new options to identify and respond quickly to cases of COVID-19 when they occur in the Northwest Territories. Everyone entering the NWT and those returning, regardless of how long they have been away, is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions. Self-isolation is the frontline of our COVID-19 defence. If you’re required to self-isolate, it is very important to follow your self-isolation plan. By keeping physical distance of two metres, keeping our circles and gatherings small, washing our hands, protecting ourselves and others from coughs and colds, and wearing non-medical masks when it’s difficult to maintain, physical distance will help keep everyone safer by preventing cases from becoming outbreaks. Continued vigilance and responsibility by all is key to responding to COVID-19 risk.  Together, the Northwest Territories can continue to manage this pandemic.

The barges were delivered 381 kilometres outside of Tuktoyaktuk, in a location known as Wise Bay, with no physical interactions or contact with NWT residents as per OCPHO requirements for the NWT. Coordination of their offloading was completed via radio communications only. An open and competitive process was used for the procurement of the barges, with the solicitation period running from December 19, 2018 to February 11, 2019. Nanjing Jinling Shipyard Co. Ltd. (now called China Merchants Jinling Shipyard (Nanjing) Co., Ltd.) was identified as the highest ranked proponent and ultimately awarded the contract. Quote “Currently, fuel is carried to some Northern communities, particularly those along the Mackenzie River watershed, in single-hulled barges. These new double-hulled barges will minimize the risk of a fuel spill and improve the safety of community resupply operations while helping to stabilize the cost of living for our residents.” - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Infrastructure    Quick facts ·       MTS previously had only two double-hulled barges that met regulatory requirements for the transportation of petroleum products on Canadian waterways and oceans. ·       The new barges have the capacity to carry multiple types of petroleum products and deck cargo.  ·      No Northwest Territories businesses participated in the competitive process, nor did any businesses propose that the barges be built in North America.  ·      The $26 million budget for the new barges has been cost-shared between the Government of Canada (75 per cent, or $19.5 million) and the GNWT (25 per cent, or $6.5 million).   Related links ·       Marine Transportation Services ·       Marine Traffic tracker   For media requests, contact:  Public Affairs and Communications Department of Infrastructure Government of the Northwest Territories INF_Communications@gov.nt.ca "

The winning schools will be awarded prizes ranging from $500 – $1,800 in recognition of their activities and creative efforts for the annual awareness campaign.   Some of the highlights from this year’s winners are:   ·       In the South Slave District Education Council region, high school students created a post-apocalyptic scenario in which our water supply was compromised and was the catalyst for the spread of the zombie virus. Students researched and compared possible drinks that would be best for our survival if water wasn't an option. ·       Deh Cho Divisional Education Council students participated in events taught by elders on how to make healthy food from scratch and teachings about the importance of water to maintain their health.  ·       Students and their families in the Beaufort Delta Education Council were challenged to track how much pop they drank in a month with the goal of drinking no pop. ·       Students at the Yellowknife Education District Number 1 (YK#1) formed a partnership with public health nurses and Ecology North to learn about the benefits of drinking tap water.  ·       Yellowknife Catholic Schools participated in a variety of activities that helped promote healthy drinks, traditional activities and healthy snacks. ·       K’alemi Dene School hosted family night which featured healthy food and beverages, and educational games about sugary drinks.   Quote “Congratulations to all winners and participants of this year’s Drop the Pop challenge.

This also ensures that the CSFTNO incurs no prejudice pending the Court of Appeal’s decision.   Quote: “Further review of the recent decision identified several legal issues that warranted the attention of the Court of Appeal. While we are appealing this decision, we are also working together with education bodies to ensure that student’s needs are met. We will achieve this through policy and practice, by establishing clear guidelines for future program requirements”. 						- R.J.

539,2020-08-18,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/public-health-emergency-extended-through-september-1,Government Website,Public Health Emergency Extended Through September 1,"Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom has extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the advice of Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) Dr. Kami Kandola. The latest extension runs through September 1, 2020.  The Public Health Emergency remains necessary in order to respond decisively to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. .  Reintroduction is most likely to occur as a result of travel from locales with community transmission.  The risk to the NWT remains significant as increases in cases in southern Canada continue to grow – particularly within our territory’s closest provincial neighbours.  With self-isolation plans filed reaching more than 900 last week, travel to the territory by returning residents, and others coming to live, work, or study continue to grow.  Additional entries to our territory include those exercising traditional harvesting rights and those servicing supply-chains – though with significant additional precautions when they are here. We remain intimately connected to the rest of Canada, which means public health officials must consider these risks when planning and executing the territory’s response.  The GNWT is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT is restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. It is an offense to travel within the NWT without an exemption under the Public Health Orders. Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions – no matter how long your trip out of the territory is. Self-isolation is the frontline of our COVID-19 defence. If you’re required to self-isolate, do your part and stick to the self-isolation plan.  Taking responsibility for ourselves is crucial. By keeping physical distance of two metres, keeping our circles and gatherings small, washing our hands, keeping our coughs and sneezes to ourselves, and wearing non-medical masks when it’s difficult to keep physical distance will help keep everyone safer by preventing cases from becoming outbreaks.    For more information, visit our website: www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19. www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19/en/services/public-health-orders/emerging-wisely   Media contact: Mike Westwick Manager, Communications (COVID-19 Response) Health and Social Services Mike_Westwick@gov.nt.ca"

Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment released the following statement today regarding the reopening of schools for the 2020-2021 school year:  “Over the past number of months, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment and education bodies have worked hard to create school re-opening plans that will ensure all students in the Northwest Territories (NWT) can continue their education during the upcoming school year. While consideration has been given to the unique circumstance of each community and school, every reopening plan has been developed in accordance with guidelines provided by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO). These guidelines, which are based on the most up to date research from across Canada and around the world, place the utmost importance on protecting students, staff, families, and communities. I am pleased to report that re-opening plans for all 49 schools in the NWT have been reviewed and approved by the OCPHO, and that education bodies have started communicating the details of these plans to students, families and communities.” “I understand that parents, students and teachers will have many questions as we get closer to the first day of school. I want to reassure you that we are working diligently with education bodies and the OCPHO to ensure that school re-opening plans provide an effective learning environment for students while prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of all students, staff and communities.” “The majority of students in the NWT will begin full time, in-person classes in the fall. However, some students will participate in blended learning, which is a combination of in-person and at home education. The reality is that some schools simply do not have enough space within their existing facilities or in their communities to accommodate all students full time while complying with physical distancing requirements mandated by the OCPHO. An extraordinary amount of work and creativity has gone into ensuring as many students as possible will be able to return to schools this fall, and I commend all those involved in achieving this monumental task.” “In order to support the students and teachers participating in blended learning, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment and a number of other departments have been working in collaboration with education bodies to standardize online learning platforms and address gaps in access to technology. This work is being informed by the education system’s recent experience with distance learning.” “Great care has been taken to ensure all school re-opening plans comply with the requirements of the OCPHO and prioritize safety, while still providing an enriched learning environment. That said, there is no doubt that schools will look and feel different this year. We will need to be flexible and responsive, as well as patient and understanding, as we all adjust to a new model of learning.”"

The latest extension runs through August 18, 2020.   The Public Health Emergency remains necessary in order to respond decisively to needs for personal protective equipment, isolation space, enforcement, and travel checkpoints which essential to the territory’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The risk to the NWT remains high as there has been a recent increase in cases in southern Canada. With upwards of 700 new self-isolation plans filed a week, we have a significant amount of people joining us to live, work, or study.  Additional entries to our territory include those exercising traditional harvesting rights and those servicing supply-chains – though with significant additional precautions when they are here.  Reintroduction is most likely to occur as a result of travel from locales with community transmission. Self-isolation protocols and monitored travel are our best defence from these cases growing into outbreaks.  Given compliance is never 100 percent, taking precautions like physical distancing and limiting gatherings, and gradually, safely releasing public health restrictions, are prudent measures for preventing outbreaks from getting out-of-control.  The GNWT is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT is restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. It is an offense to travel within the NWT without an exemption under the Public Health Orders. Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith with few exceptions – no matter how long your trip out of the territory is.

Lack of infrastructure funding is a significant barrier to the development of licensed centre-based early learning and child care programs, as many available buildings do not meet requirements for providing child care and renovations are often very expensive. This new funding helps to support community organizations afford the renovations required to establish early learning and child care programming for their residents. Interested organizations can submit proposals for funding through regional Early Childhood Consultants by August 31, 2020 to be eligible for up to $500,000 in funding for the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Funding priority will be given to communities with limited or non-existent early learning and child care programming.   Quote “The Government of the Northwest Territories committed in its mandate to increasing the availability and affordability of child care in communities.

In these instances, activities were moved from Phase 3 to Phase 2.  The organizations approved were:    Yellowknife Gymnastics Club – all programming for those 19-and-under. Yellowknife Amateur Speed-Skating Association – all programming for those 19-and-under.  Yellowknife Sporting Club Hockey Skills Camp – all programming for those 19-and-under. Minor hockey associations have also been invited to submit their plans for return-to-play in preparation for the upcoming season.    Each of these approvals were based on prudent planning by the organizations incorporating guidance from national associations, rigorous public health risk assessments by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer, and a healthy back-and-forth with organizations to help get them guidance on resuming as safely as possible.    In this way, the process allows for some flexibility – recognizing the value these kinds of activities bring to our communities – while keeping to an evidence-based approach to keeping residents as safe as possible during the pandemic.    A similar process is available to all businesses and organizations in the Northwest Territories – and many have accessed it to increase capacity safely to bring their operations a bit closer to normal.    Quote(s) “As we continue to rise to the challenge of COVID-19, revitalizing our communities safely and as much as possible will remain top-of-mind. It’s one way we’re assuring mental, social, and cultural well-being is not neglected during our response. Our message to our communities: if you believe there are ways to alter activities to make them safer while moving the needle a bit closer to normal, get in touch – our public health professionals are willing to work with you.” -Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services     “Our office assesses each plan and each request for an exception through the same vigorous public health risk assessment methods we used to develop Emerging Wisely. We’ve been pleased to see a lot of creative thinking from organizations to make their environments safer for their clients and staff with smart changes in their standard operations. Moving forward with caution is our best chance to keep communities within our boundaries as open as possible, for as long as possible.” 						-Dr. Kami Kandola, Chief Public Health Officer of the Northwest Territories   Quick facts Since the territory began relaxing restrictions, 34 separate Exceptional Circumstance Exemption approvals have been provided to businesses and organizations to give some more freedom safely.  The territory’s process for re-opening within phases generally does not require interaction with public health – with the key requirement being to keep risk assessments on-file and adhere to their requirements in case of inspection from the Worker’s Safety and Compensation Commission.  If businesses and organizations wish to apply for exceptions under the public health orders – whether to alter activities to bring them back in an earlier phase or to increase capacity based on your individual situation – submit the application to ProtectNWT@gov.nt.ca for consideration as far ahead of time as possible.

Businesses can apply immediately for funding to top up employees’ wages from April to $18/hour. While the intent of the program is to help employees, we are asking businesses to partner with us to deliver the program.    The NWT wage top up program was possible through a federal government contribution of $4.74 million and is intended to assist all lower-wage workers working to keep the economy running while physical distancing measures are in place.   Quote:   “I am pleased with the uptake for this program, but would like to see even more NWT employers apply to take advantage of this program. This extended program is intended to reduce the financial stress of employees who have continued to work since the pandemic began.  Employers can apply to receive funding retroactively to the start of the program, and I encourage all of those employers with applicable employees who have not yet taken the steps to apply for this financial boost to do so.” -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance Quick facts: The wage top-up is a taxable benefit for employees. Businesses will receive $50 per employee from the GNWT to cover the administrative costs of adjusting their employees’ wages for the top-up. Businesses are asked to provide eligible employee hours and wages in a spreadsheet to the email address NWTwagetopup@gov.nt.ca Once applications are approved, the GNWT will issue monthly payments to employers to cover the cost of the top-up, for April 1 to October 3, 2020.

The Aa1 rating is the second highest rating available from Moody’s, and remains one of the highest among provinces and territories.  The rating demonstrates the confidence Moody’s has in the GNWT’s financial management despite revenue and expenditure shocks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The GNWT expects an operating surplus this fiscal year, even with COVID-19 – making the GNWT one of the few provinces or territories with such a positive expected fiscal result. The GNWT has a good base to build upon. A significant portion of GNWT revenues come from federal transfers, at roughly 80 per cent, with various own-source revenues comprising the remainder. This highlights the need to carefully control expenditure growth, since the capacity to raise meaningful additional revenues is limited. While additional costs have been incurred because of COVID-19, the GNWT is working hard to ensure that finances are sustainable. First steps include moving to four-year business planning as part of the budget development process and hosting a pre-budget dialogue over the summer months to gauge residents’ views on how best to position the GNWT’s budgeting priorities in light of the current reality and the need to ensure future fiscal health and sustainability.   Quote “This credit review is a positive reflection on the GNWT’s ability to responsibly manage its budget and expenditures. While COVID-19 has led to additional costs, the GNWT is working hard to ensure that our finances are sustainable and we are implementing a multi-year plan to improve our financial position. I look forward to engaging with residents over the next few weeks to get their input on how best to position the GNWT’s budgeting priorities in light of the impacts the response to COVID-19 has had on our territory.” -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance   Quick Facts A high credit rating supports current borrowing at a low interest rate and helps to ensure affordable borrowing costs for future strategic investments. The Aa1 rating is the second highest credit rating issued by Moody’s. An Aaa rating is judged to be of high quality and is subject to very low credit risk. The GNWT’s Aa1 rating is one of the highest  among Canadian jurisdictions.   Related Links Budget 2020-21 Moody’s Investor Services Budget Dialogues   For more information, please contact:  Todd Sasaki Senior Communications Officer 						Government of the Northwest Territories todd_sasaki@gov.nt.ca 867 767-9168 ext. 15015"

Simpson, announced the extension of all Income Assistance (IA) COVID-19 relief measures currently in place.  Under Income Security Programs, the IA program at the Department of Education, Culture and Employment provides financial assistance to residents, including seniors and persons with disabilities, aged 19 years or older, to assist with their basic and enhanced needs.   In March 2020, the IA program modified its suite of benefits to assist the Northwest Territories’ most vulnerable families and individuals. As the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continued to monitor actions from jurisdictions across Canada, the decision was made to further support the territory’s most vulnerable residents by exempting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) in the calculation of IA benefits.  All IA COVID-19 relief measures will continue to be in place until the end of September 2020, and will be reviewed again at that time. This includes: Exempted the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB).  “Payrolled” all clients so that they do not have to report each month; ensuring they receive their payments consistently, and avoids in-person reporting.  Directed that all clients will engage in only one Productive Choice: taking care of themselves and their families. They are not required to report on this productive choice. Exempted monetary donations from being counted as income in their IA benefits, as of April 2020. These may be in the form of gifts from friends, family, benevolent organizations or Indigenous governments.  Quote “Over the last several months we have made numerous changes to provide further support to the people of the north during these rapidly changing times. I am pleased to announce that we are not only making sure these changes continue, we are enhancing them to better serve our residents.  The last thing we want to do is add any additional stress as residents they keep their families safe and navigate the challenges of this pandemic.”   - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   Quick facts On March 23, all GNWT buildings were closed, and essential employees continued to work with clients and the public by phone and email.  To date, the Income Assistance Program has:  §  Provided a one-time emergency allowance for IA clients registered in March to help them with a 14-day supply of food and cleaning products as the stores have them available. Individuals received $500 and families received $1,000.  §  Directed that all clients will engage in only one Productive Choice: taking care of themselves and their families. They are not required to report on this productive choice. §  Streamlined administrative processes so Client Services Officers (CSOs) can focus on working with clients. §  Exempted monetary donations from being counted as income in their IA benefits, as of April 2020. These may be in the form of gifts from friends, family, benevolent organizations or Indigenous governments.  §  “Payrolled” all clients so that they do not have to report each month; ensuring they receive their payments consistently, and avoids in-person reporting.  §  Modified the intake approach for new clients. Clients have been working with CSOs over the phone or by appointment as necessary, requiring minimal verification to ensure they are registered as quickly as possible. They have been automatically assessed for both basic needs and enhanced benefits. §  Exempted the one-time Special Goods and Services Tax (GST) credit for low and modest income residents. §  Exempted the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB). Informed IA clients through handouts, radio ads, and in-person meetings that both the CERB and the CESB are taxable benefits.  §  Exempted the one-time Special Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) payments. §  Exempted the one-time Special Payment for certified holders of the Disability Tax Credit.   Related links COVID-19 Income Security Program changes General Information on COVID-19 in the NWT Applying for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit through the Canada Revenue Agency   For Media Requests, please contact:  Melissa Bannister 					Education, Culture and Employment 					Government of the Northwest Territoriesmelissa_bannister@gov.nt.ca  "

Mr. Jones has found insufficient grounds to warrant an inquiry and has concluded that the complaint is vexatious and was not made in good faith, “I absolutely believe that the behaviour of all Ministers and Regular Members of the Legislative Assembly must be above reproach, in keeping with the great responsibility and trust that the people of the Northwest Territories have placed in us, and fully support the legitimate use of established processes and tools for holding us to account,   “While I am pleased that an independent authority has examined all the facts related to Mr. Jacobson’s complaint and made an unbiased determination about the truth of the allegations, it is disappointing that this formal process meant to uphold the dignity and integrity of the Legislative Assembly and its Members was evidently used for reasons unrelated to our role or work as government,  “All Members were elected to serve the people of the Northwest Territories and work hard to address the needs and priorities of residents and communities. These unfounded allegations have been a significant distraction that have taken up valuable time and attention from Ministers, Members and officials that could have been better used advancing work that would benefit the territory,   “The past few months have been difficult ones for my new Cabinet and a new government, as the whole territory has had to deal with an unexpected global pandemic that is affecting the territory at all levels. I am proud of all the Ministers, who have risen to the challenge of COVID-19 and their new roles.  “Now that Mr. Jones has made his report, I look forward to putting this distraction behind us and to all Members of the Legislative Assembly being able to focus full time on working together in a respectful and professional manner to chart a path out of the current pandemic, advance the priorities of the Legislative Assembly and mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories.”   Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom added: “I am relieved to receive the report of the NWT Integrity Commissioner and his decision to dismiss the complaint against the Premier and myself. I take my role as Minister of Health and Social Services seriously and am committed to doing the best job I can to help protect the health of all residents of the NWT. The past few months have been challenging, both on a personal and professional level, and I am now looking forward to focusing on the job I was chosen to do by the voters of Inuvik Boot Lake and the Members of the Legislative Assembly.” "

Steady progress in transforming the Child and Family Services System to better meet the needs of children and youth was made since the December update. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused delays in the ongoing completion of some quality reviews.  Measuring compliance on key requirements for all quality reviews is expected to be completed by October 2020. A balance between the safety and well-being of children and youth and respecting the public health orders put in place by the Chief Public Health Officer needed to be made.  Child and Family Services had to quickly adjust its services by determining and addressing risks to children, youth, families, caregivers, and frontline staff.   To date, 50% of action items in the plan have been completed.  Progress on key actions includes: Received an additional investment of $3.7 million to add 20 new positions to support Child and Family Services, increased funding for training initiatives, and funding to support the implementation of youth in care network(s) for the NWT.  Offered training to a number of foster caregivers and foster care staff from across the NWT on how to support children and youth with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder.

The Quality Improvement Plan is a living document. The Department continuously assesses the system’s capacity to produce key deliverables, which allows for the ability to be flexible and to modify timelines.  The Plan identifies four underlying strategic directions to improve the system and address priorities:  							Culture of Quality: Embedding quality practice into our culture Human Resource Planning: Making sure the right people are in the right places Building Staff Capacity: Investing in our staff Engagement: Drawing on the knowledge and experience of others  Since October 2018, the vacancy rate in the Child and Family Services System has decreased from 25% to 6.3%.

Overall, 81 percent of NWT business respondents reported a significant decrease in revenues.  Tourism businesses experienced the largest revenue decreases in April and May followed by those working in transportation.  Together, these two industries saw their revenues decline by an average of 71 percent. Thanks to steps taken to keep diamond mines and the public sector active, the NWT economy will not be impacted as significantly as in other Canadian jurisdictions. Our economy is expected to contract by 3.3% in 2020; but that is significantly less than the national average of 8.2% forecast by the Conference Board of Canada.  While not all sectors will rebound at the same rate or to the same degree, over 90 percent of businesses surveyed in April and May said, they felt they could survive the COVID-19 pandemic. The GNWT’s Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment has administered three surveys since March to evaluate the impact that COVID-19 is having on NWT businesses and the economy – and to help identify where support is needed to promote economic recovery.  While preliminary findings are available, a consumer survey conducted in June to measure the demand-side of the economy is still being compiled.   Quote “The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected economies worldwide, including the NWT economy. While we know that the pandemic is not over yet, we are already making plans to safely re-start our economy with the appropriate measures in place to protect public health, in consultation with Members of the Legislative Assembly, business, and Indigenous and community governments. These surveys will help inform our joint planning and our continuing efforts to support and sustain the NWT economy and businesses.  - Hon. Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry Tourism and Investment     Quick facts Government and Mining will continue to support the NWT economy primarily through procurement opportunities.   Consumer spending and small business spending has rebounded since May. 71% of NWT residents say they are likely to travel within the NWT in the next 6 months.

Simpson wrapped up the 2019-2020 school year with a teleconference on July 7, 2020 with Northwest Territories (NWT) Education Leaders and the NWT Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) to reflect on lessons learned from the final months of the 2019-2020 school year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Much more is now known about COVID-19 since the early days of the pandemic in March, when education bodies made the decision to close schools. This increased understanding, coupled with evolving advice from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO), has allowed education bodies to proceed with the development of comprehensive reopening plans for each school, aimed at keeping students in school as much as possible in the 2020-2021 school year. Although education leaders have always understood and supported schools to be hubs for learning and social development and safe spaces for children and youth, the pandemic has reemphasized the vital role schools play in each community. For the benefit of students and their families, ECE and education leaders will be supporting education bodies to keep schools open as much as possible, even if there are new cases of COVID-19 in the territory. As decisions are made related to a potential second wave of COVID-19, these decisions will be made not out of fear, but based on the most up-to-date public health research and recommendations. Central to the need for continuing in-person education wherever possible are the technological challenges of providing full-time distance learning. The pandemic has highlighted gaps in telecommunications infrastructure, capacity and equipment in communities and homes across the NWT, and attempts to lean upon those technologies full-time would be technically, financially, mentally and emotionally unsustainable for a large percentage of NWT students and their families. Education leaders cautioned that the unpredictable circumstances of the pandemic could result in some schools closing temporarily due to COVID-19. In these instances, schools will be prepared to adapt to blended or distance learning for students. An increased understanding of COVID-19 and reflection on lessons learned has helped to place a priority focus on continuing full-time, in-person learning, especially for the youngest students in Junior Kindergarten up to Grade 9, who are at lowest risk of getting or spreading COVID-19. Regardless of grade level, all students will be provided with opportunities for continued learning throughout the 2020-2021 school year. All leaders agreed that the high level of interagency collaboration and communication maintained since March, including daily meetings between ECE and education superintendents, biweekly education leaders’ meetings, and regular communications between ECE and the OCPHO, was critical in allowing the education system to respond effectively and consistently to COVID-19 with a focus on equity across regions. Education leaders’ meetings will begin again in late summer and continue throughout the 2020-2021 school year. Quotes: “The COVID-19 pandemic has been an important learning experience for the education system in adapting to rapidly changing information while working to ensure the health and safety of all. Although we could not have foreseen the pandemic, our coordination with the Chief Public Health Officer and education bodies over the past months has allowed us to put the planning in place for the 2020-2021 school year so we can reopen schools safely for the benefit of our students and communities.” 					-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “The school closures in March 2019 were a wakeup call to us all. Education bodies had to mobilize quickly to deliver the best quality education possible under the circumstances. Although there were many successes, we have learned a great deal about the various challenges in each of our jurisdictions. Our goal is to continue to work closely with the Chief Public Health Officer, ECE and the NWTTA to open schools as much as possible, while ensuring the safety and success of all NWT students. Once our individual school plans are approved by the OCPHO, each education body will be able to share their plans with their stakeholders.” 					-Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   Media Inquires:  Cabinet Communications 					Government of the Northwest Territoriespresssecretary@gov.nt.ca    "

During their regular biweekly teleconference with Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) Minister R.J. Simpson on Tuesday, NWT education leaders expressed a strong sense of responsibility to publicly support the peaceful protests of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement that have been taking place globally following the death of African-American George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis on May 25. Education leaders also took the opportunity Tuesday to emphasize the need to continue fighting for an end to systemic racism targeting Indigenous peoples. Recent examples of this intolerable racism, education leaders said, are the death of 26-year-old Chantel Moore, an Indigenous woman, by police during a wellness check June 4 in New Brunswick, and the violent arrest March 10 of Athabasca Chipewyan Chief Allan Adam in northern Alberta for expired vehicle license plates. Education leaders noted many NWT students have been significantly impacted by recent events and demonstrations related to racism. They encourage students to think deeply about how they can positively effect change in the fight against all forms of racism and intolerance, including ethnic, religious, and sexuality or gender-based discrimination.  Indigenous families across the territory continue to deal with the trauma of generations of residential school abuse and historic injustices, education leaders said. They acknowledged that schools have an important role in educating and empowering students to reject all forms of racism and intolerance.  ECE and education bodies continue to focus on development of new curricula and ways of incorporating current affairs to ensure historical injustices related to racism and colonialism are actively addressed in student and teacher learning.   Quotes “Education plays a critical role in addressing legacies of racism and other forms of discrimination in our society. I stand beside NWT education leaders in supporting Black Lives Matter and other anti-racist movements, and urge our students to collectively confront racism in their classrooms, communities and country.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “’If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.’ NWT leaders and our youth cannot be quietly neutral about horrific historic and modern-day discrimination against Indigenous peoples. We must stand up for change and equality.”   -Darlene Gruben, Chair, Beaufort-Delta Divisional Education Council, quoting South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu    “As education leaders, we have a responsibility to affirm and show solidarity with movements for equality and social justice, internationally, nationally and locally. Systemic racism marginalizes countless groups across our global society and leads to inequities that must be eradicated.” -Tina Drew, Chair of Yellowknife Education District No.1, on behalf of all NWT education leaders   Quick facts ·       BLM is an organized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience to protest police brutality against African-American people. The movement began in 2013 with the use of hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 fatal shooting of African-American youth Trayvon Martin. George Floyd’s 2020 death by police has prompted global protests.    For media inquiries, contact: Cabinet Communications Government of the Northwest Territories presssecretary@gov.nt.ca  "
606,2020-07-07,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/gnwt-extends-territorial-public-health-emergency,Government Website,GNWT Extends Territorial Public Health Emergency,"The Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom has extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) Dr. Kami Kandola.  The global COVID-19 pandemic is not over and new cases continue to be reported in other Canadian jurisdictions. Strong public health measures continue to be necessary to ensure that the risk to NWT residents is managed and the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is prepared to respond quickly to any new cases and take appropriate steps to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our territory.   While public health measures will continue, the GNWT has determined that there is sufficient authority under the Public Health Act to implement them, and will not be extending the State of Emergency under the Emergency Management Act.  The GNWT declared the State of Emergency early in the pandemic to make sure it was ready to take extraordinary steps to support the implementation of public health orders. As the NWT has been successful at managing the risk of COVID-19 using the tools available under the Public Health Act, it has not had to draw on the additional authorities available under the Emergency Management Act.  The GNWT will continue to review its actions and arrangements for responding to the pandemic to ensure they remain effective and are aligned with the current circumstances, including relaxed restrictions as identified in Emerging Wisely. If deemed necessary, such as in the event of evidence of community spread in a second wave, and the need for additional powers, the GNWT is prepared to re-enact a State Of Emergency.  The Government of the Northwest Territories is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT is restricted upon arrival with limited exceptions. Everyone entering the NWT is required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith - with few exceptions.

Two funding initiatives to support licensed child care programs have been extended until September 30, 2020: funding to pay up to 75% of eligible fixed costs for child care operators; and funding supports for enhanced cleaning of child care spaces. The GNWT will also continue to waive certain fees for residents and businesses, including: Deh Cho Bridge tolls (extended to Sept 30, 2020); truck permits (Sept 30, 2020); NWT airport landing fees (Dec 31, 2020); and Leases, licences, and concession fees at all NWT airports (Dec 31, 2020).

Simpson repealed the 2016 Ministerial Directive on Enrolment of Students in the French First Language Programs today. The Directive will be replaced by new regulations under the NWT Education Act prior to the start of the 2020-2021 school year. The decision to repeal was made after discussions with stakeholders and in response to concerns regarding the administration of the 2016 Directive and the need to provide more clarity around admission requirements. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) will be consulting education bodies on the new regulations this summer. It is proposed that the new regulations will include the same three categories for admission into French First Language schools as the directive. These include reacquisition (those whose ancestors were rights-holders), new immigrant and non-citizen Francophone streams. Consultation will also include the possibility of a fourth stream of admission that would take French-speaking non-rights-holders into consideration. The regulations will not be more restrictive than the 2016 Directive. New regulations will only pertain to applications for the 2020-2021 school year and beyond. Applications that are currently under judicial review continue to be subject to the Directive.    Quote “The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to supporting the protection of the French language through the provision of French First Language education in the NWT. Codifying the Directive in regulations that will be based on lessons learned and consultation with stakeholders will ensure greater clarity around enrolment in French First Language schools.” - RJ Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   Quick facts The 2016 Ministerial Directive on Enrolment in French First Language Programs outlines which non-rights-holders can be admitted to French First Language schools in the NWT. Rights-holders under Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are automatically enrolled. There are three categories of admission under the 2016 Directive: 		Reacquisition: The parent would have been a rights holder but for his or her lack of opportunity to attend a French first language school or his or her parent’s lack of opportunity to attend a French first language school (i.e. the child’s grandparent);  New immigrants: The parent is an immigrant to Canada, whose child upon arrival does not speak English or French and is enrolling in a Canadian school for the first time. Non-citizen Francophones: The parent meets the criteria of section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms except for the fact that he or she is not a Canadian citizen.

The GNWT is responsible for the purchase, transport, and storage of fuel in 16 communities that are not served by the private sector: Colville Lake, Délı̨nę, Fort Good Hope, Gametì, Jean Marie River, Łutselk’e, Nahanni Butte, Paulatuk, Sachs Harbour, Sambaa K'e, Tsiigehtchic, Tulita, Ulukhaktok, Wekweètì, Whatì and Wrigley. Local contractors sell and distribute these petroleum products to residents and businesses in their communities. Prices are being adjusted by the GNWT following the completion of the winter fuel resupply program, which concluded on April 9. These prices are based on the real costs of completing that program, which includes fuel, transportation and taxes. The specific changes vary by commodity and by community. In most cases, non-government customers’ prices for heating fuel, motive diesel and gasoline will decrease. The prices of naphtha and jet fuel will be increasing in all communities except for one.  Current prices and prices as of July 1st are available on our website.   Quote “In recent months fuel prices across Canada have decreased, which is good news for NWT residents. The fuel resupply by winter road is complete and now residents in most NWT remote communities will pay less to fill their home heating oil tanks and their vehicles.” - Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Infrastructure    Quick facts ·       The Fuel Services of the Department of Infrastructure administrates the Petroleum Products Program. ·       The winter fuel resupply program was completed on April 9, 2020. ·       New prices will be in effect on July 1, 2020.   Related links ·       List of fuel products sold in each community   Media Requests, please contact:  Department of Infrastructure 						Government of the Northwest Territories  Email: INF_Communications@gov.nt.ca  "
618,2020-06-30,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/gnwt-adjusts-isolation-centre-payment-policy,Government Website,GNWT adjusts isolation centre payment policy,"The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is requiring certain non-residents to pay isolation centre costs. Since the beginning of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the GNWT has been paying the costs of all stays in the territory’s four isolation centres. The amended policy adjusts that approach for some individuals.  Non-residents who have received an exemption from the travel restrictions where alternative arrangements have not previously been made will now be required to pay for the cost of their stay at an isolation centre. This will come into effect on July 1, 2020. The GNWT will continue to pay the costs of staying in isolation centres for residents of the NWT and those intending to become residents.  Self-isolation requirements for workers, including essential service workers, supply chain workers, and non-resident workers, who are already employed, will need to have their isolation costs arranged and paid for by the employer or as otherwise agreed to between the employer and the employee. This is the same as the existing arrangement. As the GNWT continues to implement the Emerging Wisely plan it is critical that appropriate public health measures continue to be followed to reduce the risk of exposing residents to the virus responsible for COVID-19 and importing the virus from outside the NWT. This shift in approach is both fiscally responsible while also respecting the needs and rights of the residents of the NWT and Canada.   Quote: “Northwest Territories travel restrictions and self-isolation protocols will continue so long as they are needed to keep our people and communities safe. Requiring non-residents to pay isolation centre costs demonstrates our commitment to being fiscally responsible and sufficiently flexible to meet unique and exceptional circumstances.”   - Caroline Cochrane, Premier and Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs   Quick facts ·       The four isolation centres are in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River and Fort Smith. ·       The average cost for one person to stay in an isolation centre for 14-day self-isolation period is approximately $4,100.     Related links ·       NWT travel restrictions ·       Compassionate and Family Reunification Exemptions      For media requests, please contact: Darren Campbell Municipal and Community Affairs Government of the Northwest Territories Darren_P_Campbell@gov.nt.ca"

This amendment will apply to MPR workers when they return from the jobsite to their homes and includes updating the social distancing protocols NWT MPR workers must follow while outside the jobsite. .They will still be required to comply with all other restrictions in-place for returning to and working at site.  The original Order directed at the Mineral and Petroleum Industry was developed while the NWT was in containment. The level of risk of exposure to COVID-19 for MPR workers living in the NWT no longer aligns with the level of social distancing restrictions placed on the workers. This has changed thanks to widespread testing which has indicated no evidence of community spread in the NWT, and good processes that are in-place to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 at jobsites.  All workers employed at NWT oil and gas, mining, and other remote sites that do not live in the territory are still subject to the same restrictions while they are no longer at the jobsite and in their home jurisdictions. This includes limiting social interaction to immediate household members inside and outside the home.   Quote “Our public health orders are designed to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 as people continue to enter our territory from places where the virus is more prevalent. This amendment ensures all residents are able to enjoy the ease in restrictions that our territory is awarded as a result of the immediate actions put in place by the Chief Public Health Officer and NWT residents who played their part early on and made sure those measures were followed. .  - Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services    Quick facts The public health order directed at the Mineral and Petroleum Industry outlines specific social distancing protocols and behaviours which must be followed by all workers before coming to the job site in order to reduce contact with others.  The original Order limited activities to MPR workers such as getting haircuts or eating out. These activities are now allowed under Relaxing Phase Two.  This change only applies to NWT resident MPR workers and is simply meant to clarify that while these workers are at home they can also experience the relaxed measures already being experienced by their fellow community members.

Both extensions will take effect as of June 24, 2020 and expire on July 08, 2020. Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) Dr. Kami Kandola.  Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. The COVID-19 pandemic continues in Canada and around the world. To protect the health of NWT residents, there will continue to be a need for appropriate public health measures and restrictions, including the continuation of the state of Public Health Emergency and the implementation of public health orders issued and enforced by the CPHO. As a result of these measures, the NWT has been successful in managing the risk of COVID-19 to date and has been able to begin implementing Emerging Wisely, the CPHO’s plan for relaxing public health restrictions.  From the start, the addition of the State Of Emergency to support the Public Health Emergency was a proactive measure to ensure the government’s preparedness to respond to any situation that may arise. Extension of the State of Emergency continues to give the GNWT the option of accessing exceptional powers under the Emergency Management Act to support implementation of the Public Health Emergency and public health orders if needed.  The GNWT will continue to review its actions and arrangements for responding to the pandemic to ensure they remain effective and are aligned with the current circumstances, including relaxed restrictions as identified in Emerging Wisely.   The Government of the Northwest Territories is reminding everyone that travel within the NWT is restricted with limited exceptions. Everyone entering the NWT is still required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith before travelling to their home community – with few exceptions. .

Simpson met with Northwest Territories (NWT) Education Leaders and the NWT Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) via teleconference on June 16, 2020 to discuss details of school reopening plans and how learning will be maintained throughout the 2020-2021 school year. All NWT schools have submitted plans for approval to reopen for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools are striving to provide a safe way for students to receive as much in-person, curriculum-based instructional time in classrooms with teachers as possible, with new health and safety procedures and restrictions in place. When full-time in-person learning is not possible, education will be delivered through a blended learning approach, where students are learning part time in school, as well as part time at home or on the land. Distance learning will also be available for students who cannot attend school due to higher health risks, or in cases where schools must close temporarily due to serious health and safety concerns posed by COVID-19.  The COVID-19 pandemic is a dynamic situation and plans may need to change as new information or public health and workplace safety requirements are identified. Education bodies are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020, which includes measures to ensure schools are able to remain open, to the extent possible, if there are new COVID-19 cases in the NWT and that, regardless of circumstances, students will continue to learn. Schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases, and parents, guardians, students and communities should be prepared for the learning situation to change quickly in response to evolving circumstances.  Education Leaders discussed how to best communicate school reopening plans with the public. Details of reopening plans will vary for each school and grade level, and will be shared with students, staff, parents, guardians and the public once reviewed and approved by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer. A high level public document will also be released that lays out what the public can generally expect to see at schools in the upcoming 2020-2021 school year. ECE and its education partners are working diligently to create a supportive and effective learning environment for students in the 2020-2021 school year and beyond, and are committed to providing regular updates to the public as plans move forward for the upcoming school year. Quotes: “As we work together to develop plans to reopen schools in the fall, we continue to anticipate the ongoing and evolving challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools will be taking a flexible approach that prioritizes in-person learning, while providing alternative options for continued learning to ensure our students continue to receive education while we protect the health and safety of students, staff and communities.” 	-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “Although there are many moving parts to consider, all education bodies are staying the course and are now developing plans for the 2020-2021 school year. Once our school plans are approved by the OCPHO, we will be able to share the details with parents, remembering that changes may still be forthcoming. We are proud of our work and look forward to sharing our plans with our stakeholders soon.” -Erin Currie, Chair of Yellowknife Catholic Schools, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   Media inquiries: Cabinet Communications 	Government of the Northwest Territoriespresssecretary@gov.nt.ca  "

As restrictions are eased by the Chief Public Health Officer, and in keeping with the spirit of flexibility, the SEED program can now be accessed to cover costs to businesses such as: ·       Structural changes required to protect employees (i.e. plexiglas shields); ·       Capital improvements (i.e. drive through windows or outdoor patios for restaurants);  ·       Investments related to shifting operations online; and  ·       The purchase of personal protective equipment for employees.   Businesses that have already made such investments on their own will be permitted to apply for a portion of this investment, retroactive to April 1, 2020.  Applications should clearly demonstrate financial need and the need for the proposed improvements in order to open and function properly.  The remaining elements of the existing SEED policy - including funding maximums - remain in place. Funding proposals will still need to be forward-looking and include a viable business case.   Quote: “We have stated from the outset that our programming will be flexible. We have listened to the concerns of businesses and are prepared to offer support and do what we can to help businesses operate in the post-COVID environment.

I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to the members who have agreed to be a part of this advisory body. I’d also like to thank Ms. Jenni Bruce from the Northwest Territories Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Paul Gruner, President of Det’on Cho Corporation, for agreeing to serve as the Committee’s co-chairs. “While I was pleased to address Members, my role in future meetings will be to listen. The Council will report independently on its work, priorities, and recommendations, and I look forward to receiving this input.  “With over 300 years of collective business experience in the North, and leadership from within the NWT’s business community itself, the Business Advisory Council is well positioned to be a representative voice for NWT businesses to the Government of the Northwest Territories.  “These are difficult economic times, but together and with the insight from the Business Advisory Council and Members of the Legislative Assembly, I know that we can move forward and emerge wisely from this crisis to revitalize, strengthen, and grow our economy into the future.”"

The system includes passes for residents from the NWT and Alberta representing various situations and activities commonly shared between Fort Smith, Fort Fitzgerald, Smith’s Landing, and other nearby communities.  NWT residents from outside of Fort Smith are also able to access this system – opening up staycation possibilities for NWT residents.  For NWT residents: ·       Standard access pass: allows for day-use travel in-and-out of the NWT as far as Fort Fitzgerald and the Salt River Day Use area, and provides an authorized exemption to the self-isolation protocol requirements.  ·       Limited access pass: allows for overnight travel in Alberta where the final destination is north of Hay Camp on Highway 61, or north of Peace Point on Highways 58 and 60 (includes Pine Lake). ·       Restricted access pass: allows for overnight travel Passes for travel originating in the NWT for travel to and from Alberta where the final destination is farther than Hay Camp on Highway 61, or farther than Peace Point on Highways 58 and 60.  For Alberta residents:  ·       Standard access: Non-NWT residents traveling within the NWT where their travel originates in Alberta north of and including the vicinity of Fort Fitzgerald and the Salt River Day Use area may be issued a Standard Access Pass for day use access to the Town of Fort Smith and the immediate vicinity. ·       Limited access: Non-NWT residents traveling within the NWT where their travel originates in Alberta north of Hay Camp on Highway 61, or north of Peace Point on Highways 58 and 60 (includes Pine Lake) may be issued a Limited Access Pass for day use access to the Town of Fort Smith and the immediate vicinity. ·       Restricted access: Non-NWT residents traveling within the NWT where their travel originates in Alberta north of Hay Camp on Highway 61, or north of Peace Point on Highways 58 and 60 (includes Pine Lake) may be issued a Limited Access Pass for day use access to the Town of Fort Smith and the immediate vicinity.

The GNWT continues to work with Transport Canada and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) towards additional funding for the NWT aviation industry beyond June 30, 2020. Quote This funding will help northern aviation companies continue to operate as they deal with the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic. While this is an important step that will help these companies to stay in the air in the short-term, we must continue to work with our federal partners to ensure that longer-term support is available to support the aviation industry. —Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance Quick facts Today’s funding announcement covers the period of April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020.

Amendments have been made to form a two-territory travel bubble with Nunavut.    Other amendments include clarification on requirements for those moving to the NWT and traveling within the NWT for work or school. There is also additional clarity for family reunification as a compassionate exemption.    Notice of Future Amendments    Future amendments will also be made to the travel order to allow exemptions for residents of the NWT who are employed as:    Supply chain workers Flight crews Airline employees These workers regularly leave the territory for employment purposes and return in the course of the same day. They have minimal contact with other communities and therefore the need to self-isolate, so long as the right precautions are taken are not necessary.    These situations to date have been handled on a case-by-case. The future amendments would eliminate the need for this burdensome implementation step, and provide clear precautions for these workers to abide by.   Quote(s): “I am pleased that our territory has reached a point where the Chief Public Health Officer feels it is safe to move into phase two of the Emerging Wisely Plan.  Reaching new phases is an important part in making sure our territory is moving forward and able to focus efforts on recovery. As we continue to meet these milestones, the GNWT will continue to work together and find ways to support NWT residents and ensure the health and safety of our people, territory and economy are at the forefront of our decisions.  - Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories     “The changes residents of the NWT have made to the way they live, work, and play during the COVID-19 pandemic, is what has allowed us to reach this phase two milestone. As we enjoy the loosened restrictions though, we are accepting more risk and more responsibility. Chances are we will get more cases in the future, so playing our part and following the rules and recommendations are more critical than ever to keep the ones we love safe.”  	- Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services   “I’m pleased we’ve reached a point where we can revitalize our communities and un-cancel summer. But remember – COVID-19 is unforgiving, and it can move silently. So be on high-alert – not just for today. Get used to good habits we’ve been practicing as we prepare for a large surge of infections across Canada most experts believe will come this fall. Keep up with the basics: wash your hands, cough and sneeze into a tissue or flexed elbow, stay two metres apart, keep your get-togethers small, wear a non-medical mask when you’re out and unable to keep your distance, and stay home if you’re sick. That’s how we can keep each other safe.”  - Dr. Kami Kandola, NWT Chief Public Health Officer   Quick facts: The two-territory travel bubble will allow NWT residents to visit Nunavut without needing to self-isolate upon return, and vice-versa once Nunavut has completed the requisite changes to their public health orders. As of today, Nunavut residents will be able to visit the NWT without self-isolating.  This will not exempt Nunavummiut who are required to self-isolate when returning from travel outside of their territory.  Residents should note that travel originating anywhere other than the Northwest Territories continues to not be permitted in Nunavut. They will not be able to enter.  Self-isolation is still required to take place in the existing isolation communities – Fort Smith, Hay River, Yellowknife, and Inuvik.  For those coming for professional reasons, the GNWT will not be responsible for costs if an established isolation centre must be used.  Existing processes for essential workers, infrastructure workers, those supporting essential workers (i.e. childcare providers), and remote camp workers remain the same.

Simpson: Planning for the Junior Kindergarten – Grade 12 2020-2021 School Year,"Mr. Speaker, as the end of the 2019-2020 school year approaches, planning for how to safely reopen schools in the fall is well underway. The Department of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) is working diligently with its education partners to create a supportive and effective learning environment for students in the 2020-2021 school year, and beyond. 	  As we emerge wisely into more relaxed public health restrictions, I want to be clear: the upcoming school year will not be a return to normal. I understand that all of us want desperately to get back into our routines and have this crisis end. That cannot happen this fall and the number one priority of my office and the Department of ECE has to remain the health and safety of our students and education staff. Schools will be taking strong action to meet the recommendations of the Chief Public Health Officer while providing Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 education programs and services starting this fall and we continue to need the support of all our residents to make this happen. 	  Mr. Speaker, ECE and education bodies responsible for delivering education are working on a coordinated, system-wide approach for the coming school year that is based on the detailed criteria provided by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer on how to safely reopen schools. This approach is focused on achieving the following priorities: Maintaining the health and safety of students, staff and communities; Starting the school year on time; Maximizing in-person learning, as much as possible; Seeking equity across regions; Maintaining financial supports to schools, and the programs they offer; and, Supporting continuity of learning. While details on specific health and safety measures will vary from school to school, Mr. Speaker, there are some general measures that will be enacted in schools across the NWT to help maintain physical distance. These include: Limits on class sizes; Enhanced cleaning and disinfecting practices; Strict hand-washing routines; Designated entrances and exits; Staggered breaks, drop-offs and dismissals; Use of personal protective equipment by staff and students when physical distance cannot be maintained; Spacing of desks and other furniture; Restricting and managing flow in hallways and common areas, through floor markings and/or physical barriers; Encouraging activities to take place outdoors, when possible; Restrictions on assemblies, choir and music classes, drama, team sports and other gatherings, where physical distancing is not possible; and, Limited access to schools for parents, guardians and visitors. Education will be delivered, based on factors such as school size and layout, grade level, the number of students and staff, access to technology, and the unique needs of each student. Individual schools will be making adjustments to student transportation, food programs and scheduling in order to accommodate public health recommendations. 	  In our smaller schools, it is likely that students will be safely accommodated within the existing space, and will not need to rely as much on distance learning. However, larger schools with more staff and students will have a harder time delivering the full extent of education programming within the school space. In these situations, schools may access space outside of the school, provide a blended learning approach that will prioritize in-person learning, or continue to support at-home distance learning if necessary. 	  Mr. Speaker, this is a dynamic situation and plans for the coming school year may need to change as new information or public health and workplace safety requirements are identified. Education bodies are taking a flexible approach to their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020 to ensure schools are able to open and remain open. The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to providing regular updates to the public as plans move forward for the upcoming school year. 	  Each school will need to have its reopening plan assessed and approved by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer and the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission. All schools are working to have their detailed plans submitted before the end of the current school year, and details of these will be made available to students, parents, guardians and staff once those plans are reviewed and approved. In addition, ECE will be publishing a territorial plan on reopening schools for the 2020-21 school year later this month. 	  Mr. Speaker, the health and safety of residents and communities of the NWT is our primary concern. As we near the end of this school year, ECE remains committed to providing support to education leaders, students, parents, guardians and teachers as we truly work together to meet public health and safety requirements, while supporting the critical learning and well-being of all NWT students.  	  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
647,2020-06-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-partner-and-staff-appreciation-covid-efforts,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Partner and Staff Appreciation for COVID Efforts,"Mr. Speaker, increasing the number of affordable homes and reducing core housing need is a priority of this government. The difficult times that we are emerging from highlight that safe and secure housing is one of our highest needs.  The delivery of housing services became more challenging given our need to stay healthy in preparation of COVID-19 through physical distancing. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the individuals and organizations involved in ensuring safe housing and affordable shelters are available to our residents.  Many of these people work behind the scenes delivering critical services for housing solutions and emergency repairs.   I am proud and grateful for the work being done by the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation staff and all of our community partners, such as local housing organizations and emergency shelter providers that help us to provide housing and homeless supports.  These important front-line workers support approximately 2,800 units under Northwest Territories Housing Corporation programming and five emergency overnight shelters. Indigenous government partners worked diligently with the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation.  When faced with the uncertainty of how COVID-19 would impact their communities, the Délı̨nę Got’ı̨nę Government and the Łutsël K'é Dene First Nation had no hesitation in offering to take on the administration of some public housing units for the purposes of self-isolation.  While ultimately, these units were not required to address COVID-19, these communities and their leaders demonstrated to their people that they were prepared to do what it takes to keep their residents safe. I want also to thank the private industry for their contributions during this time.  Many landlords faced their own economic pressures. In the community of Hay River, I want to thank the owners of the North Country Inn, which was utilized to support some residents experiencing homelessness.  Large industry also wanted to help out.  In Norman Wells, Imperial Oil Limited offered the use of some of its staff housing should it be required. I want to recognize the work of staff at the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation who successfully continued to deliver essential services such as emergency repair programming, rent support and the Homelessness Assistance Fund.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank our partners in delivering housing in the communities, who are facing their own challenges right now, like reductions in income, a lack of childcare, and dealing with the mental strain caused by the uncertainty around COVID-19. I want to express my gratitude for their commitment to housing our residents and their professionalism during this time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
648,2020-06-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-ministers-policing-priorities-2020-2021,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Minister’s Policing Priorities for 2020 - 2021 ,"In the Northwest Territories, we entrust the RCMP with the responsibility to support every citizen’s rights to safety and security; and, we also entrust them with the right to take away a citizen’s liberty in response to unlawful activity. That is a tremendous power and responsibility. We are fortunate to have the service of a professional and experienced national police force, and an RCMP division dedicated to community policing, but it remains critically important that we ensure our policing services reflect the unique context of our territory and the diversity of our people, and respect the trust that we are all placing in them every day. The ultimate goal we are all working towards together should be safe communities where our citizens can thrive. The Minister’s Policing Priorities for 2020-2021 have been under development since April and were already in their final form when the ongoing challenges of systemic racism within law enforcement took center stage around the globe.   As we are all acutely aware, the world has changed drastically over the past few months. While it may initially have been a global pandemic that illustrated the need for out-of-the-box thinking as it pertains to our justice and policing systems, it has been society’s recent awakening to the reality of racial injustice that has driven this home. It has become apparent that innovation and reform are necessary in these systems, and that the status quo is no longer acceptable.       We considered not presenting these priorities today through this statement, but decided we cannot shy away from the painful reality of racism and a potentially difficult conversation about policing.  So I will proceed to present the policing priorities today, and I look forward to engaging in more conversations with the RCMP and with the members.  For 2020-2021, the four themes of policing priorities are: first, promote confidence in policing services; second, adapt to changing enforcement and community policing landscapes; third, continue to improve the RCMP’s response to vulnerable population; and lastly, operational and fiscal innovation. Regarding the first priority, the need to build confidence and trust in those who we have trusted with our safety is foundational. Confidence will come from trust; trust requires a relationship and mutual respect. It is also something that must be constantly and consistently nurtured and protected.  To serve communities effectively, it is critical to acknowledge, reflect and learn from a past that has not always been characterized by mutual respect and use those lessons to improve understanding, empathy and cultural safety in how policing is done today. Some progress in establishing trust has been the creation of the Commanding Officer’s Aboriginal Advisory. In addition, the NWT has an Aboriginal Policing Services unit within G Division, and the division’s commanding officer has directed that all new members to a community must complete a personal biography to be presented to the community.  As well, they are required to attend a cultural orientation specific to the community where they have been placed, that includes meeting with local Indigenous organizations and Elders. Such steps should be recognized, but that does not mean the work is done; and so promoting confidence in policing remains a priority.   Northwest Territories communities have made it very clear how much harm they witness in their communities from alcohol misuse, drug trafficking and bootlegging. Bootlegging and substance abuse have been identified on almost every community’s Community Policing Action Plan. In addition to further cracking down on illegal alcohol and drug trafficking, we’ve also identified the need for more effective enforcement of impaired driving legislation as a means to keep our communities and streets safe.  The RCMP must continue to foster trust within communities to help residents feel more comfortable reporting illegal alcohol and drug trafficking and impaired driving which will allow the RCMP to implement more effective crime prevention and enforcement strategies. Although we know that root causes underlying the misuse of alcohol lie in areas beyond the influence of police, their enforcement efforts are integral to the disruption of the illegal networks taking advantage of people living with addictions and mental illness.  The Department of Justice on the RCMP as a first point of contact for the diversion of suitable matters to local restorative justice options such as the Community Justice Committees. Restorative justice practices and principles have long been linked to more positive outcomes for both offenders and victims. By increasing the use of more restorative practices, the RCMP will play a vital role in identifying matters for youth and adult diversion early in the justice system process.  The second priority, adapting to a changing community landscape, is linked to the third priority, which is: improve the RCMP’s response to vulnerable populations. 	The RCMP play a critical role acting as the first point of contact for many people experiencing family violence by informing victims of their rights and connecting those victims to community supports. Recognizing that family violence rates remain consistently high in the Northwest Territories; it is essential that RCMP members and Victim Service workers continue to collaborate so that victims’ rights are recognized and respected. With that said, we also recognize the challenges victims face in reporting sexual assault. We look to the RCMP to continue working with stakeholders and partners including the Department of Justice to implement solutions that would ensure a thorough investigation of a complaint in each and every case. Implementing trauma-informed investigative tools remains a best practice of our police officers and in turn, is an area of focus we’ve identified for the coming year. This lessens the impact of crime and trauma on victims and their families, while also aiding in healing and recovery. Proper training, and accurate use of investigative tools, go a long way to improving the quality of the response provided to survivors of violence.  Our last remaining priority, with connection to the third, is operational and fiscal innovation. Mr. Speaker, the world is experiencing an unprecedented challenge with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Policing is a critical piece of our emergency planning. The RCMP should continue careful planning to support safe communities, and the safety of their members, throughout this evolving situation. They should continue to participate in emergency planning within their scope at the territorial and federal level and collaborate wherever possible with territorial departments and agencies to help keep Northwest Territories residents safe. As we continue to work through the added challenges we face as a result of this pandemic, as well as addressing racism within law enforcement, it is more incumbent than ever on the Government of the Northwest Territories and the RCMP to work collaboratively to leverage our efforts for the benefit of our communities. While this might require some ingenuity, I am confident that we have appropriate and rigorous checks and balances in place to hold our organizations accountable to operate innovatively within the financial limits of our contract. In closing, I reiterate that annual Ministerial police priorities are part of a much wider conversation that includes acknowledging both a past and present that still needs much healing, about building trust and finding a way forward so that police services are partners in upholding and protecting the safety of all people.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
649,2020-06-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-covid-19-and-nwt-economy,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: COVID-19 and the NWT Economy,"Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted every aspect of life in our territory.   The Government of the Northwest Territories has responded to the pandemic in a variety of ways. In addition to the measures taken to protect the health and safety of our residents and communities, our government has acted to mitigate the economic impacts of this crisis on our economy, and to invest in the economic well-being of Northwest Territories industry and businesses.                                                                Mr. Speaker, we knew that for our economy to recover, we would need our mines and supporting industries to be operating, small businesses to be open, and our people to be working.   That being said, our first priority was to address the health and safety of entrepreneurs, business owners, and their employees.  Following that, we acted to ensure that Northwest Territories communities and residents would continue to receive critical supplies. With so many remote and dispersed communities, we are acutely aware of the importance of the supply chain, perhaps more so than some of our southern counterparts. Since these initial first steps, Mr. Speaker, the Departments of Infrastructure and Industry, Tourism and Investment  have rolled out a sequence of measured and organized steps, in tandem with the federal government, to ensure funding reliefs are available. Some of these reliefs include waiving fees impacting truckers and air carriers to provide nearly $2.5 million dollars in economic relief. We have also continued to advocate regularly to the federal government, on behalf of northern airlines facing unprecedented operating challenges due to the pandemic. Capital loans have also been made available through the Business Development and Investment Corporation to businesses that needed immediate liquidity.  Mr. Speaker, since March 20th, the GNWT has committed over $20 million dollars in off-sets and supports for NWT businesses.   Collectively, our territory, its governments, business chambers, and stakeholder organizations, have been able to deliver the message in Ottawa that we need specific and regionally-appropriate support programs for our businesses.   As a supplement to Canada’s national business relief plans, CanNor’s Northern Business Relief Fund significantly expanded relief options for NWT and Indigenous businesses.  On May 8th, the Minister of Finance announced $8.7 million for NWT airlines; the first of two phases of federal funding to help maintain the critical links that they provide.  On May 12th, with support from the federal government, the GNWT then announced a $6.2 million plan to top up wages for workers making less than $18 per hour.   Through all of this Mr. Speaker, we have also worked with our mines and resource companies to ensure their safe and continued operation. We have taken steps to protect mineral tenure in the NWT by suspending payment and work requirements until the end of June, and will be extending this relief for an additional 90 days.  We will need our resource sector to anchor our recovery.  Mining and exploration are the biggest source of private sector jobs and income for our residents, and as we get back to business, will be a major buyer of products and services from NWT companies.    The Mining Incentive Program has been adapted to support NWT prospectors and company-led mineral exploration projects, and to ensure that their projects this summer will be in line with orders and conditions of the Chief Public Health Officer. Mr. Speaker, much has been said about the need for economic stimulus and recovery but it is only thanks to our investments in relief efforts that we are able now to look forward. As we do, an important component of economic stimulus and recovery will be investment in GNWT infrastructure projects. Not only will these projects inject money into the economy, they will provide business and employment opportunities for our residents.   In 2020/2021 the GNWT is planning to invest over $500 million in infrastructure throughout the NWT.  This will allow us to deliver a total of 152 capital projects in 28 NWT communities, including schools, long-term care and health care facilities, and major transportation projects. Many of these projects are multi-year projects that will begin or continue this year. This investment continues to leverage significant federal infrastructure dollars. Mr. Speaker, the GNWT will continue to advocate and work with the federal government on infrastructure initiatives that lead to jobs, economic growth, and prosperity for both the NWT and Canada. Meanwhile, as NWT businesses begin to resume operations across the North, we have 	re-introduced our Support for Entrepreneurs and Economic Development Policy Program for the 20-2021 fiscal year.  It represents $4 million dollars of potential investment into projects in which community employment is emphasized, and where the bulk of the funding will be spent in our communities. Similarly, we will inject almost $4.4 million into parks infrastructure, tourism product development and community infrastructure projects this summer; supporting local suppliers, contractors, and employees as we improve our tourism product for the future. As we begin to Emerge Wisely from public health measures, Mr. Speaker, economic recovery will begin within our territory, and will depend greatly on what we can do for each other. The importance of the “BuyNorth” or “ShopNWT” message has never been as true as it is today.  Our recovery will also have to be in step with the needs and capacity of our business community.   The new Business Advisory Council will be the voice of NWT business to my office.  It will ensure that the experience, talent, and resources of the NWT’s private sector are considered in our decision making. And, as we look ahead, I believe the collective 	world-wide effort that will be put into economic recovery will bring new opportunities. If we can position ourselves to learn from the wave of innovation that I believe we will see, we can re-imagine our own economy for the future; one that continues to promote our wealth of natural resources, but also encourages a more diversified and resilient economy that builds upon our natural strengths. Thank you Mr. Speaker "

Premier Caroline Cochrane and Dehcho First Nations (DFN) Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian are pleased to announce today that the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is indefinitely extending a subsurface land withdrawal for the Edéhzhíe Protected Area. The extended withdrawal will complement this culturally and ecologically important region’s future designation as a National Wildlife Area.  A multi-stakeholder working group recommended the permanent protection of the ecological and cultural values of Edéhzhíe through National Wildlife Area designation under the Canada Wildlife Act. Completing the designation will honour shared principles and values between DFN and GNWT and support community job creation, climate action, regional decision-making, and implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.   Premier Cochrane and Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian are also announcing their highest level of commitment to complete the Dehcho Land Use Plan as soon as possible. The finalized Plan will provide a shared vision to respect land in the region in a manner that guides conservation and supports the economic, social and cultural well-being of residents in the Dehcho.   Quotes: “Our government has made a commitment to strengthening relationships with Indigenous governments and finding innovative solutions to outstanding challenges. I am very pleased to see the willingness of the Dehcho First Nations to engage with the GNWT and advance our shared priorities, including the protection of Edéhzhíe and the completion of the Dehcho Land Use Plan. By working together, I am confident that the GNWT and the DFN can build strong, trusting and respectful relationships that will resolve many of the complex challenges we have faced for decades.”  Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories  “Edéhzhíe represents a new government to government relationship and hope for the future. Our elders and leaders have always regarded Edéhzhíe as an important landmark. They worked faithfully to achieve permanent protection for many years and today we celebrate this important milestone. It ensures a successful future for Edéhzhíe that will help enable Dene survival and well being into the future. As Dene, we understand the importance of taking care of the land, and our relationship to the land, as being integral to our culture and language. In Dene Zhatié we have a saying, “yundáa gogha” meaning “for the future” and Edéhzhíe brings us renewed hope for future.” Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian, Dehcho First Nations “Edéhzhíe is a significant cultural and ecological area, and the work to advance the Edéhzhíe National Wildlife Area is an important piece of the land management picture for the Dehcho Region. This unique, Indigenous-led protected area is designed to preserve not only the biodiversity of the area, but also the rich cultural traditions of the people who call this land home.  I am very encouraged to see the GNWT and DFN focus on completing a Dehcho Land Use Plan. Having a complete picture for shared land management throughout the Dehcho Region will help communities and residents of the region build a stronger and more diverse regional economy.”  Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources, Minister of Lands  Quick Facts: Completed land use plans that reflect the priorities and values of Indigenous residents and governments, NWT residents and the federal and territorial governments are important tools for guiding shared decision making about the management of land and resources in applicable regions.  The GNWT land withdrawal provides indefinite protection for 14,200 square kilometres of subsurface land to complement the designation of an Edéhzhíe National Wildlife Area.  Designation of Edéhzhíe as a National Wildlife Area would provide new opportunities for Dehcho residents to participate in the conservation economy.  Creation of the National Wildlife Area will provide protection for critical boreal caribou habitat.  It would protect 1.1% of the NWT and contribute 0.14% to Canadian Biodiversity Target 1 (to protect 17% of Canada’s land and inland water).  With the establishment of Edéhzhíe the NWT has more than 17% of its land and freshwater protected.    Links Edéhzhíe (ENR) Department of Lands – Land Use Planning Dehcho First Nations Website Finding Common Ground - a renewed commitment to regional land use planning in the Northwest Territories Dehcho Land Use Planning Committee  Deh Cho First Nations Interim Measures Agreement Media inquiries:Trista Haugland                                                                      	Cabinet Communications                                                        	Government of the NWT                                                         	Tel: 867-767-9140 ext. 11090                                                             	Email: trista_haugland@gov.nt.ca Dahti Tsetso 	Director of Lands & Resources 	Dehcho First Nations 	Tel: 867-447-3526 	Email: Dahti_Tsetso@dehcho.org    "

652,2020-06-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-senior-citizens-month-june,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Senior Citizens Month - June,"Mr. Speaker, the month of June is designated as Senior Citizens Month in the NWT.  It is a time to recognize and show appreciation for the contribution made by seniors and elders to our communities, our families and society in general.  In the Northwest Territories, seniors continue to be the fastest growing demographic in our population.  In fact, it is projected that seniors and elders will comprise approximately 20 per cent of our territory’s population by 2035. This presents opportunities as well as challenges, Mr. Speaker.  We must ensure our seniors have a good quality of life that enables them to thrive and continue to be respected and contributing members of society.   One of the priorities of this 19th Legislative Assembly is to enable seniors to age in place with dignity. We must ensure that seniors have the necessary supports that allow them to live at home for as long as possible.  The GNWT is working across all levels of government and with community partners to ensure a wide range of social programs are available to meet the needs of seniors, including housing, financial and income supports, health care supports and accessible community infrastructure and transportation. Mr. Speaker, one serious challenge that negatively affects many of our seniors’ quality of life is elder abuse. June 15th is designated as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day to bring awareness and encourage dialogue around this important issue.   This is a topic that is uncomfortable to acknowledge or discuss, as elder abuse financial, emotional or physical can happen in a senior’s own home.  We must continue to address this so to ensure vulnerable seniors are protected.  The NWT Seniors’ Society has worked closely with the GNWT and has been instrumental in taking the lead on elder abuse prevention initiatives by way of awareness workshops and by providing a toll-free Seniors Information Line. To complement this support, the NWT Help Line service offers confidential counselling support for residents of all ages in need of support.  Mr. Speaker, one of our first responses to the COVID-19 pandemic was to ensure the safety and well-being of our seniors, particularly those residing in long-term care facilities.  We implemented a range of protective protocols and worked with families to ensure that residents could stay connected to those that love and care for them.  As the COVID pandemic response carries on, we will continue to deliver the services that seniors rely on.  We are collaborating with community agencies and non-government organizations to ensure they are aware of the federal funding available to provide local support to seniors during this challenging time. We are also working with the NWT Seniors’ Society to ensure communication material related to COVID-19 gets out to seniors in their Indigenous languages. This material will hopefully increase their awareness of the situation and how they can protect themselves, as well as reduce their anxiety about contracting the coronavirus.  The Department of Health and Social Services is also currently revising and updating the Seniors Information Handbook, Mr. Speaker.  This is a valuable resource for seniors, and those who support them, that provide listings of available services from numerous helpful sources. This Handbook was developed in partnership with GNWT departments and the NWT Seniors’ Society, and is updated periodically. It is available as both a hardcopy handbook and online now, and the updated version is in progress.  In closing, I want to assure our NWT seniors that the GNWT remains committed to protecting their health and safety during this uncertain time, as well as moving forward. We will continue to work cooperatively with Indigenous governments, government agencies and non-governmental organizations to achieve our goal of providing quality services for our seniors to ensure their able enjoy long and happy lives, here in the NWT.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The goal of the new system is to focus on a more user-friendly experience, allowing the GNWT to better track and manage the lifecycle of an application, and enhance accountability. It will also help foreign nationals who start, purchase or invest in an existing business as outlined in the NWT Immigration Strategy, Building a Skilled Workforce and Vibrant Economy 2017-2022. A recently developed Welcome to the NWT resource booklet will also assist in the attraction, settlement and retention of foreign nationals to the NWT. This booklet describes everything from initial checklists to schools, communities and cultures, employment, services, healthcare and weather. It is a comprehensive, plainly written resource available in both English and French.  The new online application system will support the population growth of the NWT. It will also be showcased in the launch of a campaign to attract foreign nationals abroad and already living and working in Canada, to help fill the critical labour market gaps in the NWT with skilled workers.  Quotes: 						“There are many people interested in living and working in the Northwest Territories, who will bring much needed skills and new industry to our economy. The new online system will make the application process easier and quicker for Nominee Program applicants, helping us to assist employers in meeting critical labour market needs.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “Among the most important investments that can be made to stimulate opportunity and diversity with regards to the Northwest Territories economy, are those to attract a healthy vibrant population. We recognize the considerable contribution that newcomers and immigrants can make to our territory and welcome those interested in making the North home. This new platform has been created to help meet this objective. 						- Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment Quick Facts: ·       Since 2016, the NWT has welcomed 17 business nominees, five of whom are currently operating their businesses in Hay River and 12 operating in Yellowknife. Together with their family members, these nominees bring new businesses services and numerous new residents to the territory.   ·       From 2009-2019, the Employer Stream of the Nominee Program has welcomed 427 nominees into the Northwest Territories. With their families, the total number of foreign nationals living and working in NWT communities is 819. ·       With NWT borders currently closed, we are seeing less foreign nationals able to travel to the NWT. The launch of the online application system allows people to start thinking about the immigration process as the decision to immigrate to a new country or territory takes months. It is important to continue raising the awareness of the NWT as a great place to live and work, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Simpson: Immigration and the Northwest Territories Nominee Program,"Mr. Speaker, we will defeat the scourge of COVID-19, and when we do, we will be better prepared to attract and welcome new residents. Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide an update on the new immigration related initiatives that the Department of Education, Culture and Employment has implemented or undertaken in the past six months, including an immigration settlement and integration pilot project, development of a new immigration stream, the creation of new resources for newcomers, and a refreshed website. I am also happy to officially announce the launch of the all new online application portal that will replace the current paper-based application process.  ECE delivers the Employer Stream of the Northwest Territories Nominee Program, which assists employers in filling workforce gaps with skilled and semi-skilled foreign nationals when local workers are not available. While the vast majority of the Nominees supported under the Nominee Program are already working in the Territory, we continue to receive requests for information from people around the world who are interested in coming here. The entry of foreign nationals into Canada is a federal responsibility so, like other provinces and territories, we work with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to ensure that processes and supports are in place when we welcome new residents to the Territory. In order to assist employers to build a skilled workforce while also supporting the immigration of foreign nationals who contribute to the economic development and success of the NWT, the Government of the Northwest Territories developed an Immigration Strategy, titled Building a Skilled Workforce and Vibrant Economy 2017-2022. Recent progress on the actions from the strategy include the development and implementation of a comprehensive marketing strategy to promote the NWT and the Nominee Program to both employers and foreign nationals at the local, national and international levels. We are also working to introduce a new program stream specific to Francophone foreign nationals, which we hope will encourage new residents to become a part of our vibrant francophone community in the North. With the input of local community organizations, we have developed a Welcome to the NWT resource booklet to provide key information to foreign nationals and newcomers on the services they need to settle, integrate and succeed in their new communities. This booklet shows newcomers what it is like to live here, and describes everything from initial checklists, to information on schools, community and government services, employment, healthcare, and weather. It is a very comprehensive, plainly written resource in both English and French and available on the ECE and immigratenwt.ca websites.  Mr. Speaker, the immigratenwt.ca website has been refreshed to a more vibrant story-centric site with testimonials, narratives and multimedia. It is one stop for all of the information we have on the Nominee Program, and now includes an online application portal.  The new online application system will be more user-friendly for the applicant, allow the departments to better track and manage the lifecycle of an application, and enhance accountability. It will eliminate the need for paper applications, while maintaining efficiency and improving the collection of information under the program.  Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased to note that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the Conseil de développement économique des Territoires du Nord-Ouest and the Fédération Franco-Ténoise are piloting the delivery of immigration settlement and integration services through an Integrated Service Centre for newcomers in Yellowknife. The goal of the pilot is to enhance the coordination and delivery of settlement and integration services, provide a one-stop-shop for these services, and support the success and retention of newcomer immigrants in the NWT. The Centre officially opened in December 2019 and will continue in pilot for the remainder of the 2020-2021 fiscal year. To improve partnerships with immigration stakeholders we are holding semi-annual meetings with federally-funded Settlement Service Providers and offering information sessions and resources to newcomers and employers.  Mr. Speaker, from 2009-2019, the Employer Stream of the Nominee Program has welcomed 427 nominees to the territory. With their families, the total number is 819 people attending school, shopping at our stores, and contributing to their communities.   Since 2016, the Business Stream of the Nominee Program, delivered by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment, welcomed 17 business nominees. Five are currently operating their businesses in Hay River and 12 are operating in Yellowknife. Together with their family members, these nominees bring new business services and a number of new residents to the territory.   Mr. Speaker, we continue to have requests for information from potential new residents to come to the NWT to live, work and contribute to a growing economy. Now more than ever, addressing workforce gaps and supporting the development of a strong labour market is critical to the territory’s economic future. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
655,2020-06-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-mining-week-2020,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Mining Week 2020,"Check Against Delivery   Mr. Speaker, every June the Government of the Northwest Territories, together with the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Chamber of Mines, and the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission of the NWT and Nunavut, mark mining week in our Territory.  This year will be no exception. From June 21st to 27th we will, once again, recognize this industry that is a foundation of our economy. What will be different this year is that with COVID-19 restrictions in place, Mining Week will take place entirely online. A robust calendar of social media content is being planned. A dedicated mining week page on the Mining North website will provide access to geologist-led virtual rock walks, an opportunity to engage with representatives of the NWT Geological Survey, short videos, a kids activity booklet, and links to feature stories, infographics, and a list of resources and information. For its part, Mr. Speaker, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment’s Mineral and Petroleum Resources Division will be introducing an App with two guided walking tours that we hope will encourage the public to explore our local geology. One walking tour will feature the Ranney Hill Trail, while the second will walk participants through downtown Yellowknife. Both will highlight and offer information on this region’s varied geology and the rich mining industry that it has sustained. Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to mark mining week this year, I would also like to recognize the importance of not just our diamond mines, but the exploration companies and prospectors that also make up our resource sector.   Just as it underpinned our economy before the pandemic struck, we will need mining, exploration and development to anchor our economic recovery from COVID-19. Mining and exploration has always been the biggest source of private sector jobs and income for our residents. When they return to full operations or when new projects advance they will, once again, be major buyers of products and services from NWT companies and employers to our residents. We recognize that these are trying times, and, beyond addressing health and safety concerns as a first priority, we have worked to protect the livelihood of NWT residents and the many associated businesses working in our resource industry. Like we have with all sectors of the NWT economy, we continue to consider how we can best support our mineral sector through this period of reduced or limited activity.  We initially suspended payment and work requirements to protect mineral tenure holders until the end of June.  I am happy today to announce that this relief is being extended for another three months until September 24th. This is an ongoing interim measure while we continue to work on more fulsome relief measures that require legislative change and consultation with our Indigenous partners, including those who share in the NWT’s resource revenues. We have also made changes to our Mining Incentive Program to strengthen our support this year for proposed mineral exploration projects.   Overall, priority will be given to projects that offer the greatest potential to advance both mineral exploration and economic recovery in the NWT.  Applicants are being advised to improve the attractiveness of their applications by committing to use services provided by NWT businesses and contractors to conduct most or all components of their work.  Mr. Speaker, through this COVID pandemic, our resource companies and their contractor partners have, once again, proven themselves to be strong corporate citizens. In particular, our diamond mines have worked with the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer and the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission to identify and put into practice very stringent guidelines and conditions governing the movement and interactions of their workforces. I want to thank them for their continued commitment to our territory.   Mr. Speaker, I have committed to being a strong advocate for our mining sector, and I stand by that today. I encourage all Members of the Legislative Assembly to seek out the online presentations and resources events that will mark Mining Week beginning on June 21st; and to take some time to acknowledge the opportunities and benefits which have been afforded to our Territory by our historic relationships with mining.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
656,2020-06-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-justice-during-and-beyond-covid-19,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Justice During and Beyond COVID-19,"Check Against Delivery   Like other Departments across the GNWT, the Department of Justice saw its operations, administration, programs and service delivery impacted by COVID-19. Some functions or activities were delayed as more urgent tasks took over and staff were redeployed. Yet as we begin to take stock of the last few months, there are both challenges and opportunities that have appeared. I want to speak today on the response and emerging opportunities within Court Services and Corrections.  Our correctional facilities have implemented numerous measures including modifying intake assessment procedures and practicing physical distancing. The Department worked closely with the Chief Public Health Officer on developing new protocols.  One of the first and more critical responses to COVID-19 was to reduce the number of inmates at the Correctional facilities. With support and cooperation from all those who work within the justice system including the judiciary, the Federal Public Prosecution Service and the Defense bar, there has been a strong focus on some of the core principles of both judicial interim release, or bail, and sentencing to ensure that only those who must by law be separated from society are directed to the Correctional facilities. Within the Department of Justice, we are ensuring that inmates who are eligible for temporary absence release are aware of their opportunity to apply, have support from case officers to make those applications, and will have those applications examined promptly.  The application process for temporary absences includes a thorough risk assessment because one of the goals of the Correctional Service is to preserve public safety. But it has been an opportunity for many individuals nearing the end of their formal custodial sentence to complete their period of rehabilitation outside the walls of the correctional facility. All of this work monitoring access to bail and supporting applications for temporary release, can continue past the current COVID-19 measures.  Another challenge that we are still facing is the lack of internet services available to inmates. For safety reasons, inmates do not have unrestricted access to the internet. With visits cancelled in order to reduce the risk of an outbreak in our correctional facilities, this created a very real challenge to ensuring that inmates can keep in contact with their loved ones. The Department of Justice has responded by bringing in dedicated lines that can be set up to facilitate virtual contact sessions. Looking forward, this improved connectivity could also help facilitate access to new and innovative education and programming opportunities.   Court Services have also implemented measures to allow court operations to continue in accordance with the protocols set by the Chief Public Health Officer, and as directed by the Judiciary.  To reduce the number of people present in a courtroom, hearings are only being held for urgent matters, and video appearances and videoconferencing are being utilized where feasible. Court circuits have been postponed to protect our communities. Additionally, we have reduced the hours of our Court Registries and installed depositories for the safe drop-off of court documents to protect both staff and the public.   Like other jurisdictions across the country, we are now examining how technology worked for us during the pandemic and considering how we may be able to continue to provide the Court with flexible tools so there are options available in the future. The pandemic forced an increased reliance on technology for the delivery of Court Services, but going forward we have an opportunity to decide how technology can mean better service for the people of the Northwest Territories. That can include not only the efforts made to date but also looking at where we can continue to grow, including improvements to video and other telecommunication processes and electronic filing opportunities. Mr. Speaker, Court Services and Corrections were not the only divisions within the Department of Justice impacted by COVID-19 and that worked to deliver a swift response. Lawyers in Legal Division have been called on to provide opinions and draft documents in a situation without precedent; Community Corrections has worked to deliver their programs even when our method of community engagement has been upended; Legal Registries and the Public Trustee developed new work processes and found new ways to interact with clients. In every case, we are seeing some of our challenges more acutely but also seeing opportunities for improved service delivery and innovative responses. The Department of Justice will continue to ensure health and safety first for all residents and will also continue to grow the creativity and innovation that has been a part of our response to COVID-19. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
657,2020-06-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/release-integrated-case-management-program-evaluation-and-social-return-investment-report,Government Website,Release of the Integrated Case Management Program Evaluation and Social Return on Investment Report,"Minister of Justice Caroline Wawzonek released a third-party program evaluation and social return on investment (SROI) study on the Integrated Case Management Pilot Program in Yellowknife.   The goal of the study was to determine the social value created by the ICM pilot program and how we might apply the lessons learned from it to how we continue to provide services to residents of the Northwest Territories, as well as providing those lessons to other service providers.  The study undertook a rigorous methodology of data analytics along with a careful review of case files, interview data, frontline service provider data and program participant testimony.    The conservatively calculated ratio concluded that for every dollar the GNWT invested in the ICM Program, it resulted in at least $4.50 of value.   Most of this value is returned to ICM participants (56% or $2.52) but a significant portion is returned to the GNWT as well (29% or $1.31), with  additional value generated for children and families of ICM participants (14% or $.66) as well. The ICM Program funding has been included as an on-going budget in the 2020/21 Main Estimates before the 19th Legislative Assembly for review.  The program will continue to work with its community and government partners to support program participants out of crisis and towards greater self-sufficiency. The outcomes from this study reinforce that much of the program’s success lies in the way that service is provided and how people are treated rather than solely on the availability of Pathfinders. Evidence from this study and many others show that equity, flexibility and person-centered service make up the foundation to effectively support people living with complex social challenges.  The Department of Justice, along with support from GNWT partners, is committed to making the move towards Integrated Service Delivery (ISD) a priority.  For the past four years, an inter-departmental group within the GNWT has been working on ways to move ISD forward in the territory, with a focus on the principles of person-centered service delivery.  In collaboration with its social envelope partner departments, the Department of Justice has recently staffed a Territorial Director of Integrated Service Delivery position to lead the initiative.   Quotes “As Minister of Justice, I fully support Integrated Case Management.  This program is integral in supporting the individuals and families in our community struggling the most to access the supports they need. It is not enough that government services are available; they must be accessible and delivered in a timely and flexible manner that recognizes that not everyone starts from the same point, and ensures all members of the community are treated with dignity and respect.” -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Justice Quick Facts ·       What is an SROI? An SROI is a methodology that determines the outcomes associated with a program, and then assigns values for these program outcomes to determine how much the social value has created . The goal is to calculate a ratio, or the “social return on investment”; for instance, a 3:1 ratio would indicate that for each dollar invested in the program, 3 dollars’ worth of social value are being created. ·       It was determined that for every $1 spent on ICM, $4.50 worth of social good is created, with 29% of this value returned directly to the GNWT.  ·       Demographics of participants (248 active program participants): o   54% female/46% male  o   Medium age 44 years o   55% from Yellowknife (either born and raised or been in Yellowknife more than five years) o   Self-identified identity: §  20% Inuit or Inuvialuit  §  52% First Nations  §  6% Metis §  14% non-Indigenous. ·       The study provided data to support several successes of the program so far, including:  flexibility and availability of support to participants building trust between Pathfinders and program participants and increased self-sufficiency of participants. ·       The study found that program participants feel that ICM support has been the cause of positive changes in their lives. ·       The study found that the majority of other service providers found that ICM alleviated pressure from their workload. ·       All interviewees for the study were randomly selected by the contractor by using a statistical technique to ensure the interviewees were part of key clusters of similar program participants.  This helped to ensure a balanced cross section of perspectives. ·       Of the 217 participants that had significant interactions with the ICM program, 80% are ·       Indigenous, 54% are female, the median age is 44, and 99 have children (with a total of 203 children of participants). ·       ICM participants face significant challenges when they enter the program—80% are unemployed, 65% are residential school survivors or had family that attended residential schools, 70% experience mental health issues, and 53% struggle with substance use.   Media Contact Sue Glowach Senior Communications Advisor Department of Justice Government of the Northwest Territories  Email: sue_glowach@gov.nt.ca "

659,2020-06-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-emergency-management-organization-and-community-and-indigenous-engagement,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: The Emergency Management Organization and Community and Indigenous  Engagement on COVID-19 Response,"Check Against Delivery   Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis on a level the world has not seen in generations. Taking action to slow its spread and protect public health has required leadership from all levels of government. Today I would like to highlight the work that has been done by the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs and the Emergency Management Organization in response to COVID-19. The Department of Municipal and Community Affairs, or MACA, has the mandated responsibility for public safety within the Northwest Territories. To accomplish this, MACA  houses the Emergency Management Organization, which provides guidance and coordination for our Government and our partners to respond to territorial emergencies. Each government department and external agency continues to be responsible for its own operations and decisions, but by having members of each department attend the meetings, the Emergency Management Organization provides a forum for discussing what they are doing and making sure their plans align in a coordinated manner.  The Emergency Management Organization, or EMO, is also responsible for making sure that all members have good, timely information about the full scope of the emergency response and for identifying potential gaps or the need for additional resources.  Typically, the focus for the EMO would be emergencies like floods or fires that only affect a portion of the Northwest Territories and are over relatively quickly. The COVID-19 pandemic is different in that it has affected everybody in the territory, has gone on for many months, and projected to last for some time. This has required the EMO to take on additional tasks and responsibilities that are unique to this pandemic.  Specifically the EMO has established and maintained all isolation centres in the four regional centres – Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River, and Fort Smith. In addition, EMO is supporting check points at airports and highways to keep track of who is entering the territory and make sure they know about our public health requirements.  The EMO also supports the 8-1-1 Support Line. Residents can dial this one easy number and select one of three options - general information on COVID-19 in the NWT, Protect NWT to raise issues of compliance for the Enforcement Task force and the third to inquire about available service and support in Communities. EMO operators answer the calls on community supports.  The EMO is also working to obtain and distribute Personal Protective Equipment for non- medical essential workers, non-government organizations, community governments and Indigenous governments. Community and Indigenous governments have supported these efforts by completing needs assessments to identify their personal protective equipment needs.  Mr. Speaker, community and Indigenous governments have also been affected by COVID-19 and have needed to adjust their operations and how they serve their residents. Since mid-March the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs has worked with Senior Administration Officers and Band Managers to identify and monitor impacts to communities as a result of COVID-19, share information, update community emergency plans and ensure continuity of emergency and essential services. These have included practical challenges such as holding council meetings remotely and making the required changes to bylaws to do so and helping community governments understand how the Chief Public Health Officer orders affect them.  As well, I have held weekly virtual town hall meetings with community and Indigenous government leaders since the beginning of the pandemic to provide a forum to hear and answer their concerns. Other Ministers and GNWT officials have also joined me at these meetings to answer questions leaders have had about specific topics.  Our government is extremely grateful for the support municipal and indigenous governments have provided residents since the beginning of this pandemic.  These governments are doing all they can to assist residents and we would not be where we are without their support.  I would also like to say thank you to all staff from the various departments who are involved with the EMO, all those who have voluntarily redeployed from other departments and agencies to support the response efforts, regional MACA staff who are continuing their direct engagement with communities, our management team who have worked non-stop since this began and, all those supporting the EMO and health efforts. Only by working together, to identify and address gaps in our plans, have we been able to keep this pandemic at bay and protect the residents of the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, we have faced many emergencies in the past, but none have measured in comparison to COVID-19. This pandemic is not over, but by each of us doing our part to abide by the Chief Public Health Officer orders, and all stakeholders working together through the Emergency Management Organization, we will be better prepared as we plan for a potential second wave in the fall.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
660,2020-06-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-covid-19-travel-restrictions,Government Website,Diane Thom: COVID-19 Travel Restrictions,"Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 has affected all areas of social and economic activity in the Northwest Territories and around the world. As the pandemic has evolved and jurisdictions have been able to manage its spread, all governments are looking at the public health measures that have been put in place and are continuing to adjust them.  One area of significant interest to our government and to all people and communities in the Northwest Territories is travel.  Due to the restrictions the Chief Public Health Officer placed on travel early on, we have been fortunate in the territory to have only seen five cases of COVID-19 so far. While our strategy of restricting travel has clearly been a success when it comes to protecting public health, we have to recognize that it is a serious step and there are some significant legal limits and considerations that need to be respected. One of those legal limits is the requirement to respect the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees on freedom of mobility.  The Charter gives all Canadians the right to travel freely throughout Canada, and the Government of the Northwest Territories does not have the legal authority to override that.  Although this means that our government cannot close the borders to Canadian residents, it does not prevent us from placing restrictions and conditions on travel by people once they are in the Northwest Territories.  This is what we have done under a public health order issued by the Chief Public Health Officer.  Under the current orders, all travelers entering the NWT are greeted at a checkpoint by a Border Officer.  The Border Officer collects their information, and if they do not meet an identified exemption, informs them of the NWT’s public health travel restrictions – including the requirement for anyone entering to self-isolate for 14 days.  Travellers have the opportunity to voluntarily turn around. If they choose not to, they are informed that they must seek an exceptional circumstances exemption, and immediately self-isolate if they wish to proceed further in the Northwest Territories.  This is a shift in how the current order was being implemented, Mr. Speaker.  Before May 29, border officials asked people to turn around and return to their destination if they did not fit an existing exemption in order to meet our objectives. Following legal developments in Southern Canada challenging similar actions in Newfoundland and Labrador, we realized we needed to take steps to more closely align implementation of our order with the mobility provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  When I, or the Premier, have spoken about travel restrictions, we have spoken about different aspects of the same order.  The bottom line is that our government cannot prevent people from entering the Northwest Territories, but we can restrict and prohibit their movements once they are in the Northwest Territories.  Travel restrictions are a legitimate and necessary measure to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact on Northwest Territories residents, communities and the health care system.  We will continue to maintain travel restrictions so long as they are necessary to protect our residents.  We will also continue the requirement for people to self-isolate in one of the four regional self-isolation communities, if they have entered from outside the territory. Our plan is to continue to cover the costs for people who need to access one of our self-isolation centres for Northwest Territories residents, but we will be asking 	non-NWT residents to cover the cost of their stay themselves. Mr. Speaker, we recognize that our public health measures have to adjust to meet the realities on the ground.  As the threat of the pandemic changes, we will review our measures and adjust them to reflect the current situation.  We will also continue to strive to make sure our orders are in line with all the necessary legal requirements and that the way we describe them are clear and accurate.  COVID-19 is a dynamic situation and how we have responded has changed.  It will continue to change, Mr. Speaker, and so will the way we describe our response publicly.  We recognize that this can be confusing for people, but we will commit to doing a better job to explain those changes as soon as we make them, and speak about them as clearly and directly as possible.  We have two different changes coming on Friday, Mr. Speaker.  One change is to the travel restrictions that I have been speaking about this afternoon.  As I have said, these changes will line up better with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and will more clearly address leisure travel within the territory.  The second change will be the implementation of phase two of relaxing restrictions under our Emerging Wisely plan.  I know that all Members, and all residents of the Northwest Territories, are looking forward to phase two.  We will be briefing Members on phase two tomorrow, Mr. Speaker, and making a public announcement on Friday afternoon. While we are able to start revising our public health measures as the pandemic evolves, Mr. Speaker, I want to remind all residents that COVID-19 is not over and we must still be cautious, and follow the direction and guidance issued by the Chief Public Health Officer to keep our territory safe.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
661,2020-06-10,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/media-statement-statement-clarifying-public-health-restrictions-travel-within-nwt,Government Website,Media Statement: Statement Clarifying Public Health Restrictions on Travel Within the NWT,"Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories, Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services, and Dr. Kami Kandola, Chief Public Health Officer issued the following joint statement today to clarify the existing Public Health Order – COVID-19 Travel Restrictions and Self-Isolation Protocol:  “Travel restrictions are a legitimate and necessary measure implemented by the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact on Northwest Territories (NWT) residents, communities and the health care system.  “While the CPHO does not have the authority to prohibit Canadians from entering the NWT, she does have the authority to restrict travel within our borders.  “Under the current orders, and in an effort to ensure the orders are adhered to, all travelers entering the NWT are greeted at a checkpoint by a Border Officer.  “The Border Officer will collect their information, and if they do not meet an identified exemption, the Border Officer will inform them of the NWT’s public health travel restrictions – including the requirement for anyone entering to self-isolate for 14 days.  “Travellers have the opportunity to voluntarily turn around. If they choose not to, they are informed that they must seek an exceptional circumstances exemption, and immediately self-isolate if they wish to proceed further in the NWT.  “This is a shift in how the order was being implemented through May 29, and reflects an effort to more closely align implementation of the order with the mobility provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  “Prior to May 29, border officials asked people to turn around and return to their destination if they did not fit an existing exemption in order to meet our objectives.  “The process outlined above is an interim measure and the CPHO and her team are working diligently on amendments to our travel restriction and self-isolation order to more transparently protect mobility rights under the Charter.  ‘In an interview with CBC Television on Monday, June 8, Premier Cochrane was asked if tourism was “off the table” for the NWT. The Premier answered that tourism was on the table, so long as people self-isolated for 14 days, which is consistent with how CPHO orders are currently being implemented.  ‘While the GNWT approach to tourism during the pandemic is still developing, the NWT is expecting to establish a travel bubble with Nunavut as part of its new travel orders and will be encouraging tourism by residents of both territories.  ‘The Premiers comments were made in the context of the current understanding of Charter limitations on the CPHO’s powers and the intention to promote tourism among NWT and Nunavut residents.  ‘While it will respect the right of any Canadian resident to enter the territory, the GNWT will still be enforcing the CPHO’s legitimate orders to restrict travel within the territory, including restrictions on leisure travel within the territory, to ensure that the health of all NWT residents and communities is protected.  “As stated in the House yesterday, new travel orders are expected to be implemented with Phase 2 of the Emerging Wisely Plan and when details of those orders are finalized, they will be thoroughly explained to NWT residents and the media.”"

Both extensions will take effect as of June 10, 2020 and expire on June 23, 2020. Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Kami Kandola.  Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. NWT residents entering the NWT are still required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith before travelling to their home community.  In order to ensure we can maintain ongoing support of the Public Heath orders, including checkpoints and isolation centres, as well as the ability to respond to any potential new cases and the impacts that might arise, it is necessary to continue to maintain a Public Health Emergency and State of Emergency.  While the Northwest Territories is currently in containment mode, with no evidence of community spread and all cases recovered, the situation can change quickly without carefully managing the continued response.    Nationwide spread is the biggest risk of expanding spread within the Northwest Territories and Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably across Canada.  These extensions reflect the need to remain vigilant and swiftly respond to any changes to the current situation in the Northwest Territories. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continues to enhance our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an ongoing effort to protect the health of the residents of the Northwest Territories.

666,2020-06-09,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-aurora-college-covid-19-response-and-beyond,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Aurora College COVID-19 Response and Beyond,"Check Against Delivery   Mr. Speaker, when students at Aurora College left for March break they were unaware of the uncertainty that the pandemic would bring to so many aspects of their lives, including if they would remain on track to achieve their education and career goals. I would like to share with you today some of the challenges and innovative solutions that the team at Aurora College implemented to support their students and their communities. When the pandemic hit the Northwest Territories, all Aurora College programming was temporarily suspended while the College team planned and executed a fundamental shift in how they would teach. In a two week period, Aurora College transitioned from classroom-based learning to a distance learning format for all of its full-time certificate, diploma and degree programs. Through innovation and determination on the part of instructors, the majority of students remained on track to complete their semester. Mr. Speaker, students who previously relied on access to a shared computer lab faced the challenge of not having the technology typically required to learn from a distance. In response to this challenge, Aurora College collaborated with Computers for Schools to provide computers to students who identified they needed one to continue their studies.   All throughout these changes to  the program delivery, the College continued to consider how suspended and cancelled programs might restart, and the Aurora College team stayed in touch and followed up with affected students to support their continued educational journey ensuring continued relationships between the students and staff during this difficult time of transition.  Mr. Speaker, in addition to a monumental shift in their teaching method, Aurora College was also able to assist with the broader Government of the Northwest Territories’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Student housing in Fort Smith was repurposed to accommodate travellers returning to the Northwest Territories who needed to isolate for 14 days. In addition, the Aurora College Centre for Mine and Industry Training facility became the solution to address the need for a drive-through COVID-19 testing site for the Department of Health and Social Services.  At the Yellowknife-North Slave campus, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing staff stepped-up to inventory medical equipment and supplies used in that program and designated for use by health authorities if required. Aurora College engaged with the Department of Health and Social Services to determine how current students in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Practical Nursing Diploma, and Personal Support Worker programs could play a role in the emergency response at health care facilities. These students also participated in the emergency response either through casual employment or through their scheduled practicum. There have also been engagements with Education, Culture and Employment to determine how students in the Early Childhood Development program could support the re-opening of day care facilities under emergency conditions.  Mr. Speaker, at the Inuvik Campus, the Arts, Crafts and Technology Micro-Manufacturing Centre has been using 3D printers to make mask tension relievers for hospital workers, and developing prototypes for door openers that allow you to open a door with your arm instead of hand. In addition, it has all the supplies and is on stand-by to produce face shields should they be required. As well, the single-student housing facility is being provided as a temporary solution to address the emergency isolation needs of the town’s vulnerable population.  Mr. Speaker, as the College plans for how to deliver programming in the fall of 2020, their primary responsibility remains the health and safety of students, staff and residents. In response to the Government of the Northwest Territories’ Emerging Wisely reopening plan and to its ongoing commitment to student success, the majority of Aurora College programs and courses offered in the 2020 fall semester will be delivered entirely by distance learning. Acknowledging the importance of hands-on and face-to-face learning, Aurora College continues to determine how and when critical in-person programming can happen based on advice from Office of the Chief Public Health Officer and the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission. Mr. Speaker, all of the challenges faced and changes made have strengthened the College and shown that the institution is ready and capable of making the changes necessary to transform into a polytechnic university. The transformation remains on target and is more important than ever for the Northwest Territories.   There are wide ranging benefits to establishing a polytechnic university in the Northwest Territories, many of which could contribute to the social and economic recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The combined short and long-term benefits could make the transformation a focal point for drawing post-COVID related investment, primarily from the Government of Canada, but it may also draw attention from wide-ranging sources.  Mr. Speaker, Aurora College currently serves a student population that is 75 per cent Indigenous and oversees several academic and research programs in partnership with Indigenous governments. Engaging our Indigenous partners in a meaningful way in transformation is critical to its success. That is why I have written to Indigenous leaders to collaborate on an approach to how and when they are engaged in the transformation based on the principles of United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It is also important to highlight that what we are building is a post-secondary institution that reflects the values and interests of our residents. Beyond the simple mechanics of economic stimulus, residents must be inspired by new short and long-term opportunities. Mr. Speaker, in closing I would like to say that despite the additional challenges Aurora College students have faced, it has been heartening to see their continued dedication to advancing their education. I also have to congratulate all of the Aurora College graduates of 2020 who, in the face of adversity, successfully completed their programs. They should be very proud of their achievement. Their commitment to success will serve them well throughout their lives.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
667,2020-06-09,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-covid-19,Government Website,Shane Thompson: COVID 19,"Check Against Delivery I would like to begin today, Mr. Speaker, by commending the courage and resolve of our front line staff responding to this unprecedented public health emergency. From medical personnel, to the folks stocking shelves and keeping the grocery stores open, to the water and fuel delivery staff and the officers in our communities and at the borders – I am grateful to you all for this selfless work. It is because you are at work that others, in fact, much of the Government of the Northwest Territories workforce, have been able to work remotely through this crisis.  Mr. Speaker, it has indeed been a challenge with so many people working from home – many with added responsibilities – to ensure each department can continue to fulfill its critical functions. From processing applications for land leases, to issuing permits for wildlife and forestry, and keeping the lights on across the Northwest Territories, has required extra time and attention.  For the Northwest Territories Power Corporation, this includes new protocols for entering communities and performing emergency work or required maintenance. Importantly, this also means working with the Emergency Measures Office to acquire Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to keep those essential workers safe. COVID-19 has changed the way we work, but the work to protect our land, water and air must continue. Staff at the departments of Lands and Environment and Natural Resources has worked diligently to develop new protocols to ensure the important work of protecting our environment and managing land use can continue in a way that is safe for our employees and residents. This includes new ways of carrying out inspections; research and environmental monitoring while maintaining physical distance and respecting the public health orders that are in place. Environmental assessments are a critical part of our regulatory system in the Northwest Territories, and involve a high level of coordination between departments, agencies and Indigenous governments. Despite the challenges caused by the pandemic, I am proud to say we are on track to meet the legislated timeline of June 06, 2020, to complete our response the Review Board on the Diavik Environmental Assessment.   As you know, Mr. Speaker, many northerners are going out on the land in response to COVID-19.  As a result, Environment and Natural Resources and Lands officers have increased wildlife monitoring, enforcement activities and inspections.  And of course, the way we fight fires this summer will be unlike any other season before. Environment and Natural Resources has been preparing for months, reviewing best practices in other jurisdictions and adapting our operations to reduce the risks to our staff and our communities. On top of their regular duties, many of our Environment and Natural Resources and Lands officers have also stepped up to support the larger Government of the Northwest Territories-wide effort to combat the spread of COVID-19. These efforts are critical to keeping our families and communities safe and healthy. Between Environment and Natural Resources and Lands, well over 70 staff have taken on extra duties or lent their expertise to other departments over the last couple of months, notably the Emergency Management Organization, the COVID Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce and at border crossing check stations. The level of collaboration and cooperation throughout the Government of the Northwest Territories has been incredible. At Lands alone, a full 25 per cent of the department’s employees are on redeployment or reassignment as part of the COVID-19 efforts. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to give a special shout out to Environment and Natural Resources’ Taiga Environmental Laboratory. The lab has been hard at work in recent weeks producing hand sanitizer for our frontline workers, including the officers I just mentioned.  Getting the supplies and the okay from Health Canada to produce took a lot of time and effort but it is truly paying off. At last count, the lab has produced more than 4,000 litres of hand sanitizer! Mr. Speaker, the physical distancing and isolation measures put in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 have created new and very real economic stress on Northwest Territories residents, families, businesses, Indigenous governments and communities.  That’s why the Department of Lands is helping to ease some of the burden by waiving rent for leaseholders on public land, for the fiscal year 2020-2021.  Looking forward, we hope to be able to open our regional and local offices to the public very soon under appropriate health order protocols. And that’s not all. To help customers impacted by the crisis, Northwest Territories Power Corporation removed all load limiters, suspended disconnections and collection activity.   At the same time, Northwest Territories Power Corporation is coordinating their response with its counterparts across the country and with the territorial Emergency Management Organization.  Through it all, Northwest Territories Power Corporation is keeping its workers safe while maintaining optimum service levels for Northwest Territories residents.

The two-page document covers topics on everyone’s mind like mass-testing, rapid testing, and asymptomatic testing – providing a rationale for the territory’s decisions on each.  Testing is the foundation of good pandemic response – allowing health professionals to identify, trace, and isolate cases and contacts to minimize community risk.  From the start, the Northwest Territories has had one of the most aggressive testing strategies in the country – testing those without travel connections and expanding symptoms before other jurisdictions.  The territory will continue to get supplies in-place as test traffic is lower to continue meeting that standard as additional waves of COVID-19 arrive.     Quote “As we continue our pandemic response, residents want to see exactly how we’ll continue to rise to this challenge. This short document clears up some misconceptions, outlines our approach, and explains how it will keep us safe. And it underscores just how important it is to stay vigilant – especially as we ease our public health measures – because we’re in this for the long-haul, and now is the time to prepare.”  -Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services  Quick Facts  The Northwest Territories is testing at a rate of 466 per 10,000 in population.  Asymptomatic testing will not be applied on a wide-scale basis – only with priority populations like health care workers entering the territory to reduce risk.  This is because asymptomatic testing offers too much risk of false negatives and a false sense of security which then encourages riskier behaviours.  GeneXpert rapid testing kits are arriving and being set up in the territory. Mine sites in the Northwest Territories have their own testing strategies they are using to screen workers.

676,2020-06-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-housing-and-homelessness-response-covid-19,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Housing and Homelessness Response to COVID-19,"Mr. Speaker, we recognize that supporting vulnerable residents in need of housing or at risk of homelessness across the Northwest Territories is an essential part of the overall response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.  The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation has been working to ensure that we meet the needs of our residents during this difficult and challenging time.  The need for social distancing due to COVID-19 had a significant impact on how we support our residents and highlighted the need for all of us to work together, respect one another and be sources of hope in these trying times. To support meeting the housing and shelter needs of Northwest Territories residents during this pandemic, the Government of the Northwest Territories announced $5 million to support initiatives that recognize that vulnerable residents have limited ability to self-isolate safely.  This included $1.4 million to create housing for persons at risk or persons experiencing homelessness to self-isolate, and $3.6 million to bring on stream up to approximately 130 units across the Northwest Territories that were either available for occupancy or in need of renovations to meet the core housing needs.  Now that these units are no longer required by the Emergency Management Organization, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation is in the process of re-allocating these units to the Corporation’s rental programs:  Public housing, market rental and affordable rental or to support homeownership.  The re-allocation of these units will help in alleviating overcrowding in smaller communities.  Some 60 of these units are available for immediate allocation.  The introduction of these units will decrease the waiting lists across the NWT and make us better prepared should there be a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Speaker, we also recognized that some residents were facing economic challenges due to this virus.  To meet that need, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation enhanced the Transitional Rent Supplement Program by extending the program to August, streamlining the application process, and simplified requirements for participants.   Where there were approximately 40 program participants last year, this program is now helping almost 150 households. One of the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic is that the sudden loss of income could lead to residents being at risk of homelessness.  In anticipation of that, we increased the budget for the Homelessness Assistance Fund from $125,000 to $300,000.  This program provides financial assistance for the private rental market for people to find stable housing.  We have been working to ensure that these applications are processed as quickly as possible, as we know that these times are extremely stressful for our residents. Mr. Speaker, we have been working with community partners to access buildings to help serve as isolation centres for those vulnerable people who are at greater risks to contract COVID-19.  Under this action, we leased Aspen Apartments from the federal government that has provided 36 units in Yellowknife; and we have accommodated up to 18 people to be sheltered and experiencing homelessness at the North Country Inn in Hay River.  During this pandemic period, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation continues to be accessible to residents even with the realities of many working remotely.  As such, emergency hotlines were set up for homelessness assistance, emergency repair and access to the Transitional Rent Supplement Program. Mr. Speaker, as we begin recovery, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation will be an important contributor to the economic recovery of the Northwest Territories.  We will be working with communities to ensure that construction, renovation and repair work is done in a safe and considerate manner and bring in much needed economic benefits to our small communities. Lastly, even though we have entered into Stage 1 of the pandemic recovery plan, I would like to remind our tenants that the risks posed by COVID-19 are not over.  I know that with the easing of some social distancing, we want to gather and spend time with friends and families, but we all need to follow the directions of the Chief Public Health Officer.  So, let us  be considerate, be helpful, be kind, and keep washing our hands. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take the opportunity to thank all Northwest Territories Housing Corporation staff and the Local Housing Authorities who have been creative, flexible and responsive throughout this pandemic.  They have gone above and beyond to provide direct, appropriate assistance to all residents of the Northwest Territories. Your time, energy and countless hours are extremely appreciated.   Mahsi, Mr. Speaker."
677,2020-06-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-inuvialuit-day-and-national-indigenous-peoples-day,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Inuvialuit Day and National Indigenous Peoples Day,"Mr. Speaker, I know that renewing our government’s relationship with Indigenous governments is important to all Members. That is why the 19th Legislative Assembly has established settling and implementing treaty, land, resources and self-government agreements as one of its priorities. We have also made it a priority to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.   On June 5th each year, we commemorate Inuvialuit Day to celebrate the signing of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement in 1984.  In many ways, this agreement led the way for the future negotiation of land, resources and self-government agreements in the Northwest Territories and, perhaps, all of Canada.  The Inuvialuit Final Agreement was the first comprehensive land claim agreement north of the 60th parallel and only the second of its kind in Canada.   The Final Agreement designates over 90,000 square kilometres of land as the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and includes close to 13,000 square kilometres of subsurface ownership and certain wildlife harvesting rights within the region. The agreement also established the Inuvialuit Development Corporation to support Inuvialuit self-reliance by providing a solid economic base that allows them to participate fully in the Canadian economy.  Just as importantly, the Final Agreement gave Inuvialuit a guaranteed right to participate in important decisions affecting the Inuvialuit Settlement Region: it established the Inuvialuit Game Council, ensured Inuvialuit participation on co-management boards, and led to the creation of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation.  To this day, the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation remains one of this government’s most important and valued partners. The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation was the first Indigenous government to join with our government in signing on to the Devolution Agreement-in-Principle in January 2011, and their support and participation in the negotiation of the final agreement was invaluable to our government.  The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation continues to be a strong supporter and ally as a member of the Intergovernmental Council on Lands and Resource Management.   Following Devolution, the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation and our government jointly advocated to Canada for a start to Arctic offshore oil and gas accord negotiations, as called for in the Devolution Agreement. These negotiations began in the spring of 2019, and the GNWT and the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation share an interest in bringing more decision-making authority to the North as part of the accord.  Earlier this year we celebrated Gwich’in Day. Later this summer, we celebrate two additional important landmarks for the people of the Northwest Territories. Sahtu Day on June 23rd will mark the 27th anniversary of the signing of the Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement, and August 4th will mark the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Tłı̨chǫ Agreement.  We look forward to recognizing these accomplishments with our Indigenous government partners, and continuing to build on the vision of reconciliation expressed in these agreements.   On June 21st, we will also celebrate National Indigenous People’s Day. This is a day to celebrate the first peoples of Canada, including the rich and diverse cultures of the Dene, Inuit and Métis peoples.  National Indigenous People’s Day also serves as a reminder that we are stronger, and more successful, when our public government works in collaboration with Indigenous governments throughout the Northwest Territories.  Mr. Speaker, our collaboration with the Inuvialuit, the Sahtu Secretariat Incorporated and the Tłı̨chǫ are just three examples of the government-to-government relationships we are building with all Indigenous governments of the Northwest Territories. We look forward to continuing to build and strengthen these particularly important relationships.  The future of the Northwest Territories depends on partnerships. One of the things that the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated is that we are all connected. Everybody has been affected by the pandemic, and all governments have had to work hard together to help protect the health of Northwest Territories residents.    Indigenous governments are a critical partner for us and that is why our government has been meeting weekly with them throughout the pandemic to discuss our response and how we can work together to serve our people. While this pandemic will not last, I look forward to continued close collaboration between the Government of the Northwest Territories and Indigenous governments in the years to come.   We ask all Members to join me in congratulating the Inuvialuit people on the 36th anniversary of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Simpson and the NWT Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) on June 3, 2020 to discuss priorities and planning for the upcoming 2020-2021 school year. Planning for re-entry into schools in the fall is ongoing, with ECE and education bodies actively working together on a coordinated, system-wide approach for the upcoming school year. This planning follows the detailed criteria provided by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) on how to safely reopen schools. How education is delivered will be different for each school and community, based on factors such as school size and layout, access to technology, and the number and ages of students and staff. It is likely that individual schools will be adjusting student transportation, food programs and even scheduling, depending on their ability to accommodate the public health recommendations. Education leaders have agreed on the following priorities for the 2020-2021 school year: Maintaining the health and safety of students, staff and communities Starting the school year on time Maximizing in-person learning, to the extent possible Seeking equity across regions Maintaining financial supports to schools Education bodies will be taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020, which could require a return to increased public health restrictions. All schools are working to have their detailed risk assessment plans for reopening submitted to the OCPHO in June 2020. A more formal outline of the 2020-21 school year will be available once these plans are approved. Quotes: “The upcoming 2020-2021 school year will not be a return to normal for education staff and students in the NWT. In order to ensure the health and safety of our students and educational staff, schools will be taking strong action to meet the recommendations of the Chief Public Health Officer, while providing a blended learning approach that will prioritize in-person learning wherever possible, and support at-home distance learning where required.” 	-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment “With guidance from the Department of Education, Culture and Employment and the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association, all NWT Education Bodies are presently evaluating their capacity to deliver a quality education program while meeting the public health recommendations. It’s a daunting task, but I am confident that by continuing to work together and keeping our sights set on the priorities we agreed upon, we will be ready to welcome students back for the upcoming school year.” 	- Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   Related Link: Emerging Wisely – Path to Eased Public Health Restrictions Media inquiries: Cabinet Communications 	Government of the Northwest Territoriespresssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

Under the Tourism Act, all tourism operators providing tourism services in the NWT are required to have a valid Tourism Operator Licence (TOL) with prescribed support documents including proof of insurance. For this fiscal year, licenced tourism operators wishing to renew or significantly amend their TOL will not be charged. Nor will fees be collected for significant renewal applications.  Through amendments to its tourism regulations, the Department of ITI will also grant a temporary waiver on the insurance requirements required by the Tourism Act provided an operator is unable to conduct tourism activities.   Quote: “In the wake of COVID-19 the landscape of tourism in the Northwest Territories has changed.  The tourism sector was one of the first hit by the pandemic and will likely be amongst the last to recover from its effects.  By allowing tourism operators to keep their TOLs alive without cost or cancellation, we hope to demonstrate support for the tourism industry in these challenging times and to foster a quicker recovery in this sector when it is able.” - Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism, and Investment      Quick facts ·       The Tourism Act requires TOL holders to maintain a minimum of $1 million liability insurance at all times.   ·       $29,225 will be returned to operators who have already paid their 2020/21 TOLs fees. ·       Tourism operators who provide tourism activities to NWT residents are still required to have valid insurance for their activities on file so their businesses are in good standing with ITI.   Related links ·       Tourism Act ·       Tourism Act Regulations   For media requests contact:  Drew Williams Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment  Government of the Northwest Territories Drew_Williams@gov.nt.ca "

You’ll Need to Bring Your Own Non-Medical Mask,"Effective June 8th, 2020, Northwest Territories residents must bring their own non-medical masks to their flights in order to comply with Transport Canada regulations. Supplies of masks provided to airlines operating out of Yellowknife by the Department of Health and Social Services as a courtesy will soon be depleted. The requirement to provide your own non-medical mask is consistent with practices in other destinations across Canada. Passengers will not be allowed to board their flight without demonstrating that their non-medical face mask will adequately cover their mouths and noses for the duration of their flight with durable material like cotton. This is also consistent with broader public health recommendations. Dr. Kami Kandola, the NWT’s Chief Public Health Officer, strongly recommends non-medical masks for use in public places – especially those where maintaining physical distance of two metres is difficult. While a non-medical face mask does not protect the wearer in the same way a medical mask would, it does prevent your respiratory droplets from contaminating other people or landing on surfaces. An inventory of non-medical face mask manufacturers across the territory has been established for those wishing to purchase them. If you prefer to make them at home, they can be made with common materials and with-or-without sewing. Here are some tips on how.

The Final Report is split into two volumes with three main sections: Section 1 presents a comprehensive person and community-centered understanding of the crisis of violence experienced by Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ+ persons.   Section 2 takes a deeper look at topics that present distinct issues or perspectives.  It also describes opportunities to demonstrate, within a distinctions-based approach, how culture, health, security and justice can create particular challenges for specific groups, institutions, geographies, or other circumstances,. Section 3 focuses on different models of healing and Indigenous-led best practices. The report ends with the presentation of the 231 Calls for Justice covering a wide range of topics and themes including, culture, health and wellness and human security.  The Government of the Northwest Territories prepared an initial response to the Calls for Justice entitled Doing Our Part. While the GNWT did not respond to specific Calls for Justice in Doing Our Part, we provided a list of thematic sections related to each of the Calls for Justice highlighting the work we are already doing or can build upon.  We also set out a number of high-level questions that will need to be considered more fully by our government.  Then-Minister Cochrane tabled this report in the Legislative Assembly on August 22nd, 2019. To date, the GNWT remains the only jurisdiction in Canada that has prepared a response to the final report. The GNWT has also made a commitment to work with Canada on the development of the National Action Plan in a coordinated manner that involves all stakeholders.  The Minister of Crown-Indigenous Affairs had committed to having the national action plan developed by June 2020.  While that deadline has been pushed back due to circumstances related to COVID-19, the GNWT remains committed to working to move this work forward.  The GNWT has set up an interdepartmental working group for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls to coordinate our response to the Calls for Justice.  This working group is chaired by the Special Advisor to the Minister Responsible for the Status of Women and includes appointed representatives from the departments of Executive and Indigenous Affairs, Health and Social Services, Justice, Housing Corporation and Education, Culture and Employment.  Other departments are invited to meetings or asked for input, as required.  Mr. Speaker, the GNWT is aware that we cannot do this work alone.  Our government is committed to working with all Northerners and with partners across Canada to support the work needed to address systemic causes of violence, inequality and racism, so that Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ+ people are able to feel safe and empowered in our territory and in our country.  According to Statistics Canada, the Northwest Territories has the second highest rate of violence against women in the country.  As a government, we need to take the necessary steps to address the systemic causes of violence, inequality and racism that contribute to the problem in the Northwest Territories.  The Final Report shares stories we all need to hear: stories about someone’s sister, someone’s niece, someone’s mother, someone’s child.  Sadly, Indigenous women and girls in the NWT continue to live these stories.  Trying to put the pain that loved ones and communities deal with into perspective is difficult.  The NWT may be large geographically, but the events in one community can affect us all. That is why it is so important that we work together to address the ongoing violence being experienced by Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQ+ people.  It will require many people willing to work together to explore ways in which we can end violence that continues to have a negative impact on the lives of many NWT residents.  I recognize that change will not happen overnight but change MUST happen. Mr. Speaker, violence against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ+ people is not an individual problem or an issue only for certain communities.  This violence is rooted in systemic factors woven in the fabric of Canadian society like economic, social and political marginalization, as well as racism, discrimination and misogyny.  As the previous Minister Responsible for the Status of Women so eloquently put it and I quote “We must keep this issue at the forefront of people’s minds and consistently convey another truth: that Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ+ individuals are valued, loved and worthy of justice.” To conclude, I would like to acknowledge the courage and strength shown by those who agreed to share their “truths” with the National Commission.  I offer my thoughts, my prayers and my gratitude.

It is only been in the last week or so that things are finally starting to warm up. Hot weather is predicted through June and July with temperatures well above normal. These are prime conditions for wildfire. As of this week, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources has responded to one wildfire in the Northwest Territories.  This fire is suspected to be human-caused and is under investigation.  Mr. Speaker, it is critical that residents use extreme caution with campfires while out on the land. This is especially important early in the season when the land is often dry. People planning to do spring brush or grass burning must get a burn permit, and make sure they have water and tools on hand to put it out. Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 presents some unique challenges this fire season. Staff at Environment and Natural Resources have been preparing for months, learning from other parts of the country whose fire seasons began weeks or months before our own, and establishing best practices to keep our fire crews and communities safe.  Large fires require a large response, Mr. Speaker, many people working closely together, eating and sleeping in close quarters. Physical distancing is not possible on your way to a fire, whether you are traveling by aircraft or by vehicle. Setting up pumps and pulling hose around a fire needs teamwork and people working alongside one another. That is why we have put in place new health and safety measures for our wildfire operations this year. Fitness testing and training and camp protocols have been modified to limit group sizes; new briefing formats keep face-to-face interactions to a minimum; and surfaces are more frequently cleaned and sanitized. We are also monitoring the health of our fire crews and staff on a daily basis. Mr. Speaker, wildfires also produce a lot of smoke which can be hard on residents with existing health conditions. In a worst case scenario, wildfires can require community evacuations. Physical distancing would be extremely challenging while evacuating large numbers of people, and add additional stress on communities, residents and emergency responders. This is why we have adjusted our wildfire response strategies this year to take into account the additional challenges of COVID-19. To limit the risks to our fire crews and communities, we will aim to catch fires early. We will also be more aggressive in how we fight fires to keep them as small as possible. As I mentioned, large fires require a large response, and we want to keep the number of crews on a fire to a minimum, and try to avoid bringing in crews from outside the Northwest Territories. Under certain conditions, we may also need to put in place fire bans to reduce human caused fires and consider restricting burning when the fire danger is moderate or higher. Mr. Speaker, it is important to recognize fire is an important and necessary part of the forest ecosystem. Historically, Environment and Natural Resources responds to less than half of the wildfires on the landscape in any given fire season. Each fire that is actioned increases the risk of fire in future years. That is because forest fuels build up to a point where controlling new fires becomes more challenging, and can result in greater human, financial and ecological impacts. While more fires will be actioned in 2020, not every fire will be fought. Environment and Natural Resources has reviewed the additional COVID-related measures for the 2020 season with the Chief Public Health Officer and the Departments of Municipal and Community Affairs and Health and Social Services, which are in support of the plan. Environment and Natural Resources will continue to work collaboratively throughout the season to ensure a coordinated effort. Mr. Speaker, it is so important, perhaps now more than ever, that each one of us does our part to prevent wildfire. This year, Environment and Natural Resources launched a new contest to encourage residents to FireSmart their properties while maintaining physical distance from others. I encourage Northwest Territories residents to take part. Clearing brush, raking leaves, even cutting your lawn, can help keep your home safe. Finally, I would just like to remind everyone to be careful on the land. Do not let your campfire become a wildfire. By reducing the number of fires in the Northwest Territories this summer, we can all help keep our fire crews and our communities stay safe and healthy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

System accreditation is an important and major milestone for our health and social services system. It signals that our system meets fundamental national standards of practice, policies and programs. Our commitment to high quality health care should reassure residents that they are receiving care and services to national standards. Accreditation is an intensive and ongoing process that assesses health and social services systems organizations against standards of excellence to identify what is being done well, and where they can improve. This process helps create better services for all, and it allows our organization to better understand how to use resources, increase efficiency, enhance quality and safety and reduce risk. Quote: “I am very pleased with our Health Authorities for receiving and maintaining their accreditation status. This milestone is a testament to the hard work our Health care professionals provide daily, should reassure residents that they are receiving care and services to national standards. -Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick Facts: ·       The NTHSSA received a 97% compliance rate, HRHSSA received 88% compliance rate and TCSA received 98% compliance rate with Accreditation Canada Standards.  ·       The 2019 Accreditation survey is the very first assessment completed of all health and social services in the Northwest Territories.   ·       More than 1,000 health and social service organizations and 7,000 sites in Canada and around the world have been accredited through Accreditation Canada. ·       Accreditation surveys and site visits were completed in late 2019. Surveys and visits review programs and services against national set standards of excellence from Accreditation Canada and the Health Standards Organization. ·       The NTHSSA and the HRHSSA is now accredited until December 2023.

Simpson: Education, Culture and Employment Response to COVID-19","Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 global pandemic has had profound effects on people around the world, including residents across the Northwest Territories (NWT). The Department of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) has been working tirelessly to adapt its programs and services to help lighten the economic, social and emotional weights of the pandemic, and I would like to provide an update to the public about those efforts.  We recognize the essential role that licensed early learning and child care programs have for our youngest residents and their families, and as a result ECE has continued to flow existing funding for licensed programs to daycares and day homes, regardless of whether they have chosen to close or remain open, since the start of the pandemic. In addition ECE helped coordinate with the NWT health authorities to match parents working within the healthcare system with childcare, as well as coordinating an online list of open licenced early learning and child care programs throughout the NWT. To provide further support during this challenging time we responded with an additional $5.1 million in temporary subsidies, including a 33 per cent subsidy for parents who are essential workers, an additional wage top-up of up to $1,000 a month for child care staff or family day home operators providing care during the pandemic.  Mr. Speaker, ECE continues to work closely with licensed early learning and child care programs and pass on regular information updates from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer, including best practices for early learning and child care, to ensure programs that are open remain operational and ones that have closed are able to reopen quickly.  In our Junior Kindergarten-Grade 12 education system, significant efforts have been made by educational staff, students, parents and guardians to accommodate the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. On March 24, 2020 based on my recommendation and initial recommendations from the CPHO, all elected NWT education leaders made the decision to keep schools closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year and to proceed with plans focused on a distance education approach for the continuity of learning for all Junior Kindergarten-Grade 12 students.   On March 30, 2020 we released the NWT Education Bulletin, which set the framework for continued learning. Since releasing the NWT Education Bulletin, ECE has provided additional support to teachers on all aspects of at-home learning, including providing distance supports for students with complex needs, course completion processes for high school students, and at-home Indigenous language learning, among others. ECE is providing guidance and support to Indigenous language instructors during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of our ongoing support for continued learning. Some language instructors have been collaborating with other subject teachers to incorporate language into their units, and many schools are using social media and school websites to promote and teach language and culture during school closures. Mr. Speaker, on May 12, 2020 the Emerging Wisely plan was released, which contained a recommendation for the reopening of schools. On May 13, 2020 NWT education leaders with my support decided that the challenges faced by schools due to the pandemic would make it impossible to reopen schools now and that the focus needed to be on planning for the upcoming 2020-2021 school year. The Department of ECE continues to work closely with education bodies and the NWT Teachers’ Association on continued learning for all NWT students for the 2019-2020 school year and on planning for the fall.  Mr. Speaker, for Grade 12 students who have worked so hard towards graduating and planning their next steps, Career and Education Advisors are reaching out to students by telephone, email and video conferencing to ensure they are aware of the support available to them.  These advisors will continue to offer their support to all interested Grade 12 students from now until September to support those dreams of where their adult lives would take them. I send my congratulations to all NWT high school graduates. You have worked hard and you made it. For post-secondary students accessing Student Financial Assistance, their funding continued for the remainder of their winter semester, and for those repaying loans, we deferred all payments to the end of September 2020, with no interest accrued during this time period. Student Case Officers also reached out to every single student receiving Student Financial Assistance to ensure they had information on how to return home safely, including contacts for travel agencies, information about self-isolation requirements, the self-isolation plan, and the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer. For students who will not have the opportunity to work to repay loans or save, the Student Financial Assistance program provided information on accessing income support and available federal benefits.   Mr. Speaker, to ensure the most vulnerable residents have enhanced supports for themselves and their families, the Income Assistance program made a number of temporary changes beginning in March. We provided a one-time emergency allowance for Income Assistance clients registered in March. Individuals received $500 and families received $1,000 in order to ensure they could purchase the necessary supplies to self-isolate for two weeks, if necessary, and to encourage physical distancing.  Monetary donations such as gifts from friends, family, benevolent organizations or Indigenous governments intended to provide support during the pandemic have been exempted from the calculation of Income Assistance benefits, through the end of June. We also made the decision to exempt the one-time Special GST credit for low and modest income residents, the one-time Special Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement payments for seniors, and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit for students. Administrative processes were streamlined to focus on quick responses and turnarounds for clients, including payrolling all clients through the end of June so that they do not have to report each month. The Productive Choice reporting requirement was also removed, and all clients were directed to engage in only one Productive Choice; taking care of themselves and their families. Finally, all clients were automatically assessed for both basic needs and enhanced benefits. Seniors receiving the Senior Home Heating Subsidy received a modest increase to their benefit beginning in April 2020, and automatically had their applications renewed for the 2020-2021 year to allow them to maintain physical distancing.  Mr. Speaker, Labour Development and Standards programs and services at the Department include Labour Market Programs; Apprenticeship, Trades and Occupation Certification; Employment Standards; and the NWT Nominee Program. These programs provide a range of financial supports to students, apprentices, employees, employers, communities and organizations. Clients have been advised that funding will continue as planned until the end of their programs, tuition refunds would be provided as required, training costs reimbursed, and funding for community and organization training and employment projects would continue.  In the areas of Culture and Heritage, Mr. Speaker, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre and NWT Archives closed to the public on March 16, 2020 due to the serious health concerns posed by COVID-19. Focus was placed on ensuring the public was aware of the museum’s extensive virtual exhibits and online resources. Staff worked hard to ensure delays in funding to NWT artists have been minimal and that accommodations are in place for arts projects impacted by the pandemic, and archaeological permitting and land reviews have continued with minor delays. Phase One of the Emerging Wisely plan recommends museums and art galleries reopen. While reduced hours and reduced public programming are expected the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre is gearing up to open its doors to the public before the end of the month. The Francophone Affairs Secretariat worked quickly to streamline services available to our francophone population. Services TNO positioned itself as a hub for all non-health related information for our French speaking residents, and provided them with a single point of contact for all requests. The Secretariat also provided 24/7 translation services to ensure that our francophone residents had timely access to the vital information being shared by the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer, the Department of Health and Social Services, and every other GNWT department involved in the COVID-19 response.  I want to thank the staff of ECE and the NWT Education Authorities for their incredible work in adapting to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The situation created by the pandemic has been unprecedented and so has the response from our staff. I want to personally thank them for all their efforts and hard work.  Mr. Speaker, everything we have responded with over the last few months has come about through an imperative to support Northerners, to make sure all Northerners had answers to their questions quickly, and critical programs were modified to meet their needs. As we move to adapt our programs further, the residents and communities of the territory are our primary concern and we commit to continuing to provide the supports and services residents need during this difficult time.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The Chief Public Health Officer is leading the public health response and providing subject matter expertise to the Health and Social Services system and Government of the Northwest Territories on pandemic planning requirements.  Our first step in responding to the threat of COVID-19 was to activate the Emergency Operations Center, or EOC, on March 11, 2020. The EOC assesses risks, identifies mitigation measures, and coordinates the Health and Social Services system response and recovery.  It includes representatives from the Department of Health and Social Services, the Health and Social Services Authorities, the Department of Finance and the NWT Emergency Measures Operations, led by the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs.  Mr. Speaker, this early coordination of our health and social services system response allowed for the necessary service adjustments to support the public health orders.  This included reducing non-essential health services in order to ramp up testing, contact tracing, and care for those who may test positive for COVID-19.  We also put in place measures to manage our Personal Protective Equipment inventory for front line health care workers and we are working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada to secure our supply. To safeguard residents living in long-term care facilities, guidelines were implemented to reduce visits, institute daily temperature checks and health screening.  Service providers also implemented protocols in relation to the use Personal Protective Equipment and enhanced disinfection practices well before we had any cases in the NWT. Mr. Speaker, in order to meet the requirements for physical distancing and provide timelier access to care, our health system has expanded virtual care.  This enables practitioners to meet with each other and with a patient over distance.  It also reduces physical patient interactions in waiting rooms, with clinic staff, and with providers through the use of phone visits and 	video-conferencing as well as providing remote access to the Electronic Medical Records.    We have also accelerated Primary Health Care Reform in Yellowknife in order to support the roll out of virtual care and to maintain continuity of services while physician resources are redeployed to other parts of the system. We have now moved to an Integrated Care Team model, which gives clients access to a dedicated primary care team rather than just a doctor.  We are also testing some outreach approaches to provide primary care services to individuals being served by shelter organizations in Yellowknife. Mr. Speaker, at the same time, the three Health and Social Services Authorities have been working diligently to address and prepare for the surge of transmission of the COVID-19 virus.  This coordinated approach across the NWT healthcare system is critical to ensure all resources are aligned in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients, staff and the residents of our territory at various stages of pandemic response.   This four-stage response plan is based on principles that acknowledge that the pandemic response is our government’s primary priority; that all response activities are coordinated and all resources must be managed system-wide.  It also focuses the response within the capabilities of our system:  maximizing and mobilizing staff where needed; moving patients to where care can be provided; redistributing supplies and equipment where and when needed and the appropriate triaging of care, including centralizing hospitalizations in Yellowknife and Edmonton for patients with severe symptoms.   This plan demonstrates a thorough and realistic approach to respond to COVID-19.  The Health and Social Services Pandemic Response Plan is being shared with Members of the Legislative Assembly and will be made public as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, the safety of children and youth in our care has been central to our COVID response.  We are taking every opportunity to improve the quality of our child and family services to positively impact outcomes for children and youth while working within the current public health measures.  During the containment phase of the pandemic, most face-to-face visits were temporarily suspended.  These temporary suspensions were in place to make sure children, families and frontline workers are safe.  Child and family services staff made use of virtual technology to keep children and their families connected with each other and with frontline workers.  With the release of the Emerging Wisely Plan, we are now assessing how to safely, gradually introduce face-to-face visits once again.  We are offering one-time, short-term financial support to help families meet their basic needs if they cannot get enough assistance from other programs and we have extended support services for youth in care and young adults who are aging out of these services during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also working with the Foster Family Coalition of the NWT to respond to the needs of foster caregivers and to provide ongoing support and communication.  We have established respite services for foster caregivers in the NWT to support them during the COVID-19 pandemic and have established clear protocols should a child in their care require testing or care for COVID-19. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our front line health and social services workers for their hard work and dedication to the people they serve.  I recognize that there are many challenges ahead and know that you will continue to serve our residents, as you always have, with professionalism, compassion and commitment. Our health and social services system has responded quickly and effectively to the COVID-19 challenge to date.  I am confident that we are well prepared to respond should there be a surge in COVID-19 transmissions into the future.    However, it remains critically important that we all remain vigilant in following the public health measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 and minimize the demand on our health and social services system.  We are stronger and healthier if we act together.     Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

695,2020-05-29,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-northwest-territories-housing-corporation-capital-delivery-2020-2021,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Northwest Territories Housing Corporation Capital Delivery 2020-2021,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 virus has affected economies all over the world.  On our home ground, it has hit us hard, our communities, our businesses and our people.  We know that the public is ready to get the NWT economy moving again.  There are very few sectors that translate investment so quickly and directly into tangible benefits for our communities than housing.  Housing investment supports local and regional contractors, apprentices, building trades-helpers, homeowners and households needing housing.  The investment isn’t fleeting; it leaves behind critical and important infrastructure that will provide a social benefit year-after-year.   Mr. Speaker, housing is an issue that is best addressed by being person-focused.  Person-focused is how we approach the delivery of our programs, but it is also important in how we deliver infrastructure and capital projects.  Our 2020-2021 housing capital investment plan will bring in much needed employment and apprenticeship opportunities.  For many in our small communities, COVID-19 has left them in either economic hardship or economic uncertainty.  As we try and get back to a semblance of normality, our goal when delivering our housing capital plan is to bring back some financial certainty and opportunities to our residents. Mr. Speaker, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation’s 2020-2021 capital project delivery represents a total investment of over $43.8 million in the NWT.  Approximately 90% of this amount is targeted for housing projects outside of Yellowknife, with the focus being on our smaller communities. It will include the construction of 89 units and repair projects for 160 owned public, market and Homeownership Entry Level Program housing units located throughout the NWT. Highlights of our new construction include:  22 new and replacement units across the NWT including   		 6 market and public housing units in Behchokǫ̀ 2 market housing units in Hay River 4 market housing units in Tulita 6 public housing units in Délı̨nę 2 public housing units in Fort Smith 2 public housing units in Ulukhaktok   9 seniors units in Fort Good Hope,  8 single occupancy public housing units in Yellowknife,  4 New Home Program units in Fort Resolution, Tulı́t'a, Délı̨ne and Tuktoyaktuk,  45 market housing units for RCMP  		6 in Fort Smith 3 in Norman Wells 17 in Inuvik 7 in Fort Simpson, and  12 in Hay River.  This year’s unit repairs also include a major energy project in Yellowknife for the conversion of oil-fired furnaces to biomass heating.  We are undertaking this project with significant assistance from the federal government under the Low Carbon Economy Fund federal program.  The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation will be supplementing this $43.8 million with a further $3.6 million investment to deliver additional unit repairs by utilizing the internally funded $5 million COVID-19 reserve.  The aim of this additional investment is to bring on stream approximately 130 vacant housing units.   Approximately 60 of these units are available for allocation in the short-term.  Many of the remaining units will require some minor or major repair.  When repaired, these units will be allocated for use within the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation 's public housing, market and home ownership programs.   The introduction of these units, as well as the construction of new units, forms the basis of the housing response for any subsequent waves of the COVID-19 virus and is also a step towards fulfilling our mandate commitment to increase the number of affordable homes and reduce core housing need. While we expect that the vast majority of the planned capital investment will be delivered in this fiscal year, some projects such as those involving winter road and barge transportation, may require a two-year delivery.      The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation has a long history of supporting community businesses.  In 2018-2019, 94% of our contracting opportunities were awarded to local and northern businesses, and we expect similar results for this last year.  We have also worked closely with community leadership to obtain support to proceed with the majority of planned delivery for 2020-2021.  Mr. Speaker, housing will be a key element of the economic recovery of this Territory.  The construction, repair and other contract work around housing brings in much needed income to the NWT, and to our smaller communities.  This capital investment will support local and regional contractors, provide opportunities for apprentices and building trades-helpers, and ensures that a large portion of investment stays in the NWT.  I look forward to seeing these new projects and opportunities for our people become reality. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The tourism sector was one of the first hit by the pandemic and will likely be amongst the last to recover from its effects. Northwest Territories tourism is reliant on national and international travel however for the time being our borders must remain closed to protect the health of our residents and our small and remote communities.   We recognize that this is happening at a cost to business owners and entrepreneurs in the Northwest Territories.  For those whose livelihoods are built around attracting and welcoming visitors to our territory, the impacts have been significant.  As we mark National Tourism Week this year, we continue to work with the Government of Canada to identify a measure of relief for the Northwest Territory tourism industry that is reflective of the impact that is being felt and the significance of the tourism sector to our economy.   The advocacy of our territory’s tourism association on behalf of our tourism industry has been instrumental in helping us increase the overall awareness in Ottawa of the need for specific and regionally-appropriate support programs.   The federal government is listening. As a result of our work, CanNor’s Northern Business Relief Fund was introduced and significantly expanded relief options for Northwest Territories and Indigenous businesses. We were also able to secure additional support for the North’s airline industry, which a large portion of our tourism sector relies on.  We know that some of our tourism operators have accessed relief from this fund but we still have work to do. In the coming weeks, Premier Cochrane will be bringing the challenges faced by our tourism sector to the attention of the Prime Minister, asking for more funding under the Northern Business Relief Fund to address the specific needs of our operators and tourism businesses.   Meanwhile, as Northwest Territories businesses begin to resume operations across the territory, and we take steps to recover our economy, we have re-introduced our Support for Entrepreneurs and Economic Development Program, also known as SEED for the 2020-2021 fiscal year.  It represents $4 million dollars of investment into businesses in our communities.   Similarly, we will inject almost $4.4 million into parks infrastructure, tourism product development and community infrastructure projects this summer; supporting local suppliers, contractors and employees as we improve our tourism product for the future.   We will be waiving tourism insurance requirements and licensing fees for the 2020-21 season as another means of short term relief. Mr. Speaker, in the wake of COVID-19 the landscape of tourism in the Northwest Territories has changed.  We are already considering how our next tourism strategy can be adapted and its funding approach redefined to support the economic recovery of our tourism sector. To this end we are once again engaging with our tourism sector specifically to understand the level to which their businesses and operations have been changed.  As we do so, we can take some comfort in what hasn’t, and will not, change.  With its wild natural beauty, rich cultures, midnight sun, and Aurora Borealis, our North remains as attractive as ever before. Northerners will always be warm and welcoming; our industry vibrant and resilient; and our tourism product spectacular. It will take time, and it will take work, but we will recover.   Our borders will open and our North will once again take its place as one of the world’s most spectacular tourism destinations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

700,2020-05-27,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-setting-stage-finalizing-budget-2020,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Setting the Stage for the Finalizing Budget 2020,"When the Legislative Assembly shut down in March due to the COVID Health State of Emergency, the Government of the Northwest Territories was well into its annual budgeting process. As we continue that discussion, we are also moving forward to other financial matters to be discussed during this sitting of the Legislative Assembly.  The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic do not change the Government’s need to continue providing programs and services.   At the same time, we have been responding to the immediate needs of the Northwest Territories economy, communities, businesses and residents as a result of the health restrictions.    Since the 2020-2021 Budget was introduced, the Government’s fiscal situation has worsened as the COVID-19 pandemic has created declines in own source revenues and increases in expenditures as the Government has developed and launched a variety of economic relief packages. The significance of the negative effects on the fiscal framework will be better known as the Emerging Wisely plan is further implemented.   Mr. Speaker, we are fortunate that Canada has provided $23 million in support to the GNWT response that will partially offset costs directly related to COVID-19. Right now, departments are responding to COVID-19 in ways that have not been included in their budgets through existing appropriations. These include the establishment of Emergency Management Operations, which are likely to be ongoing for some time; the roll-out of managed alcohol; check stops at borders; monitoring of incoming air traffic passengers; self-isolation centers in regional centers; and homelessness supports. The Department of Finance is working with all departments and public agencies to track all incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, the Government of the Northwest Territories has spent almost $7.9 million in COVID-related costs and we project an additional $31.1 million will be needed, of which $11.3 million is allocated to the health response.  The Government of the Northwest Territories has also provided targeted assistance to various sectors in the territory including funding for childcare providers, airport landing fee holidays, airport lease fee holidays, and increased income assistance which to date totals over $30 million.   I believe we must work to creatively use further assistance to advance the 19th Legislative Assembly’s Mandate. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting health measures being implemented across the planet have thrown the global economy into the economic equivalent of a 100-year storm.  Given the economic disruption, and despite all immediate government actions to support the economy, things will not be the same when the COVID-19 pandemic health measures have lifted. The Government of the Northwest Territories has a responsibility to support the recovery as quickly as possible or much of the private sector may not have the ability to recover. We need to act quickly and strategically to invest in the future economy and in our residents and businesses in a way that reflects the core values held by Northwest Territories residents and builds on the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly. It is my expectation that through the structure of the Emerge Stronger dialogue and process, we will be able to gather ideas and proposals that reflect needs from across regions, communities and sectors in order to take responsive and responsible funding decisions.  Mr. Speaker, departments have provided high level assessments of COVID-19 impacts on the Mandate priorities and associated actions that indicate a lot of the Mandate items can be fulfilled by the end of the 19th Legislative Assembly with few delays or issues.  As we adjust to a post-COVID environment, I look forward to working with all Members to keep the Mandate largely aligned with the economic and social recovery by recognizing priorities that may no longer be relevant and embracing new priorities that may have emerged.   As part of the 2020-2021 budgeting process, a fiscal strategy has been presented that spans the life of the 19th Legislative Assembly. Part of this strategy identified $25 million to fund Mandate priorities over the next four years.  This funding is proposed to remain in place and the Supplementary Appropriation to be considered this sitting will include an advancement of immediate funding to begin work on several initiatives.   Mr. Speaker, back in February, I indicated that we would hold public discussions on the next budget as soon as possible so that the Assembly would have the benefit of residents’ priorities in advance of finalizing the four-year business plans. These plans and increased program evaluation, among several policy initiatives, are intended to lead to governing so that “the Northwest Territories is a premier destination to live with a positive economic future, strong educational opportunities for our children, quality health care, a respectful approach to honouring lands, water and wildlife, and collaborative relationships with Indigenous governments based in a commitment to reconciliation.” We want to understand how residents interpret what is essentially our mission statement.  The COVID-19 pandemic has not changed this commitment. Over the summer months of 2020, supported by the Department of Finance, I will endeavour to meaningfully engage with residents of the Northwest Territories to determine their views on a variety of topics related to how and why the Government of the Northwest Territories spends money. Of particular interest to me, given the drastic changes that have taken place as a result of COVID-19, is how residents and stakeholders think the Government should change the way we do business and what measured risks they would support the Government to take to aid with the economic and social recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Both extensions will take effect as of May 27, 2020 and expire on June 9, 2020. Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Kami Kandola.  Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. We are now just over a week into eased restrictions as described within Phase One of the Emerging Wisely plan. These include opportunities like increased interpersonal interactions, the opening of some business and organizations, and increased numbers for outdoor gatherings. It is important to remember that most travel into the NWT by non-residents is prohibited with limited exceptions. NWT residents entering the NWT are still required to self-isolate for 14 days in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River or Fort Smith before travelling to their home community.  In order to ensure we can maintain ongoing support of the Public Heath orders, including checkpoints and isolation centres, as well as the ability to respond to any potential new cases and the impacts that might arise, it is necessary to continue to maintain a Public Health Emergency and State of Emergency.  While the Northwest Territories is currently in containment mode, with no evidence of community spread and all cases recovered, the situation can change quickly without carefully managing the continued response.    Nationwide spread is the biggest risk of expanding spread within the Northwest Territories and Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably across Canada.  These extensions reflect the need to remain vigilant and swiftly respond to any changes to the current situation in the Northwest Territories. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continues to enhance our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an ongoing effort to protect the health of the residents of the Northwest Territories. All residents are reminded to follow the orders and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer during this challenging time.

704,2020-05-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-covid-19-public-health-response,Government Website,Diane Thom: COVID-19 Public Health Response,"Check Against Delivery    Mr. Speaker, in the past few months, we have asked people to change the way we live, work and socialize in order to protect our territory against COVID-19.  This is by far.  the most significant public health crisis we have faced in decades.   Today, I would like to reflect on the public health measures we have put in place and how we will continue to protect our territory, while bringing some stability back to our lives.  Mr. Speaker, our response to COVID-19 began well before the Public Health Emergency was called.  In early March, the Department of Health and Social Services and the Chief Public Health Officer activated the Emergency Operations Centre.  This allowed for rapid COVID-19 system planning and preparation.  We had also began enhanced testing of residents and visitors for COVID-19 who presented flu-like symptoms and had travelled outside of the Northwest Territories well before the pandemic was declared.  This allowed us to take quick action if a positive case was confirmed and ensure our testing capability was in place across the NWT. The Chief Public Health Officer also issued guidance to all Long Term Care facilities to protect our elders against the spread of the virus.  Additionally, our health care system initiated enhanced infection control practices in all health care facilities to protect front-line health care workers.   Our public outreach was also increased to provide residents with truthful, evidence-based information on the virus, and how to keep each other safe.  Mr. Speaker, as the situation in Southern Canada began to escalate it was apparent that stronger action was required.  I declared a Public Health Emergency on 	March 18 on the recommendation of the Chief Public Health Officer.  This allowed the Chief Public Health Officer to issue the necessary public health orders to protect our territory.  These Orders prohibited non-resident travel within the territory, mandated two weeks of self-isolation for residents returning from anywhere outside our boundaries, and that Self-Isolation Plans be submitted in order to ensure compliance.  Mr. Speaker, as we began to get positive cases we made the difficult decision to close businesses where physical distancing could not be maintained.  At the same time, we provided the necessary advice for essential businesses and employers to stay open safely.  We also acted to limit the risks from essential workers entering into the NWT to play crucial roles in our society and our economy by getting measures in-place to track them, monitor their health, and have them self-isolate whenever possible.   Mr. Speaker, a significant amount of work went on behind the scenes to build the necessary systems to fully implement the public health measures.  Within hours of restricting travel, our government instituted a public call centre, staffed check stops on our highways and airports, set up self-isolation hubs and implemented a self-isolation planning and assessment process.  The Chief Public Health Officer has also established a Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce trained to respond to public health risks in our communities.  This team is working across the NWT and has visited more than half of our communities to provide outreach events to educate residents about the public health measures as well as enforce.  Mr. Speaker, the results from our initial response has allowed us to contain the spread of COVID-19.  We currently have no active cases and no community spread. That is a testament to the effectiveness of the orders in keeping us safe.  And it is a credit to everyone in this territory who followed the orders and advice to contain this virus.  Mr. Speaker, while implementing timely and aggressive public health measures was necessary to contain the spread, the need to gradually and wisely ease our restrictions was always part of the overall plan.  We were just waiting until it was safe to do so.  Two weeks ago, the Chief Public Health Officer released Emerging Wisely, our path to emerging gradually, safely, and wisely from our strictest public health measures, and bringing some stability back to the territory.  It reflects the caution and care our residents expect in order to continue to protect our remote communities, and our healthcare system.  Through the four phases of easing, restrictions are gradually lifted to allow for residents to visit their friends, family, and neighbours; do more activities; and 	re-open more businesses – and doing it all safely. But we also made it clear that this is not a return to business-as-usual – and it will not be until this pandemic has run its course.  We are calling on residents to accept that some measures will be in place for a long time.  Travel into the territory will remain restricted, and self-isolation requirements will remain in place for residents who chose to travel outside of the NWT and for those entering on an essential or exceptional basis.  And until there is a vaccine, we must keep physical distance of two metres and continue to wash our hands more than we ever have; wear non-medical masks in crowded spaces; and keep our most vulnerable safe.  That is what will keep this territory strong and healthy. Mr. Speaker, all Northwest Territories residents have a role to play.  We must remain mindful and use caution as our restrictions are lifted, because this pandemic will continue – and so will our response.  Lifting restrictions comes with some risks.  It is likely that we will get more cases and we may experience community spread.  And to rise to the challenge, we may need to call on everyone to make sacrifices again.  But with these months behind us, I am confident that Northerners have the strength and resiliency to do what is necessary to protect themselves, their family and friends and communities to remain healthy.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
705,2020-05-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-may-june-2020-sessional-statement,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: May-June 2020 Sessional Statement,"Check Against Delivery    Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome all Members back to the continuation of our Second Sitting of the 19th Legislative Assembly.  Much has changed, in the Northwest Territories and around the world, since our sitting was interrupted by the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic this past March.  Governments across Canada, including our own, have had to take swift and strong action to protect the health and safety of Canadians from this disease.  COVID-19 is a disease that no one in the world has natural immunity to. There is no vaccine, and there is no effective anti-viral treatment for it. The best way to prevent its spread is to ensure people are not exposed to the virus.  Physical distancing was – and still is – the best protection against COVID-19, and that is why governments across Canada moved quickly in mid-March to close businesses, restrict travel and put limits on gatherings of people.  Mr. Speaker, while these strict limits were absolutely necessary for protecting everybody’s health, they were devastating for the national and territorial economy.  The situation has left our government, like all governments in this country, grappling with two challenges at the same time: a public health crisis and a socio- economic crisis.  On the public health side, we have relied heavily on the work of the Northwest Territories’ Chief Public Health Officer, as well as the Department of Health and Social Services and the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority.  Along with public health officials across Canada, the Chief Public Health Officer was monitoring the progression of COVID-19 in other countries and taking steps to make sure the Northwest Territories was ready for it even before the global pandemic was declared on March 11.  The day before the pandemic was declared, the Chief Public Health Officer issued an update on COVID-19, and gave extensive advice to Northwest Territories residents on how to keep themselves safe. Recommendations included avoiding non-essential travel outside of the territory, self-monitoring for people who had recently travelled, reconsidering plans for public gatherings, and keeping a two-week supply of food and medicine at home.  As COVID-19 began to spread in southern Canada, the Minister of Health and Social Services on the recommendation of the Chief Public Health Officer declared a public health emergency in the Northwest Territories on March 18, 2020. The following day, the Government of the Northwest Territories took the unprecedented step of directing its employees to begin working from home, in an effort to help encourage physical distancing and slow the spread of COVID-19. Two days later, on March 21st, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Northwest Territories and a public health order prohibiting travel into the territory was put into place, except for residents returning home and workers providing essential services. All people entering the NWT from outside were also required to self-isolate for 14 days in one of four regional communities where appropriate medical care was available in case they developed COVID-19.  On March 22nd, the Chief Public Health Officer recommended that all mass gatherings be cancelled immediately, and that certain businesses where it would be impossible to maintain physical distancing be closed. These recommendations were made into binding public health orders on April 10, 2020.  To assist with the implementation of the Chief Public Health Officer’s orders, the Government of the Northwest Territories set up regional self-isolation centres for people returning from outside the territory, and established a compliance and enforcement taskforce, drawing on staff from across the Government of the Northwest Territories with enforcement experience.  To better coordinate the whole of government response, the Municipal and Community Affairs Emergency Management Organization was fully activated and a territorial state of emergency was declared on March 24th.  While all these measures were necessary to protect residents and communities from the spread of COVID-19, our government recognizes that these decisions also had serious economic consequences for people, businesses and communities.  We also recognized that we had an obligation to not just protect public health, but to help the territory weather the financial and economic storm that COVID-19 has caused. This would require a whole-of government effort, with all departments involved in the response.  On March 20, just days into the crisis, the Ministers of Finance and of Industry, Tourism and Investment announced on behalf of our government the first set of measures designed to help reduce the impacts of the COVID-19 shutdown on the NWT and its residents.  Valued at $13.2 million dollars, this first economic package included measures like providing low-interest loans through the Business Development and Investment Corporation to help businesses offset the impacts of COVID-19.  The Government of the Northwest Territories also agreed to advance resource revenues to Indigenous governments that are signatories to the devolution agreement and to allow Indigenous governments, non-government organizations and community governments to carry over unused contribution amounts into the current fiscal year.  Increased funding was also made available through Education, Culture and Employment for income assistance clients and seniors to help address the impacts of COVID-19.  In addition to new funding, the Government of the Northwest Territories also decided to suspend or defer the collection of fees and revenues owing to it. This was another way to relieve the financial burden being experienced by people, businesses and communities as a result of COVID-19.  These measures included removing transportation fees by the Department of Infrastructure, deferring Business Development and Investment Corporation and student financial assistance loan payments, pausing most collection efforts, and extending the due date for Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission employer fees. The Northwest Territories Power Corporation contributed to these relief efforts by removing load limiters and ceasing disconnections, as well as pausing its collection efforts.  A second economic relief package valued at almost $8.3 million was announced on March 31st, including additional supports for income assistance clients and further fee reductions.  This package also identified $5 million for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation to create temporary housing for homeless persons, including housing in Yellowknife and 130 units in communities outside the capital.  Further announcements saw Education, Culture and Employment allocate $5 million dollars to support child care for essential workers and decide to exempt federal emergency benefits from income assistance eligibility calculations. The Department of Finance also introduced a wage top-up plan for workers earning less than $18 dollars an hour. The Department of Justice also instituted a moratorium on residential evictions, allowed for rent deferrals for residential tenants affected by the pandemic, while the Housing Corporation enhanced the Territorial Rent Supplement Program.  Leaseholders on public lands are also seeing relief in the form of a $2.7 million dollar decision to waive rent on existing leases for the 2020-2021 fiscal year from the Department of Lands.  Support to businesses has been a joint effort of our government and the Government of Canada, with Government of the Northwest Territories efforts being designed to complement immediate relief available to Northwest Territories businesses from the federal government. In addition to working capital loans provided by the Business Development and Investment Corporation, $4 million dollars is available to territorial businesses through Industry, Tourism and Investment’s SEED Program, to help businesses recover as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.  In the first of two planned announcements, the Government of the Northwest Territories in partnership with the Government of Canada is helping four northern passenger-based airlines access $8.7 million in funding. Further funding announcements with Canada are expected for additional airlines.  Of course, the Northwest Territories is not alone in facing this pandemic, and all Members of Cabinet have been working closely with their federal, provincial and territorial counterparts to help coordinate efforts and advocate for the Northwest Territories.  All Ministers are working hard to ensure that Northwest Territories needs are clearly understood so federal assistance programs benefit our residents and businesses. We are also coordinating on key issues like securing the national supply chain so the territory continues to have access to essential goods, and participating in national bulk orders for personal protective equipment.  While the threat of COVID-19 is not over, our government also recognizes that a complete shutdown of the Northwest Territories economy and society is not sustainable or affordable. Although our priority in the past two months has been on managing the immediate threat to public health, we have also been working on plans for recovery and for emerging wisely.  Mr. Speaker, I am sure all Members felt the same relief I did when the Chief Public Health Officer unveiled her phased plan for carefully relaxing the public health restrictions that have kept Northwest Territories residents safe during the first stages of the pandemic.  To be clear, emerging from those restrictions means taking on greater risk that there could be new COVID-19 infections, but the gradual relaxation outlined in Emerging Wisely will help us manage that risk together.  With a plan in place for managing the public health risk, the Government of the Northwest Territories is now focusing on emerging stronger with a plan for broader social and economic recovery.  This will not be a plan the government develops in isolation; the pandemic hit all sectors of the Northwest Territories and all sectors will need to be involved in designing the recovery. As outlined to Members previously, we will be working closely with Members of the Legislative Assembly to design a plan, advised by committees representing business and industry, Indigenous governments, community governments, and community organizations.  COVID-19 presents a shared challenge like none this government has faced before, Mr. Speaker. No previous territorial government has had to respond to a global health threat so quickly and with so little time to prepare.  I am proud of the work the Government of the Northwest Territories has done to design solutions on the fly, protect public health, manage and mitigate the social and economic impacts on individuals, businesses and communities, and keep essential services running safely.  I want to thank all the staff who worked tirelessly to help support the government’s response to COVID-19, especially our front-line staff in the health care system, staff managing the self-isolation centres and the compliance and enforcement staff protecting our borders and making sure people are following public health orders.  I also want to thank and recognize all the essential workers who have continued to come into work throughout this pandemic – like the truckers, grocery store and pharmacy workers, child care workers law enforcement, and airline employees – who have continued to keep the Northwest Territories moving.  While the entire territory has risen to the challenge of COVID-19, there are more challenges to come. We are a strong and resilient territory, and I am confident that we can successfully manage our way through this pandemic and emerge even stronger, by working together with the same kind of spirit and determination that Northwest Territories residents displayed over the past two months.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

The reintroduction of approximately 130 units will help to reduce overcrowding and assist smaller communities to address homelessness by lowering public housing wait lists. Easing overcrowding will also help us as a territory for any potential second wave of COVID-19.    In terms of sales of NWTHC units for homeownership, priority will be given to applicants who are currently public housing tenants. Doing this will free up public housing units and reduce the number of clients currently sitting on wait lists. As in incentive to attract homeownership clients, a $20,000 improvement allowance will be included.    Quote: “As we work to address housing demand in our small communities, freeing up these approximately 130 units will be very beneficial to supporting residents who are at risk of or currently experiencing homelessness. The allocation of these units will allow us to transition our higher income earners currently in public housing to homeownership, reducing overcrowding, freeing up spaces on the public housing wait lists and providing stable housing for those residents who are at risk.” -Paulie Chinna, Minister Responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation and Minister Responsible for Homelessness     Quick Facts:    Approximately 60 units are available for allocation in the short-term.  Many of the remaining units will require some minor or major repair No new operations and maintenance expenditures will be required for these units. The total number of Public Housing units after the additional units are introduced will still not exceed the budgeted allocation of 2,423 units.   Related links Northwest Territories Housing Corporation – Programs and Services GNWT’s Response to COVID-19   For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

Simpson, the NWT Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) and NWT Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) Dr. Kami Kandola on May 19, 2020 to discuss planning for the coming 2020-2021 school year. Last week, Dr. Kandola released Emerging Wisely, the plan to ease public health restrictions in the NWT during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of Phase 1 of the plan, the CPHO recommended schools could be reopened for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year, provided they are able to follow new health and safety measures.  While education bodies agreed to keep schools closed for the remainder of the year due to operational challenges with reopening, there was strong agreement that the detailed requirements provided by the CPHO provide schools with the necessary guidance to inform ongoing risk assessment and planning for reopening classrooms in the fall, should the COVID-19 situation remain similar. Education leaders and the NWTTA were able to hear from Dr. Kandola on the Emerging Wisely plan and current public health information on COVID-19, and ask questions as it relates to planning for the 2020-21 school year to ensure the safety of staff and students.  The discussion focused on current knowledge about COVID-19 infections among children and youth, balancing the social and health impacts of school closures with safety requirements, and the various public health measures to be put in place at schools, including physical distancing requirements, use of personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning and disinfection, and other types of administrative controls to minimize risk. Questions from education leaders focused on how schools should put health and safety guidance into practice under the new requirements; for example, how to comply with class size limitations in large schools with lots of students, and how to ensure physical distancing in smaller schools with multiple age groups sharing limited space.  Recognizing the varied circumstances of schools across the NWT and their unique challenges, Dr. Kandola emphasized there would not be a one-size-fits-all approach for reopening classrooms. Education bodies will have the flexibility to determine what works best for them based on their capacity, and the Office of the CPHO will be able to provide direction and assistance on risk mitigation as part of their review of each school’s plan for reopening. Education bodies will continue to coordinate with ECE and the NWTTA on planning for the upcoming 2020-21 school year based on the most up-to-date recommendations from the CPHO. The next meeting of NWT Education Leaders and Minister Simpson will take place Wednesday, June 3, 2020. Quotes: “The guidance provided by Dr. Kandola in Emerging Wisely provides important direction for how we can safely reopen schools in the fall. I’m grateful for her expertise and openness in working with our Education Leaders to convey the latest public health information and recommendations, and to assist as we balance the need to support our students with the need to protect all residents of the NWT.” 	-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment ""The Education Leaders thank Dr. Kandola for providing more clarity around the Emerging Wisely document and its implications for the health and safety of students, staff, parents and visitors. It was acknowledged that we have very different circumstances, be they in the regional centres or in our remote communities, and that each school and district will have to plan for the reentry of students in the way that best aligns to their reality. We also know that we have the support of ECE, the NWTTA and the CPHO moving forward. This support will be crucial in the weeks and months to come. We remain optimistic and we will continue to inform our stakeholders as plans are developed."" 	 -Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

As part of the GNWT’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and recognizing that acquiring personal protective equipment (PPE) would be challenging for governments and organizations in the NWT due to increased global demand, the GNWT is working to procure PPE and distribute bulk orders throughout the territory. The orders in question were part of this effort to support communities, Indigenous governments and non-government organizations.  The recalled KN95 masks in the orders are made by several overseas manufacturers. They have been recalled by Health Canada because they do not meet the 95 per cent filtration specifications for medical respirators in Canada. The recall was issued on May 11, 2020. Procuring PPE at this time has proven very challenging for the GNWT, as this equipment is in great demand across the country and globally. The KN95 masks were ordered before the Health Canada recall was issued. The GNWT is contacting the community governments and organizations who received these shipments of KN95 masks and informing them they cannot be used for medical or industrial purposes.  The health and safety of NWT residents is the main priority of the GNWT. That is why it has invested resources into procuring and distributing PPE throughout the territory during these challenging times. It will take steps to address the situation and make any necessary adjustments to ensure it is sourcing PPE that meet Health Canada standards in the future.    Quote “The GNWT takes this matter very seriously and we are doing all we can to inform communities and organizations about the KN95 mask recall and to ensure we have the processes in place to prevent a similar situation from happening again.  We are already actively working to replenish this order as we assist communities and residents to find the PPE supplies that will protect them from the COVID-19 virus and keep them safe.” -Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories     Quick Facts ·       PPE is a vital control measure that, used appropriately with other controls, can prevent transmission of infectious disease and save lives.  ·       PPE includes face masks, eye protection, gowns, and gloves. KN95 masks are designed to filter out at least 95 per cent of airborne particles and are most necessary in health care settings and may also be used in some industrial applications. ·       PPE is not a substitute for physical distancing or engineered and administrative controls intended to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.    Media contact  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories PressSecretary@gov.nt.ca "

719,2020-05-15,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/phase-one-eased-public-health-measures-begins,Government Website,Phase One of Eased Public Health Measures Begins,"Today, the Northwest Territories (NWT) takes its first careful steps towards a more open society.  As announced on May 12th, the territory needed to complete several essential steps to move into relaxing phase one of eased measures outlined in the Emerging Wisely Plan shared with residents by the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) earlier this week.  Today, the territory completed the final essential step by having no community spread for 28 days since the last negative test was collected for the final recovered case. With no community spread, the territory is now implementing an order to ease up on the public health restrictions across the NWT. The order is effective immediately.  NWT residents can expect to enjoy more interpersonal contact, outdoor gatherings of up to 25 people, as long as physical distance is maintained, and some businesses and organizations can open with new rules. Other phase one activities include outdoor sports clubs and organizations opening with restrictions, and some recreation facilities – including outdoor kitchen shelters and day-use areas in parks opening.  Orders on travel restrictions, essential workers, remote camp-workers, physical distancing of two metres, and the requirement not to participate in activities if you are sick will remain in-place for the foreseeable future.     Quotes:  “The health and safety of NWT residents is our main priority as the Government of the Northwest Territories. We aren’t out of the woods yet, and as we head into the long weekend, I urge all residents to remember  that we need to work together to keep COVID-19 out of the NWT.  Pleases follow the measures in place and abide by the Chief Public Health Officer’s recommendations as we enjoy this first long weekend with a more open society.” -Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories   “Implementing phase one of our Emerging Wisely plan is exciting news and I hope residents across the territory enjoy time with friends and family this weekend that you maybe haven’t been able to see in some time. That being said, I want to remind folks that our Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce will continue to investigate and respond to reports throughout the weekend to ensure compliance with these new orders are maintained. Now, more than ever, we need to work together to keep each other safe.”  -Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services Quick facts:  Here’s how indoor visitation works:   		Each household can have up to five people they don’t live with come over and be inside their house, to a maximum of 10 people in total inside the house at any time. This is required.  				It's strongly recommended that in your household, you keep a circle of friends as small as possible. Here are a few good ways to do it. Keep to your fave five: Stick with the same five people to invite over to your place. Remember – you could still hang out with others at a park or in your backyard as long as you keep two metres apart. Your fave five would just be for inside your house where the risk is highest.  Have each person in the house pick one person they will have over regularly: this is a great way to make sure your best friends can come over for a coffee, while your household’s circle stays small. Pick another house with your best friends or a family you get along with and have them over regularly: this is another way to keep your circle small.   It’s also strongly recommended that you keep physical distance of two metres in your house as much as you can to protect each other.  If you’re having someone over who’s older, has a weaker immune system, or has an illness already, we strongly recommend your house doesn’t have anyone else over while they are.  Our message to NWT resident: use your common sense to protect each other while we all get some relief from being cooped up.  Certain other indoor gatherings will be allowed to a limit of 10 persons or less – with strict physical distancing measures in-place. Outdoor gatherings will be limited to 25 persons or less – with strict physical distancing measures in-place.  Some organizations will be able to open up – including personal service establishments, massage therapy clinics, chiropractors, museums and art galleries, and others, so long as they put in place the required public health mitigation measures. Outdoor sports, with the exception of rugby, will be able to occur as long as the outdoor gathering limit is maintained Outdoor kitchen shelters and day use areas at parks can be opened. Overnight camping is not permitted at private or publicly-owned campgrounds until phase two. Specific types of mass gatherings will be allowed with capacity and other restrictions in place. For example: farmer’s markets, some recreational facilities, libraries, golf courses, beaches, boat launches, and playgrounds.

Simpson and the NWT Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) on May 13, 2020 to discuss the recent recommendation that NWT schools are safe to reopen for the remainder of the school year as part of Phase 1 of Emerging Wisely: Path to Eased Public Health Restrictions. All leaders agree that the recommendation from the NWT Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) that schools can be reopened is encouraging news as it relates to the COVID-19 situation, and that the detailed risk assessment planning process provided by the CPHO gives schools the essential guidance needed to move forward with reopening classrooms for students and staff. As circumstances vary greatly across communities and regions in terms of capacity to reopen schools at this time, Education Leaders have agreed to take a coordinated, territory-wide approach to determining if schools will reopen for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. Due to the many complex operational challenges faced by schools at this time, Education Leaders have decided not to reopen schools for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. These challenges include, but are not limited to, the absence of teachers in many communities, strong concerns from local governments, and an immediate shortage of the equipment required to maintain safety under the CPHO’s recommendations. Most schools anticipate being unable to complete and implement the rigorous risk management plans needed to reopen prior to the end of the school year. With the ECE Minister’s support, Education Leaders have agreed to use the new recommendations of the CPHO to inform ongoing planning for the 2020-21 school year to ensure strong health and safety practices are put in place for staff, students and their families. Both the Minister and Education Leaders recognize the efforts that educational staff, students, parents and guardians have made to accommodate the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation over the past weeks. Many difficult decisions have had to be made in the interest of public safety in a short amount of time, and the education system will continue to adapt to public health information as it becomes available, while taking into consideration the unique circumstances of schools and communities across the territory. ECE continues to provide guidance and resources to schools to help them support students and families with at-home learning for the remainder of the year, and ECE, Education Bodies and the NWTTA will continue to work together on planning for the coming 2020-21 school year based on the most up-to-date recommendations from the CPHO.   Quotes: “I am encouraged by the recent recommendations of the NWT Chief Public Health Officer regarding the safe operation of schools during the time of COVID-19. I understand the many challenges faced by our Education Bodies across the territory, and support their unified decision to focus efforts on planning for the fall while supporting continued learning for all NWT students for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.” 					- R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “The phased-in approach to lifting restrictions as described in Emerging Wisely is indeed welcome news. As school boards, we have heard the recommendation that schools can reopen. Together, we have analyzed our capacity to do so and have determined that for the safety of our staff and students, we will not.

Both extensions will take effect as of May 13, 2020 and expire on May 26, 2020. These extensions are due to the continued need for response to the COVID-19 global pandemic to protect public health in the Northwest Territories and do not indicate a significant change in circumstances or an increased risk to the people of the NWT. Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Kami Kandola.  Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. This extension of the Public Health Emergency allows the Chief Public Health Officer to continue to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic. Extending the State of Emergency ensures the Emergency Management Organization (EMO) continues to be in a position to support the orders issued by the Chief Public Health Officer. While the Northwest Territories is currently in containment mode, with no evidence of community spread and all cases recovered, we continue to see new cases in the rest of Canada.  With community spread continuing at high levels across Canada, the risk presented remains high to the Northwest Territories. The NWT relies in part on out-of-territory workers to maintain essential services and deliver on critical projects.  The need to maintain border controls to limit the exposure to COVID-19 continues to be a priority. Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably across Canada.  With the current Public Health Emergency in place, the Chief Public Health Officer has been able to safeguard our territory and to develop forward looking plans that are only possible with the Public Health Emergency and the State of Emergency in place.  These extensions reflect the need to remain vigilant and swiftly respond to any changes to the current situation in the Northwest Territories. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continues to enhance our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an ongoing effort to protect the health of the residents of the Northwest Territories. All residents are reminded to follow the orders and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer during this challenging time.   For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

Under this program, businesses are asked to apply for temporary funding to increase the wages of their employees who make less than $18 per hour, for a maximum of 16 weeks between April 1 and July 31, 2020. The program is available to all workers in the NWT that are currently earning less than $18 per hour and are over 15 years old. The federal government has contributed $4.74 million for the NWT Wage Top-up Program, which is intended to assist all lower-wage workers working to keep the economy running while physical distancing measures are in place. Businesses can start applying immediately for funding to top up employees’ wages from April to $18/hour. While the intent of the program is to help employees, we are asking businesses to partner with us to deliver the program, as the funding will flow through the employer. With that in mind, employees are encouraged to make sure that their employer is aware of the program and notify them if not. Quotes: “The NWT Wage Top-up Program provides a thank you in the form of a financial boost to our lower paid workers who are continuing to help sustain the NWT economy while the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic continues. I call on all NWT businesses with employees to participate, and thank them in advance for helping to make this program successful.  All residents and families are struggling in some way during this pandemic. My hope is that these measures will offer some relief, and a well-deserved ‘thank-you’, to those among us who need and deserve it most.   We will continue to monitor the economic impact of COVID-19 and introduce further supports for NWT residents and businesses to help support and re-build the NWT economy.” -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance   ” There are many lower-wage workers who must still work outside the home during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide essential services that our residents and communities rely on. The NWT Wage-top up program is a way to give back to those workers who have continued to provide essential services to our residents. I want to thank each of you for helping us get through these unprecedented and challenging times.” 					-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment  Quick facts: ·       The wage top-up is a taxable benefit for employees. ·       Businesses will receive a one-time payment from the GNWT to cover the administrative costs of adjusting their employees’ wages and the employer CPP and EI contributions for the top-up portion of the employee’s wages. ·       Businesses will be asked to complete an application, providing eligible employee hours and wages. Once applications are approved, the GNWT will issue monthly payments to employers to cover the cost of the top-up, for a maximum of 16 weeks.

The plan, titled Emerging Wisely, outlines where we are today, how we got here, and a five-part approach for gradually moving the territory from the containment measures in-place today through four phases of eased measures. The path includes progressively-eased restrictions on people, businesses, and activities important to residents.  Beginning as soon as circumstances allow and rolling out over the next 12-18 months, the phases are as follows:  ·       Current state: Containment  ·       Relaxing Phase 1: First steps  ·       Relaxing Phase 2: Next steps  ·       Relaxing Phase 3: Careful steps past the second wave ·       Final Measures Lifted Included are descriptions of what requirements must be met to begin moving into each phase, what kinds of activities will be considered within each phase, and timeframes in which they can be expected (where they can be predicted).  Notably, the plan introduces a new model for indoor visitation – the Friendship Circle – whose implementation will begin in phase one.  The plan also highlights the measures which will need to be in place until a vaccine or effective treatment is widely available to NWT residents. There are also scenarios described which could cause the territory to move back to stricter measures. While everything will be done to avoid returning to aggressive containment measures, three criteria for considering a return to containment measures are also identified:  ·       Travel prohibition and restriction failures ·       Loss of contact tracing abilities  ·       Health system breakdown   Quotes  “Responding to the threat of COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories required strong measures and swift action. Because of the actions we took, the NWT is now in a position to start gradually relaxing the restrictions on our people and communities, including allowing bigger indoor and outdoor gatherings, and allowing some businesses to re-open. The measured approach outlined by Dr. Kandola will help us get the NWT and its economy moving again, while continuing to protect the health of NWT residents.” -Caroline Cochrane, Premier   “Residents and businesses have made huge sacrifices to protect each other in this unprecedented time. And together, we did something amazing: we all got on the same team to change our lifestyles, and we contained this virus for now. And that means that together, we can now start gradually, and safely re-introducing the things we love most into our daily routines. So, as we move forward, focus on your wellbeing because we’re in this fight for the long-haul – and we need to be in it together.”  -Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services    Quick facts  ·       Some measures are going to have to stay in place until the pandemic is over, including:  o   Travel restrictions at the border;  o   Self-isolation for returning travelers; and  o   Robust testing.  ·       There may be a need to re-impose restrictions when COVID-19 risk levels increase. These restrictions may not need to be the same for all communities and regions. Where community spread remains limited, regional or community-specific restrictions will be considered so areas considered to be at lower-risk may maintain their freedoms while outbreaks are controlled.  ·       Here’s how indoor visitation will work, beginning in phase one:  o   Each household can have up to five people they don’t live with come over and be inside their house. A maximum of 10 people in total can be inside the house at any time. This is required.  o   It's strongly recommended that in your household, you keep a circle of friends as small as possible. It’s also strongly recommended that you keep physical distance of two metres in your house as much as you can to protect each other.  o   If you’re having someone over who’s older, has a weaker immune system, or has an illness already, we strongly recommend your house doesn’t have anyone else over while they are.  o   Our message to NWT resident: use your common sense to protect each other while we all get some relief from being cooped up. ·       The phases and eased measures identified in the plan were developed through an exhaustive risk assessment completed by the Department of Health and Social Services – based on balancing personal freedoms with the need to manage the public health crisis through 2-3 waves throughout Canada and the United States.  ·       The public health risk assessment in the appendix provides useful information for organizations to understand what steps they must take to get ready to re-open.  ·       The Worker’s Safety and Compensation Commission has guidance and advice to be provided to those looking for information on how to implement these requirements in their workplaces. They are available to answer questions about workplaces.  ·       Additional questions on complying with the requirements of these phases should be sent to protectnwt@gov.nt.ca.    Relevant links ·       Emerging Wisely: Continued Public Health Response to COVID-19 in the NWT ·       Worker’s Safety and Compensation Commission COVID-19 information for employers – including workplace risk assessments     For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications Government of the Northwest Territories  Presssecretary@gov.nt.ca  "

The Department of ITI has developed a program guideline for 2020-21 focused on keeping investment within our communities and supporting local employment. It will work to prioritize applications from NWT businesses whose proposals focus on economic recovery.  The SEED program will be used to help businesses recover as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and encourage new, innovative proposals that reflect the realities of the new post-COVID-19 economy. A key milestone in the re-opening of SEED applications was the establishment of CanNor’s Northern Business Relief Fund on April 20, 2020.

This morning I am here to talk a bit about some changes coming out of the Department of Lands, in response to the impacts of COVID-19.  The physical distancing and isolation measures used to combat the spread of COVID-19 have created new and very real economic stress on Northwest Territories residents, families, businesses, Indigenous governments and communities.  The Government of the Northwest Territories understands these financial stresses and continues to make changes to our programs, services, and policies.  That’s why the Department of Lands is going to ease some of the burden, by waiving rent on existing surface leases on public land, for the fiscal year 2020-21.  The fair and equitable treatment of all leaseholders is important.  Big or small, they are all impacted by the current crisis.  The COVID-19 pandemic affects all NWT residents and businesses and the rent relief will help limit expenses, and keep cash available for immediate needs in this time of uncertainty. The rent relief is available to all holders of existing recreational, residential, and commercial and mining surface leases.  The rent relief will also apply to easements or licences of occupation and will be applied retroactively to April 1, 2020 until March 31, 2021.  This will allow all leaseholders to receive the same rent relief as those who received it at the beginning of the pandemic, but will not apply to new applications received after April 1, 2020.   If you’re a lease holder and your rent has already been paid for the 2020/21 fiscal year, and your account is in good standing, your payment will be automatically refunded.  These are challenging times for many, and the Government of the Northwest Territories will continue to do what we can do ease the financial burden our residents are faced with and make sure our residents feel safe.

Collectively, our territory – its governments, business chambers, and stakeholder organizations – have been able to create an important awareness in Ottawa about the need for specific and regionally-appropriate support programs for Northwest Territories businesses.   It’s a message that I have personally been loud and persistent in delivering, and it’s a message that seems to be getting through.  CanNor’s Northern Business Relief Fund has significantly expanded relief options for Northwest Territories and Indigenous businesses; and we were able to secure additional support for the North’s airline industry. I want to thank you all for your role in this success.   We know we still have work to do, and we will continue to advocate for more supports. This includes our home-based businesses as well as additional supports for our tourism sector. This work is ongoing. The Premier laid out some of the principles behind our social and economic recovery plan last week in a presentation to our colleagues in the Legislative Assembly.  I want to especially thank Jenni (Bruce) for agreeing to co-chair the new Business Advisory Council that will help lead the way forward.   I can tell you that we are planning for a slow and steady - but long - period of recovery.  Our economy will continue to be reliant on our resource sector and on our diamond mines.  We are working to ensure that our mines can operate through this crisis because we will need them to anchor our recovery. Mining and exploration is the biggest source of private sector jobs and income for our residents and a major buyer of products and services from our businesses.  The Chief Public Health Officer has said that for the foreseeable future our borders will remain closed to non-essential traffic.   When it happens, economic recovery will need to begin within our territory; and it will depend greatly on what we can do together and for each other.  We have just this week re-opened our SEED program.  It represents $4 million dollars of potential investment into our communities.  Our intent is to prioritize proposals that are forward-looking, where community employment is emphasized, and the bulk of the funds will be spent locally. Obviously, we will continue, as you have, to lobby the federal government to work with us and the Northwest Territories business community to help businesses recover and adapt to the changing business environment.   We will also be asking Northwest Territories residents to play a role.    The importance of the “Buy North”, or “Spend NWT”, message has never been as true as it is today.   And, I can tell you, it is a message that will extend to residents and governments equally.  Within the Departments of ITI and Infrastructure we are already considering changes to our procurement policies and practices to expand our support of Northwest Territories business coming out of this crisis.   We took our first step in that direction last week with our decision to support Northwest Territories manufacturers in a way that will allow them to meet our territory’s demand for Personal Protective Equipment.  As work continues on the plan to re-open the Northwest Territories’ economy, businesses need to do their part to prepare so they can be ready to open up when the time is right. Physical distancing measures are likely to be in place for a long-time.  Additional PPE will be required for many businesses as they prepare to re-open.  If you are looking for a take-away message from me this afternoon - it is that we are changing our thinking – and ever-so-cautiously beginning to look ahead.   But we are only able to do so because of the work that we have already done across our government: By providing those early loans to ensure liquidity while we sorted out next steps;   By finding ways for the mines to operate through the pandemic; By implementing a pause for  the resource exploration sector while we secure a longer term solution;   By securing the supply chain; By eliminating fees and speeding up payments to NWT companies;  But most importantly, by working and lobbying Canada and its Northern Economic Development Agency to provide relief where and when it was needed most.   Given the scarcity of our financial resources, it was important to us that GNWT programs compliment federal programs as opposed to duplicating them.   Our approach means that we can now commit our full financial capacity to the purposes of economic recovery. If there is a silver lining, I believe the collective world-wide effort that will be put into economic recovery will bring new opportunities.  If we can position ourselves to learn from the wave of innovation that I believe we will see, perhaps we can re-imagine our own economy for the future; one that continues to promote our wealth of natural resources but also encourages a more diversified and resilient economy that builds upon our natural strengths. I promise that we will throw everything we have as a government into identifying and implementing a recovery effort that will enable us to emerge from this crisis with a brighter future.  If there is ever a place where the people are adaptable and creative it’s the north. And it is that adaptability and creativity that will allow us to emerge from this pandemic stronger than ever. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today and I hope to have many similar opportunities again in the future.  Have a great afternoon. "

I want to begin by saying that our thoughts are with the people of Hay River who are facing flood risks alongside a pandemic.  We appreciate the work everyone is doing on the frontlines to keep people safe from the flood, and making sure good public health practices are followed as much as possible as the response unfolds.  And I urge everyone to be kind to each other. Everyone is under a lot of stress. Making sure we’re all helping out and taking care of each other can go a long way in helping us stay strong emotionally and mentally as emergency response continues.  We are through yet another week and all indications say we have remained successful in containing the spread of COVID-19 in our territory.  I am pleased to say that we have also seen a rise in testing since expanding our clinical criteria – which is exactly what we wanted.  We saw 147 tests collected between April 27 and May 1st – the first full work week since announcing our expanded criteria. Compare that to 87 collected from April 20 - April 24. That’s a 59% increase – and we hope that trend continues as we move forward.  I am pleased to say that we’re on the homestretch in developing our plan to emerge from our current levels of restrictions.  These next days will be about preparing for these next steps.  We are finalizing the public presentation of the plan so residents see a clear path forward for gradually, safely emerging from these public health measures – and how it will affect their lives. And we are working with our partners to develop guidance for businesses and organizations so they can understand and implement the requirements they will need to meet to take advantage of eased measures in the near future.   I am excited to share these details with you as soon as I can.  And as I do each week, I want to thank NWT residents for the extraordinary commitment they’ve demonstrated to fighting back against COVID-19. As of today, we’ve contained this together.  And together, we will continue to rise to the challenge.  Thank you. "

Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) met with territorial education leaders and the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) during their biweekly teleconference on May 5, 2020 to further discuss continued learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on what is currently being done to support families and students with complex needs. Leaders shared the work underway by educational staff in each region to help families support at-home learning and mental well-being for students with complex needs during this unprecedented time of school closures, and the areas where more support is needed. Education bodies have reported needing further assistance with planning for students with complex needs, meeting respite requests from families and emerging counselling needs, and centralizing resources for educators that focus on complex needs. ECE continues to work collaboratively with education bodies on continuity of learning for all students, including those with Student Support Plans and Individual Education Plans. Education staff are taking into consideration the needs of all students in preparing lessons, materials and resources for distance learning. Program Support Teachers work collaboratively with education staff to help design and plan for students by providing resources like learning kits and visual aids, connecting families virtually with consultants, and doing check-ins to ensure families feel supported and can reach out for more help if needed. Support Assistants that have not been redeployed have been reaching out to connect with students and families and provide virtual support where possible. Assistive technology is also being made available to households as needed. A variety of resources for teachers and parents have been developed by educators across the territory, and education bodies are working together to create a centralized resource database to make activities and resources that support at-home learning for students with complex needs available to Regional Inclusive Schooling Coordinators across the NWT. ECE is also ensuring the continued availability of remote counselling services for students during COVID-19. A total of 34 mental health counsellors continue to provide services to 47 schools in the territory, and all education bodies have been provided with a master list of counsellors in the NWT in order to ensure services can be accessed quickly by JK-Grade 12 students when necessary. Work is underway to ensure students in need have the technology to access counselling, safely and privately. The Department is also exploring ways to provide families with access to respite services during the COVID-19 pandemic. With ECE support and health guidance from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer, education bodies across the NWT are maintaining food programs for families in need by supplying prepared packages of food, partnering with community agencies, sharing food funding or staff, providing grocery vouchers or accounts, and delivering takeout meals, depending on the unique needs and circumstances of the community. This flexible approach is proving successful, and education bodies are looking at ways to sustain healthy foods programming through the summer.  As well, an increasing number of requests for Jordan’s Principle and Child First Initiative funding continue to be made by individuals in the NWT and by NWT schools, for both this school year and next.  The next meeting of education leaders with Minister Simpson is scheduled for Tuesday, May 19, 2020. Quotes “Schools provide so much more than learning for students and families in the NWT; they provide vital supports and offer a safe and caring environment for many of our youth. This is especially true for students who require additional help, whether through counselling, learning aids, assistive technology or healthy snacks. For students with complex needs, the effects of school closures due to COVID-19 are particularly challenging. ECE is working hard to support education staff and families to access the resources they need for at-home learning and mental well-being during this difficult time, and ensure our most vulnerable students continue to receive the critical supports they depend on.” -R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “For the bulk of our students, learning is moving forward positively. Teachers and program support teachers have also reached out to parents of students with learning difficulties to assist them in understanding what the schools have in place for their child, and how to translate that information into meaningful support for parents teaching their child at home. Assistive technology, software and material resources have been distributed to families. For all education bodies, the well-being of all of their students and parents is extremely important. Our goal is to be as responsive to all needs as we can in this new delivery model.” -Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders Related Links Education Bulletin - March 31, 2020 Resources for parents to support learning at home Resources for parents and students - Mental health and wellness Supporting your child with complex needs: Learning at home during school closures Media contact: Cabinet Communications  PressSecretary@gov.nt.ca"

Simpson announced the exemption of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) for Income Assistance (IA) clients. These benefits would normally be counted as unearned income and would affect a client’s IA benefit amount. The IA program provides financial assistance to residents, aged 19 years or older, to assist with their basic and enhanced needs.  These needs include the actual costs associated with shelter and utilities, as well as set amounts for food, clothing and additional allowances for Seniors and Persons with Disabilities.  Food and clothing amounts are based on family size and the location of community. The CERB payment, which is available to Canadians who have earned a minimum of $5,000 through employment over the last 12 months and who have lost income due to COVID-19,  provides $2,000 per month up to four months to eligible residents. The CESB payment provides $1,250 per month to eligible postsecondary students who are not eligible for the CERB. Eligible students include those in existing programs, recent graduates, and those registered for a postsecondary program in fall 2020.  For disabled students or students with dependents, the CESB provides $2,000 per month. These benefits are available from May through August 2020.  This latest announcement is in addition to the changes made to the program in March to support the Northwest Territories’ most vulnerable residents.    Quote: “While we have continued to support the most vulnerable residents in the territory with flexible changes and advice during these difficult times, we have further opportunities to leverage the federal government benefits, as a number of other jurisdictions across the country have done. With many people out of work and students that have few prospects for summer employment, there are unique challenges facing families and individuals. Any assistance we can provide to help reduce some of the stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is an action we will swiftly take.”   - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “I thank Minister Simpson and his government for their leadership in deciding to exempt Canada Emergency Response Benefit payments for income assistance clients. This will ensure that some of our most vulnerable Canadians, including persons with disabilities, receive the supports they need during this pandemic. The response to this pandemic has been a Team Canada effort, and today’s announcement illustrates how collaboration helps protect the well-being and safety of Canadians.” 					- Hon. Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, Government of Canada    Quick Facts: On March 23, all GNWT buildings were closed, and essential employees continued to work with clients and the public by phone and email.  All Client Services Officers continue to serve Income Assistance clients, seniors, persons with disabilities, and students. Exempting the federal benefits is an addition to the number of flexible changes made through Income Security Programs to support NWT residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Income Assistance Clients applying for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit are encouraged to review eligibility requirements here.  The Canada Emergency Student Benefit is available to postsecondary students from May through August 2020. Both the CERB and the CESB are taxable benefits.

Yellowknife Women’s Centre Transitional Housing Starting today, as part of the COVID-19 homelessness response plan, the suites located in the former Arnica Inn building will start accepting individuals using local shelters who would be at very high risk of serious illness if they were to contract COVID-19. This includes people over the age of 60, those with underlying health conditions like asthma or diabetes, or other vulnerabilities.  This new option was made possible through a partnership between the Yellowknife Women’s Society and the Government of the Northwest Territories. At this time 25 rooms are available, which is sufficient to meet the need.  There is remaining capacity for additional clients if demand increases.  Day and Sobering Centre Also starting today the Yellowknife Day and Sobering Centre, operated by the NWT Disabilities Council, will re-establish operations as a drop-in day centre and sobering centre offering services 7 days a week. Services will be adjusted with reduced capacity to accommodate physical distancing.  The expanded day program at the Salvation Army will continue to operate to ensure adequate capacity for day shelter services in Yellowknife.

They are in Inuvik, Hay River and Yellowknife. At least twelve depot operators are eligible for continued grants under the COVID-19 Recycling Operator Support Program. This program was created to help ensure the long-term viability of licensed beverage container depots and processing centres in the Northwest Territories (NWT) and is intended to sustain depots that regularly operated depots in the 2019/20 fiscal year. Depot grants are calculated based on the NWT Food Price Index, the size of the community served by the depot, and whether the depot is a school or a registered non-profit organization. Monthly reporting is not required to trigger grant payments during the state of emergency. Bottle deposits and fees are a critical part of the Beverage Container Program and will remain in place. Residents are encouraged to hold on to their bottles until depots are able to re-open. More than 28 million beverage containers were distributed and more than 24 million were returned in the last fiscal year. The total number of containers returned over the life of the program is more than 336 million.   For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

This week, we’ve been focused on planning for emerging gradually, and safely, from our current levels of public health restrictions.  The changes we’ve introduced to our Public Health Orders this week are allowing us to consider taking these first steps.  Because if we can track those entering our territory when they’re at highest-risk of transmission, and keep our boundaries strong, we can bring more freedom and stability to our residents as we continue our response to this virus.  My team and I are working around-the-clock – analyzing all the data we have on transmission dynamics, cases, deaths, and the situation across Canada and the globe – and deliberating on the best way to move forward with our territory’s unique needs in mind.  But I’ll echo my statement from last week, and impress just how important it is we get this plan right from the start – and that we communicate this shift to all residents correctly.  With that in-mind, we will be continuing our work this week to get this right from the start, and we look forward to sharing details of how we plan to do that as soon as possible.  What I can share right now is some of the things we’ll be considering:  The right way to ease restrictions on gatherings;  How to safely provide businesses with relief; The best ways to manage returns to work within government and schools;  How to continue to protect against further introduction of COVID-19 within our territory; and  How to keep our most vulnerable safe until we get a vaccine.  We will not have further details today because it is important we present a plan with the triggers, milestones, and parameters defined right away so we do not confuse residents.  Lastly, as I do every week, I want to offer my deepest gratitude to NWT residents and organizations who have taken this seriously, and made extraordinary sacrifices from the start.  It is your efforts to follow our orders, and change your lifestyles, that has kept your communities, and our loved ones, safe.  Together, we have planked the curve – something very few have achieved thus far.  And if we do this right, and we are all really careful, we’re in a position to keep it going through the second and third waves we are expecting to see across the rest of Canada.  So be proud of yourselves – because even though it might not feel like it sometimes, you are all doing something amazing right now.  Thank you.                           "

Both extensions will take effect as of April 29, 2020 and expire on May 12, 2020. These extensions are due to the continued need for response to the COVID-19 global pandemic to protect public health in the Northwest Territories and do not indicate a significant change in circumstances or an increased risk to the people of the NWT. Minister of Health and Social Services Diane Thom extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Kami Kandola.  Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. A Public Health Emergency allows the Chief Public Health Officer to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic. Extending the State of Emergency ensures the Emergency Management Organization (EMO) continues to be in a position to support the orders issued by the Chief Public Health Officer. While the Northwest Territories is currently in containment mode, with no evidence of community spread and all cases recovered, the situation can change quickly without carefully managing the continued response.    Nationwide spread is the biggest risk of expanding spread within the Northwest Territories and Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably across Canada.  These extensions reflect the need to remain vigilant and swiftly respond to any changes to the current situation in the Northwest Territories. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continues to enhance our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an ongoing effort to protect the health of the residents of the Northwest Territories. All residents are reminded to follow the orders and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer during this challenging time.   For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

For example, a family of two adults and two children will receive $224.00. For a child in shared custody each parent will receive one-half of the benefit for the child.   The NWT Cost of Living Offset (COLO) is a benefit paid to individuals and families living in the NWT to help offset the cost of the NWT carbon tax. The benefit is tax-free to NWT residents and families.   To be eligible for the  April 30th COLO payment, one must be an NWT resident for at least three months before the payment date and have filed an income tax and benefit return for the 2018 year.   Starting in July 2020, annual  COLO amounts will increase to $156  for an individual and $180 per child and payments will be issued quarterly. Single individuals in the NWT will receive their full annual payment in July because their quarterly payments would be less than $50.    NWT residents will automatically receive the July 2020 quarterly payment if they have filed their 2019 tax return before June 1st, 2020.   The Canada Revenue Agency issues all COLO payments on behalf of the Government of the NWT. Payments will be issued by cheque or direct deposit based on the information and preferences  recipients have on file with the Canada Revenue Agency. There is only one payment issued per household.    NWT residents who are eligible for the April 2020 COLO payment but have not received it by May 18th, 2020 are directed to call the Canada Revenue Agency’s dedicated individual and benefits enquiries line at 1-866-426-1527.   Quote   “The NWT Cost of Living Offset payments are an important part of the Government of the Northwest Territories commitment to all territorial residents to help offset the cost of the NWT carbon tax.  The timing of the April 30th payment will provide families with a welcome boost of funds that may help reduce their financial stress as we all work to support each other through the COVID-19 health crisis.” -Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance     Quick Facts   The NWT Carbon Tax became effective September 1st, 2019 and the first  COLO payment was distributed in October 2019. The COLO benefit is not based on family income and will increase as the carbon tax rate increases. There is no need to apply for  COLO as the Canada Revenue Agency determines eligibility and issues payments to all entitled individuals and families.

These new measures cover practices like social distancing after entering the territory, symptom declarations, and other accountability and tracking measures to enhance COVID-19 protection and response in the NWT. The purpose of this shift is to put additional protections in-place to mitigate the risks inherent in welcoming out-of-territory workers who may be traveling from locations where COVID-19 community spread has occurred, and track where they are and what they’re doing when in the NWT. NWT Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola has indicated that ramping up risk reduction related to out-of-territory travel, alongside tightened border measures, are the first pieces which must fall into place as the territory looks towards a relaxing of public health measures.   Quote “There’s only one shot you get at containment, and I’m proud of the work our territory has done to achieve it. All this doesn’t happen by itself, and we still have a lot of work ahead to keep us in containment while a vaccine is developed.

They are critical to the structure and function of our communities and provide almost all of the products and services that we enjoy and rely on as Northerners.  “The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT)’s support for small business is more important given our current situation than ever before. This can be seen in person, through our pathfinders and staff working with small businesses across the NWT; in financial supports through our economic relief packages; and in our advocacy efforts on behalf of small businesses with the federal government including constant engagement with CanNor, their northern economic development agency. “Earlier this month, I endorsed on behalf of the GNWT, a letter from the NWT/NU Chamber of Mines and Yukon Chamber of Mines to the Government of Canada defining the need and level of support required by resource companies operating in the NWT.  Today, I want to ensure our business community understands that this same level of support is extended to them. “COVID-19 has already had immense impacts on our economy, our businesses, and our people. While the magnitude of these impacts is yet to be determined, we know they will exist for all companies, and federal support must be considered through a distinctly northern lens. “On behalf of the NWT’s business sector, I have, this week, supported the Yellowknife Chamber of Commerce in its lobby efforts with the Federal Government to ensure relief programs, developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect the unique realities of operating in the North. “Business, when looked at with a northern context, is not the same as in the south. Revenues and profits for our small business sector are far below those of comparable companies in southern Canada; and there are unique logistical and climatic challenges that come with successfully operating in our northern environment.  “These are challenging times, but I am confident that by working together we can move past this crisis and seize on the opportunity to build and create a stronger, healthier economy for our Territory. “I will continue to collaborate with my federal and territorial counterparts to identify economic support and recovery initiatives for the North in order to advance the wellbeing, health, and livelihoods of all Northerners.”"

These include a recent onset of:   A general feeling of unease, or being ‘under the weather’ Muscle aches Fatigue Sore throat Runny nose Headache Diarrhea Vomiting Loss of smell The GNWT has expanded its already aggressive testing strategy to include anyone experiencing a recent onset of these symptoms. Residents who are not feeling well are urged to call 8-1-1 or to take the online NWT self-assessment and follow the provided advice. Anyone experiencing severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome should call 9-1-1.   Ramping up expanded symptom testing is one component the NWT Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola says must be in-place to consider strategic relaxing of public health measures for local residents over the next 4-6 weeks.  Quote “We need your help in slowing down and containing COVID-19 to help protect our families and communities. If you are not feeling well, call 8-1-1 or take the online self-assessment and follow the provided directions. We want more people to get tested so that we can better understand this virus.

Today, Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance, and R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE), are announcing additional support for essential workers responding to COVID-19 that will ensure access to child care. The GNWT, through ECE, is providing $5.106 million to immediately create four temporary child care initiatives that will support parents providing essential services during the COVID-19 public health emergency and lessen the financial impacts on licensed family day homes and centre-based child care programs.  The initiatives include: A $1.9-million subsidy to lower child care costs by 33% for parents who are required to physically attend work and who need child care during COVID-19.  A $1,000 per month wage top-up for child care staff, to ensure both licensed family day homes and centre-based early learning and child care programs are adequately resourced to provide child care services, especially during non-regular hours, for a total value of $1.3 million.  $665,000 in additional resources to ensure licensed child care programs receive adequate support for supplies and labour to carry out enhanced cleaning regimens at child care centres, and to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff and clients.  A $1.24-million subsidy to offset a portion of the fixed costs, such as rent and utilities, for licensed early learning and child care programs that have closed due to COVID-19. While ideally child care programs will remain open as essential services wherever possible, this subsidy is designed to support the ability of programs to re-open when the health risks associated with COVID-19 have decreased.  These initiatives will prioritize direct health and allied healthcare workers, as well as any parents required to physically attend a worksite during the pandemic. ECE has also been working with the Department of Health and Social Services to match child care services with the identified needs of Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority (NTHSSA), the Hay River Health and Social Services Authority and the Tłı̨chǫ Community Services Agency staff as an additional level of support for both parents and programs. ECE staff have provided a one-stop registration process for NTHSSA employees to find available child care spots and are matching them with known vacancies in open programs. The new supports come into effect immediately, and complement the previous two waves of economic measures announced earlier this month to support people, businesses and communities in response to COVID-19, creating a total of $26.565 million in GNWT financial support announced to date.  Quotes: “Parents who are providing healthcare and other essential services in response to COVID-19 are experiencing increased child care pressures due to self-isolation and physical distancing requirements. Making new financial supports available will help to ensure parents providing essential services in response to COVID-19 are able to continue to serve and protect our territory and will lessen the financial impacts of COVID-19 on licensed family day homes and centre-based early learning and child care programs.” 						-R.J.

Simpson: News Conference, Financial Supports for Child Care during COVID-19","Check against delivery    Good afternoon.   The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many challenges for our residents and communities as we take the necessary steps to protect each other by staying physically distant and self-isolating.   For residents with children, there are additional and significant challenges now that children are at home as a result of school closures and the cancellation of many child care programs.   While some parents are able to care for their children while working from home - challenging as that may be - there are others, such as doctors, nurses, grocery store workers, water truck drivers, and so on, who must still work outside the home in order to provide the essential services that we all rely on, and that will keep the people of the Northwest Territories safe and healthy.   These essential workers are now experiencing increased child care pressures as a result of COVID-19.   Many parents who are critical frontline staff are also putting in irregular and additional hours at work in order to respond to the ever-evolving COVID-19 situation and to the increased demands on the healthcare system.   Normally, some of these pressures could be mitigated through staggered shifts, after-school programs, and care provided by friends and family.   For many parents, those options are no longer available due to the need for self-isolation and physical distancing.   Supporting access to child care for parents who are providing essential services in response to COVID-19 is critical for us to be able to address this public health emergency.   Today, I am pleased to announce over $5 million in additional funding to help those parents continue to access child care as they respond to COVID-19.   In consultation with childcare providers, the Department of Education, Culture, and Employment, and the Department of Finance have worked together to develop four (4) temporary child care programs that will support access to child care for essential workers, and will lessen the negative financial impacts of COVID-19 on licensed early learning and child care programs.   First, we will subsidize an additional 33% of the child care costs for parents who are required to physically attend work during COVID-19. This is on top of the per child subsidy that is already provided directly to childcare programs to help lower the fees they need to charge to parents.     Second, we will increase to the Staff Grant Wage Subsidy program to provide up to an additional $1,000 a month to child care workers, to ensure programs are properly resourced - especially during non-regular hours, when essential shift workers need their child care services the most.   This Staff Grant Wage Subsidy is typically only available to staff in licensed centre-based programs, but the increase will also be made available to family day home operators, so we can mitigate the impacts of lost child care fees on their program sustainability.   Third, we will make $665,000 available to licensed child care programs to be used for additional cleaning supplies and labour needed for enhanced disinfecting regimes at child care centres. This money will also be used to purchase personal protective equipment for staff and clients.    Finally, we will provide a subsidy to partially offset fixed costs, such as rent and utilities, for licensed early learning and child care programs that have closed due to COVID-19.   This is intended to prevent these costs from being passed on to parents who want to keep their child care spots at closed centres. It will also bolster the ability of programs to eventually re-open, which will be essential to our economic recovery.   We will continue to listen and respond to the needs and concerns of parents and child care providers across the territory as we move forward in our efforts to address COVID-19.   I want to thank each of our essential workers, including our child care providers, for helping us get through these unprecedented and challenging times, together.    We need each and every one of you, and will continue to find ways to support your vital efforts as you serve and protect our residents throughout the COVID-19 pandemic."
757,2020-04-24,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-opening-remarks-finance-committee-appearance,Government Website,"Caroline Wawzonek: Opening Remarks, Finance Committee Appearance ","Introduction  COVID-19 has exposed the depth of economic and social vulnerabilities in the Northwest Territories, particularly in small communities, from health care access to reliance on airlines for food security to the lack of internet connectivity in homes.  Our non-public sector economy is driven by the mineral resource industry, primarily diamonds, a luxury-good commodity market susceptible to fluctuations outside of our control. Our population has many pre-existing health vulnerabilities, low rates of educational outcomes and a recent history of both individual and collective trauma stemming in part from residential schools. COVID-19 has brought the collective impacts of these realities, and other challenges, into sharp focus. Even with all this adversity, I am proud of the way that Northwest Territories residents, businesses and governments have rallied to respect the health measures put in place to minimize COVID-19 cases and keep it out of our remote communities.  My opening comments will speak to both our challenges and our opportunities that COVID-19 has brought into sharp focus and the responses we believe are needed to build a strong, sustainable north.   Strengths Our people: The Northwest Territories is made up of strong, resilient people. We are at our best when we work together, as is demonstrated by active collaboration between public and Indigenous governments. Mineral resources: Significant mineral resource potential across the NWT’s vast geography continues to exist. Notable examples are lithium and rare earth minerals which could gain greater prominence if COVID-19 advances the conversation about increased use of technology green energy.  The NWT is a key entry point to the Arctic Ocean and the Northwest Passage: The geopolitical importance of the Arctic as well as direct economic potential is unaffected by COVID-19.  Cultural diversity: Celebrate and protect 11 official languages, each one translated in our Legislative Assembly. Cultural knowledge, particularly interest in Indigenous cultures and language, is an area of growing interest around the world.  Many of our strengths have not been diminished by COVID-19. Anecdotal evidence thus far suggests that the aggressive measures announced by the federal government combined with our own government’s support for Northwest Territories residents and businesses will do much to stabilize the immediate economic situation. We are especially appreciative of the programs targeted specifically for the North such as the $8.7 million to support NWT airlines to ensure continued supply. Challenges brought into focus by COVID-19 The NWT has the largest infrastructure deficit in Canada. We have airports that allow limited aircraft, a small handful of emergency shelters in only a few regional centres and high food insecurity. COVID-19 has highlighted and in some cases exacerbated these weaknesses.  Other examples: Education: Many schools outside of the capital rely on teachers who travel to southern Canada, or abroad, during all school breaks and many of those school districts still do not have a full complement of teachers returned after “March break.” Every school district is struggling to provide web-based schooling without sufficient access to computer hardware in homes and limited internet connectivity across the Territory. Heat and energy sources: People staying home has resulted in higher energy use in an already high cost environment. Of note, most communities rely on diesel fuel to heat their homes and often as the community’s primary electricity generation.  Lest you think the recent fuel price drop is helpful, keep in mind that fuel is purchased far in advance and sent to communities on ice roads. Fuel delivered to communities in February and March was at a much higher price than we see today. Overcrowded housing and housing insecurity leading to intransient housing puts more people into contact with one another, often simultaneously suffering from lower pre-existing health resiliency. This is a perfect environment for COVID-19 to spread.  A lack of transportation infrastructures results in communities depending on airlines for food and medical supply chains. Those airlines today are in trouble, with at least one having closed its doors already.  At present, we have limited own source revenue options. Those revenues have been further depleted by our efforts to provide immediate relief to the financial pressures created by the collective response to COVID-19. In addition, the reduction in revenue resulting from a loss in personal and corporate income as well as mineral royalties is expected to have a major impact. Although we appreciate the financial help from Canada to date, we will need more.  We already have limited fiscal room which impacts our ability to be primary investors in major projects and can create fiscal challenges to act as partners if an investment relationship is predefined.  Opportunities  We were forced to hit a pause button on regular government business and the pursuit of our Government’s priorities in order to contain COVID-19 but as we plan to restart, we have the opportunity to think about what that restart will look like, with a vision of who we want to be in the future.  We are assessing which projects are shovel ready but could be delayed due to fiscal constraints.  We also have several projects that are what I call next-stage ready. These are projects that are at some stage of design, planning or permitting. These include:  Telecommunications connectivity expansion and capacity improvement;  The expansion of hydroelectric capacity at the Taltson hydro facility with a view to moving the NWT towards cleaner energy both in homes and available to industry so that we can be leader in greener mining, for example; Exploration of the Slave Geological Province and the potential to provide the first direct transportation corridor to Nunavut;  The expansion of hydro electricity transmission lines across the south; and The introduction and expansion of community based solar and wind projects. Recommendations  Ensure sufficient borrowing flexibility and a broader diversity of infrastructure investment partnership options including opportunities for Indigenous Governments as equity partners. This includes being able to stack funding and in some cases 100% dollars;  Advance the Broadband 2020 Fund and the promise of broadband access into all homes and communities in the Northwest Territories; and Identify social and economic goals within the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework that can be funded for action immediately or funded for immediate next stage planning and commit to doing so in collaboration with the arctic and northern communities who are eager to be on par with the rest of Canada. We know that countries that invest in the Arctic see real benefits, whether from the natural resources, the access to traditional knowledge or new opportunities in communications and transportation. We believe this is true of Canada’s north as well. We look forward to a continuing partnership with Canada to achieve this goal. "

759,2020-04-23,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rent-supplement-program-enhanced-support-residents,Government Website,Rent Supplement Program Enhanced to Support Residents,"Paulie Chinna, the Minister responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation (NWTHC) is announcing that the Transitional Rent Supplement Program (TRSP) has undergone changes to make the program more responsive and accessible to NWT residents. These changes are especially important during these challenging times due to the COVID-19 pandemic where many residents are working reduced hours or have lost their jobs.  The TRSP provides rent supplement to residents renting in the private market. If residents have low-to-modest income and their shelter costs are unaffordable, they may be eligible for assistance under the program.  Notable enhancements to the program include:         5-month duration to August 31, 2020        No requirement to take an NWTHC financial counselling course        No requirement to be arrears-free        Previous participants are eligible        Minimum $100 – maximum $500/month        Simplified application – available on NWTHC website        Phone inquiries to 1-844-698 4663 (1-844-NWT-HOME) TRSP, which was previously going to be discontinued on March, 31, 2020 has been extended until August 31, 2020. The NWTHC and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) are working collaboratively to develop a rental support program called the Canada Housing Benefit, which is scheduled to be available in September 2020.  Quote:  “There are families that are struggling to pay their rent. They may not be working or may be working less. The Transitional Rent Supplement Program is good resource for families struggling to keep current with their rent payments. We need to continue to take steps to support vulnerable residents maintain housing stability.” 						- Paulie Chinna, Minister responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation   Related links:        COVID-19 Updates: NWT Housing Corporation        Government of the Northwest Territories – Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "
760,2020-04-22,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/minister-and-education-leaders-meet-share-progress-continued-learning-during-covid-19,Government Website,Minister and Education Leaders meet to share progress on continued learning during COVID-19,"The Honourable R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) met with territorial education leaders and the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) again on April 21, 2020 to discuss continued learning for Northwest Territories (NWT) students during the time of school closures as a result of COVID-19.   Leaders from all regions of the NWT joined the Minister and other ECE officials on the biweekly teleconference to discuss progress to date and share innovative work underway across regions to support teachers, parents and students with learning at home.   All schools across the NWT have begun supplying their students with at-home learning packages, either through pick-up, delivery, mail-outs or email, as a way to accommodate and support students with and without home computers and Internet access. These packages provide enough school work for one to two weeks of learning, and students can either email or drop off completed packages at schools while following protocols for physical distancing.   Where possible, schools have supplied students with laptops or tablets, and have moved their classrooms online onto platforms such as Moodle or Google Classroom. Teachers have set up virtual learning support centres, including Facebook groups and sections of their websites, to share video tutorials and other resources designed to support students and families using these new applications.   Recognizing that this is a challenging time for all families, students and teachers, many education bodies have dedicated first weeks of distance learning to supporting student and family wellness. For example, East Three Secondary and Elementary Schools in Inuvik are offering phone counselling for their students and have set up a ‘Health and Wellness’ Facebook group, while K'àlemì Dene School in Ndilǫ focused their first week of teaching on how to set up a daily routine, doing outdoor scavenger hunts and writing personal wellness plans.    Healthy foods programming continues to be made available to students outside of schools. In each region, a range of food hampers, gift cards, grocery store accounts and cooked meals are being provided to households in need, either directly or via the local Indigenous government’s food security initiatives.   With the support of ECE, teachers are continuing to follow curriculum while tailoring approaches to accommodate the new distance learning situation. These system-wide supports include new assessment tools for distance and land-based learning, with the understanding that many families are spending time on the land as a way to stay safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as temporary processes for high school course completion, links to online learning resources, helpful information on safe use of technology, and resources for parents.   To stay connected as a school community, teachers have been sharing video messages to their students over social media, holding teacher parades to greet their students from a safe distance, sharing student artwork and photos online, and hosting online school spirit days.   Schools and communities have also banded together to provide additional activities and encourage students to stay engaged from their homes through things like creative writing, reading and on-the-land photo contests. Through social media, students and families have been connected with a number of free online resources, including large selections of online books and stories, as well as educational games and activities, and mental wellness supports. There continue to be challenges that will likely persist for the remainder of the school year. The lack of home computers and Internet access, as well as the struggles that come from shifting to an at-home learning environment, are obstacles that teachers and staff, with the support of ECE, will continue to find ways to work around. Educators will continue to show flexibility and creativity in adapting their approach to providing learning and wellness supports to students during this time.   The next meeting of education leaders with Minister Simpson is scheduled for Tuesday, May 5, 2020. Quotes: “When education leaders in the Northwest Territories decided collectively to close schools for the remainder of the school year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognized the significant impact this decision would have on students, families, staff and communities, and were committed to finding options to support continued learning for all NWT students. I am deeply moved and inspired by the dedication of our hard-working educators, who have shown flexibility and creativity in adapting distance learning and wellness supports for our students to meet their wide-ranging household needs. By continuing to exchange solutions and innovations, NWT education leaders are supporting one another in providing quality at-home learning for all students during this unprecedented time.” 						-R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   “The announcement made by education bodies to close schools until the end of the school year in response to COVID-19 is unprecedented. Many questions arose about how the various education bodies and their staff would be able to accomplish the enormous task of developing plans for continuity of learning. With Minister Simpson’s guidance, ECE, education bodies and the NWTTA created the NWT Education Bulletin, which laid out the framework and expectations around continued learning. Education bodies, school principals, teachers and support staff have embraced the challenge and connected with students and families, quickly participating in professional development activities to get acquainted with different technology and platforms, and providing students with the first set of learning plans. Although we will continue to have challenges, I’d like to congratulate all of the principals, teachers and support staff for rallying together to produce these plans that not only focus on student achievement, but are also developing resiliency in each one of us. This collective effort is a testament to our NWT education system that truly has the well-being of its students, families and staff at heart.” 						-Simon Cloutier, Chair of Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, on behalf of NWT Education Leaders   Related links: Education Bulletin - March 31, 2020 For all COVID-19 Media Requests, Contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca   "
761,2020-04-22,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/health-measures-nwt-correction-facilities-response-covid-19-northwest-territories,Government Website,Health Measures at NWT Correction Facilities in Response to COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories,"Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Justice and Attorney General for the Northwest Territories, issued the following statement today in response to questions about inmates being released during the COVID-19 pandemic:  “As the Minister of Justice, the safety and well-being of our corrections staff, inmates and people of the Northwest Territories, is a top priority. Good government protects the well-being of all citizens, particularly the most vulnerable.  The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is aware of the particular challenges and risks that COVID-19 poses to NWT Correctional Facilities and continues to take steps to manage and mitigate these risks.  “To keep everyone safe and healthy it’s imperative we keep our incarcerated population safe. Our corrections facilities do not operate in isolation from our community. The flow of individuals entering our facilities, including workers and medical staff, can make these institutions more vulnerable to infection.  “The government’s approach has had two parts: first, safely reduce the number of people in our facilities and, second, ensure that the procedures in place to assess the health of those entering the correctional facilities rely on the best available medical evidence and techniques.  “The strategic and safe release of low-risk offenders and supporting the process by which individuals facing charges can await disposition of their matters on judicial interim release, are our best options as we work to prevent the spread of COVID-19 inside our corrections facilities, and across our territory. This initiative needs to be done carefully, thoughtfully - and most importantly - safely.  “The World Health Organization, the Canadian Bar Association, and the Canadian Human Rights Commission, among others, have all recommended governments decrease the number of inmates wherever it is safe to do so. To date, our response has been one of the most successful nationally, resulting in a reduction of approximately 22% in the number of inmates in our facilities. By reducing the population, we reduce the level of stress placed on our staff, allow those within the facility to more easily practice physical distancing, and reduce travel between NWT correctional facilities and peoples’ home communities.  “The use of early releases or Temporary Absence is in line with existing law and policy to reintegrate those who have completed a statutory period of incarceration and who meet criteria to begin their return to the community. What has changed is our emphasis on the availability of this process and the priority given to processing these applications. Offenders are not released without plans for their reintegration into the community which includes a place to reside. The majority of individuals have family homes to return to and without a place to reside an offender will not be approved for an early release.   “In addition to early releases, the Department of Justice is working with our partners in the justice system to ensure we only send individuals to jail who need to be there to ensure public safety. The legal process of seeking judicial interim release (a.k.a. “bail”) has not changed. What has changed is a more collaborative approach to determining if an individual meets the legal standard of posing a risk to public safety. The final decision on whether an individual will be released on bail rests with the Courts. As well, the delivery of judicial interim release hearings by telecommunications means that people can remain in their home communities and reduce the need to travel for their hearings.    “For those who are denied bail or are sentenced to a period of incarceration, the Department of Justice has implemented a number of safety precautions across our facilities to ensure that the health and safety of everyone entering the building is protected. All protocols are in line with direction provided by the Chief Public Health Officer.  “All new intakes to our facilities are properly screened, questioned and must be medically cleared by our health staff prior to being introduced to the general population. Our testing protocols are in line with those of the Chief Public Health Officer’s office, and while we don’t currently require all new inmates to be tested for COVID-19, our medical clearance process does include a temperature check and rigorous medical-specific questioning.  As well, staff and anyone else entering are also required to undergo screening before entering any of our facilities.   “So far, thanks to the dedication and diligence of our staff and healthcare professionals and measures implemented by the Chief Public Health Officer we’ve been able to protect our staff, health workers and inmates from the virus. No one at any of our facilities has become infected.  “The GNWT understand that this global health pandemic is fluid, and as this situation evolves, the department’s response will continue to evolve too.”    "

But as we respond to COVID-19, it’s important we both look at the facts, and remember our history.  We know that there are second and perhaps even third waves in Canada expected before we get a vaccine.  We know from history, those additional waves are often more deadly and widespread than the first. So even if Canada’s first curve flattens, we are far from through this.  And the fact is, the biggest risk to our territory is the situation across Canada – and right now, Canada’s cases continue to grow significantly each day in spite of testing rates far lower than our own.  The only way for us to keep our territory in containment through three waves across Canada is to be very careful in how we manage our response over this time.  We understand that our current levels of restriction cannot remain forever, but we also need to be very deliberate in how we weigh all of the evidence.  We are looking at infection rates, deaths, regional outbreaks, transmission dynamics, growing worries about asymptomatic spread, and rapidly evolving research we are getting all the time.  And from that data, we are looking at ways loosening our restrictions only where it makes the most sense.  We are formulating a plan for moving forward with all the information we have, and will be speaking in greater detail in the near future. "

Frontline workers at airports and enforcement checkpoints, as well as wildlife officers and healthcare workers are at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are proven to help reduce the spread of the virus. As in the rest of Canada and world, hand sanitizer is in short supply in the Northwest Territories due to increased demand during this health crisis. The GNWT has a responsibility to protect its frontline workers that are providing essential services to northerners during this public health emergency. By providing our workers with a reliable supply of hand sanitizer, we can help ensure their safety without depleting the publicly-available (commercial) supply of this critical product. QUOTES “I am incredibly grateful to all our frontline workers, including our officers, airport staff and healthcare workers, for the important work they are doing during this health crisis. Our experts at Taiga Lab are happy to be able to support them by providing a reliable supply of hand sanitizer to help keep their hands clean and reduce the spread of COVID-19. We are all in this together, and we all have a role to play in protecting our families, our elders and our communities.” 				-Shane Thompson, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources  				  “In our response to the COVID-19 crisis, we need to use every source at our disposal to make sure our territory is ready to meet the moment. Our frontline staff can now rest a little easier knowing one of the most essential goods in their workplaces is free from the whims of the global supply chain thanks to Taiga Labs. We salute Taiga Labs for their work in making gel hand sanitizer for clinical use. We are also grateful to 62 Degrees North in stepping up to provide hand sanitizer for general use, which is critically important for essential retailers, childcare providers and residents to protect the NWT against the spread of COVID-19.” 				Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services  				  QUICK FACTS Taiga Lab is part of the GNWT Department of Environment and Natural Resources. It is the only full-service environmental analytical laboratory north of 60. The lab has state-of-the-art lab equipment, a complete lab facility, lab technicians, quality control and quality assurance personnel, as well as a chemist on staff. Taiga Lab received authorization from the Chief Public Health Officer to produce hand sanitizer, as well as a site licence and a product licence from Health Canada. The lab is able to produce up to 300 litres of hand sanitizer a day, if required. Sourcing the ingredients to produce hand sanitizer, as well as pump bottles to dispense the sanitizer, has been challenging due to worldwide shortages. So far, Taiga Lab has produced more than 1,700 litres of hand sanitizer for GNWT frontline workers.

All rent would still be payable by the tenant when their circumstances change, or when the current pandemic circumstances ease and the temporary regulation is revoked. In addition to non-payment of rent, the temporary regulation also suspends a landlord's ability to evict a tenant for a number of other reasons outlined in the Act.  Landlords may still apply to a rental officer for an eviction order after giving a tenant 10 days’ notice of eviction for reasons such as the tenant has caused repeated unreasonable disturbance of other tenant's use of the property, or has caused damage to the property and not followed orders to repair the damage, or if the safety of the landlord or other tenants has been seriously impaired by the tenant and other lease requirements.  The full Residential Tenancies (COVID-19) Regulations are available here:  https://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/en/files/legislation/residential-tenancies/residential-tenancies.r2.pdf   Quotes ""These are unprecedented times due to the global health pandemic, and we know there are going to be people who find themselves in a situation where they are unable to pay their rent in full and on time.

Both extensions takes effect as of April 15, 2020 and expire April 28, 2020. Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services extended the territory-wide Public Health Emergency which was first extended on April 1 under the Northwest Territories’ Public Health Act. Premier Caroline Cochrane, in her capacity of Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs extended the territory-wide state of emergency under the Emergency Management Act. These extensions are due to the continued need for response to the COVID-19 global pandemic to protect public health in the Northwest Territories. The Public Health Emergency was extended on the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola. The declaration of a Public Health Emergency allows the Chief Public Health Officer to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic. Dr. Kandola has instituted a ban on indoor gatherings, limited outside get-togethers to less than 10 people with strict social distancing of two metres maintained, ordered the closure of certain businesses and issued strict guidance to those wishing to remain open, and ordered processes and procedures for continued operation at remote work camps in the NWT. The extension of the Public Health Emergency allows for the appropriate implementation of these new health protection measures. Thus far, the Northwest Territories has only imported cases related to travel with no evidence of community spread. Keeping ahead of the spread is the best way to stay as close to this trajectory possible, and is one way to limit the time strict measures are required for NWT residents. Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably across Canada. Nationwide spread is the biggest risk of expanding spread within the Northwest Territories.  The extension of the State of Emergency has been made in order to ensure the Emergency Management Organization (EMO) continues to be in a position to support the orders issued by the Chief Public Health Officer. Extending the State of Emergency does not indicate a significant change in circumstances or an increased risk to the people of the NWT. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) continues to enhance our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an ongoing effort to protect the health of the residents of the Northwest Territories. All residents are reminded to follow these orders and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer during this challenging time."

Let’s talk for a moment about what these orders actually mean, and how we’re going to implement them The most important thing we all can to flatten the covid-19 curve is to practice physical distancing. This is something that Dr. Teresa Tam  CPHO for Canada has recommended for all Canadians. Our order on gatherings will allow private gatherings outside of no more than 10 people Provided physical distancing of 6 feet apart canoccur.  This order restricts  indoor private gatherings to only people in your immediate household. That is those you live with. Public gatherings are prohibited both indoors and outdoors  And if you’re on-the-land,  a tent or cabin is the same as your  house – no visitors from outside your household . However, you can go out on the land with others  – Just  keep six feet apart like you would at the grocery store or in public These limitations are necessary  because any time you increase number of people you are in contact with  the virus can pass to others.   We all need to keep our circles small to contain the spread. I recognize this is going to be a huge adjustment for Northwest Territories residents who enjoy having friends over for dinner and parties.   And it could put strain on relationships – where it may be difficult to stay physically apart for so long.  It is not lost on me that this will impact mental health. So what I encourage everyone to do is get creative. We’ve seen churches offering online sermons. We’re seeing people using Zoom or Google hangouts to have long chats with their friends. We’re seeing groups starting up on Facebook where people are having virtual kitchen parties to keep connected, and have some laughs. With the warmer weather and longer days-  go outdoors.  And if you need help, our health authorities are still delivering mental health services, so get in touch, and get help.  This order also mandates the closing of several kinds of businesses where proper social distancing is not possible because of the way they must operate.  These businesses are:    Tourism Operators Bottle Depots; Gyms and fitness centers; Museums and art galleries; Bars and night clubs; Theatres and movie theatres; Dine-in portions of restaurants; and  Personal service establishments I will now go through some of the exceptions in this  order.  This order excludes workers and workplaces if you’re an essential service, or a sector supporting essential services – like healthcare workers, some government services, or daycares and day homes.  It excludes facilities offering health and social services support to at-risk communities, like sobering centres and shelters.  It excludes retailers like grocery stores, gas stations, banks, and pharmacies considered to be essential to the continued function of our territory.  It excludes liquor stores, because, in the short term,  withdrawal and non-consumable alcohol consumption  amongst those experiencing addiction endangers public health more than keeping them open will.   Businesses not already mandated to close who are able to modify operations to ensure proper social distancing may also stay open, but they are not specifically excluded.  We reserve the right to revisit this, but I will say I’ve been impressed with the ingenuity of our business community’s response to COVID-19. Touchless methods of delivery, video and other ingenious methods have been great. Our order on remote work camps largely strengthens  the good practices we already recommended weeks ago, and our worksites have generally complied with already.  We are putting legal force behind them now as we understand the anxieties of our residents, and now have the enforcement capacity to address them.  These measures include things like: mandating health screenings before each shift and before coming to site;  immediate self-isolation onsite if showing symptoms; not allowing those who have symptoms to work;  social distancing measures on-and-off-rotation;  and ending buffet-style catering.  We have also made it mandatory to keep risk assessments on every employee, and allow for them to be inspected by WSCC when required.  I would like to thank everyone in our territory who has followed our recommendations over the past month. I encourage everyone to keep doing   all that you can to flatten the Covid-19 curve.   And I would like to commit to NWT residents that we will be working around-the-clock to make sure these orders work, and our communities are protected.  Thank you. "

As the spread of COVID-19 crossed our nation and touched our communities, our message has always been that our public health measures will get stronger before they let up.  And with the leadership of our Chief Public Health Officer, we have moved forward with some of the most aggressive policies in the country.  We closed our boundaries before almost anyone else.  We mandated isolation near hospitals to protect our remote communities.  We test those without connections to travel. And today, we are taking more steps to protect our families, our friends, and our communities.  Dr. Kandola has ordered all indoor gatherings across the territory to be cancelled effective tomorrow. .  Gatherings are things like house parties, funerals, church mass or spiritual congregations, feasts – any event that brings together people who do not already live together.  She has also limited outdoor gatherings to less than 10 people, and mandated social distancing for any of these which may occur.  While we provided this advice weeks ago, we are now confident it is necessary to put legal weight behind these measures to respond to this unprecedented threat.  Dr. Kandola has also ordered that certain kinds of businesses must close for the time being. This is once again a matter of putting legal force behind what our business community was already implementing as a recommendation.  And Dr. Kandola is also ordering strict screening, tracking, and protection measures at mining and oil and gas sites in the Northwest Territories effective today.  These Orders will be enforced by our Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce announced Wednesday. We are better equipped than ever to respond and investigate if our orders are not followed, and public health is put at-risk.  I am confident in Dr. Kandola, and her approach to protecting our territory.  It has served us well thus far.  But we must not get complacent. We are in this for months, not weeks, and if we aren’t all on the same team, it could be a lot longer.  So know that if you aren’t cancelling parties; if you’re still having friends over; if you’re not washing your hands, keeping six feet between each other, avoiding others as much as you can, and self-isolating if you feel sick at all, then you’re not doing your part.  And if you don’t respond to education and warnings, we’re coming for you.  I would like to hand it over to Minister Nokleby. "

The Government of the Northwest Territories recognize this.   We acknowledge that it is happening at a cost to business owners and entrepreneurs in the North; and we will continue to seek out, identify, and facilitate ways to support your efforts and address these challenges. Today, Dr. Kandola is implementing new orders around Mining and Oil and Gas. These companies have worked closely with our public health officials to implement many of these measures as advice already.   I want to emphasize that these are not measures that begin today. This mine order captures many of the precautions and safety protocols that mineral and petroleum companies have already put in place through their own efforts, and following the guidance of Public Health Officials from across the country. I want to thank our resource companies in particular for working with us and taking extraordinary measures to protect their workforce and to committing to operate safely for as long as they can.   Through this COVID-19 pandemic, our resources companies have proven themselves to be strong corporate citizens, and protocols have been in place to ensure the health and safety of our residents.  For instance, all transient employees entering the Northwest Territories are being screened with temperature testing, questionnaires, and pre-departure screening calls.  If an employee or contractor shows signs of illness or has a higher exposure risk, they are told to remain at home.  Charter aircraft flights have been introduced as much as possible to separate the travel of northern and southern workers and to reduce or eliminate interactions with commercial airline travellers. Charter flights protocols now include enhanced cleaning of aircraft, changes to or elimination of food and beverage services, and physical distancing measures. On sites, companies have been following enhanced hygiene and cleaning awareness and practices for several weeks now. Social distancing measures have been incorporated for safety meetings, transportation, all work spaces, and in dining halls and accommodations. As much as possible, southern workers are being segregated from northern workers.  All operators have also established dedicated quarantine facilities and practices.   Companies will quarantine and treat any worker with COVID-19 symptoms. Medical personnel are on site to deal with situations that occur, and there will be no hesitation in using medevac services should advance medical care be deemed necessary.  Our resource companies have worked to inform their immediate staff of the precautions that are being taken.  They have also worked to inform their communities and Indigenous IBA partners regularly, as well as reach out to see what the community needs are and help in the ways that they can during these tough times.    Similarly, the Premier and I have also taken steps to inform and advise our territory’s leaders of the extraordinary steps and initiatives being taken at these sites. The situation is evolving quickly across Canada which is why these additional measures are needed. By implementing these orders, we continue to ensure the right precautions are in-place to protect NWT residents from the risks of having a southern transient workforce entering the territory. It is our goal to reduce the risks that exists from COVID-19. We recognize that this is and will be as much of an economic crisis as it is a health one. But we are assured that the precautions that are being taken mean our remote work sites are as safe as they can be.   With the restrictions and considerations that have been put in place, our government is supportive of continued operations at worksites that have chosen to follow this path.  I would also like to recognize the importance of the resource sector to the North, now and in the future.  This includes not just our mining industry, but also our advanced project and exploration companies.   I want to reassure businesses and residents that the Government of the Northwest Territories understands the challenges you are faced with and takes this situation very seriously.   Safety is our number one priority, but next to that is ensuring that our economy remains healthy and people feel secure.  I would now like to turn it over to Dr. Kandola to explain the details of the Orders being addressed today. "

The announcement comes after forming a new Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce to track down and investigate complaints about those not following the rules of the Public Health Act or public health Orders.  Order on Mines and Oil and Gas Remote Camps to Protect Against the COVID-19 Pandemic Dr. Kandola has ordered several measures to protect public health and continue safe operations at all mining and oil and gas projects in the Northwest Territories.  The measures apply to all companies and employers operating in the sectors – parent corporations and contractors alike.  Several measures also apply to employees. This order excludes the Giant Mine Remediation project in Yellowknife. If this site is not staffed appropriately, the territory risks significant environmental damage.  The Order is effective as of 12pm on Friday April 10.     Order Bans All Gatherings, Formalizes Closure of Certain Businesses Dr. Kandola bans all indoor gatherings effective April 11. A gathering is defined as a group of people of any size who do not live in the same household who are not able to maintain social (physical) distance indoors.  This means no visitors inside any home. And it means if you are helping care for someone in your community, you must limit your time inside their living space to an absolute minimum.  This would include activities like:  House parties Funerals Meetings  Feasts  Church services  Team sports   Gathering of up to 10 people will be allowed only outdoors as long as social (physical) distance of at least two metres (six feet) can be maintained. This distance must be maintained throughout the duration of these activities.  Additionally, the advice on certain businesses closing has now been clarified and turned into an enforceable Order.  While our business community has cooperated and closed based on our advice, this Order will formalize this requirement and also ensure no businesses face barriers when applying for relief from the federal government.    For all COVID-19 media requests, please contact:  Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Presssecretary@gov.nt.ca"

There is no avoiding the economic impacts that we are challenged with, but we can look at the resources available to find creative ways to minimize the long-term impacts this virus will have on our territory, and these sectors. “The Chamber of Mines has submitted a letter seeking federal government support, specifically as it pertains to the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program – one of the resources available to businesses during this time. Like many of the benefits implemented by the Federal government in response to Covid-19, this benefit is intended to support businesses that are struggling. “The Federal government has done a great job implementing measures to support Canadians and businesses during COVID-19, but in this instance may not be aware of our unique northern challenges meeting the eligibility requirements. I have read the letter sent to the Federal government by the two Chambers of Mines and can confirm that our government is committed to working with them to further highlight the unique needs and interests of the North. “The mineral development sector is essential across the all three territories. Mining and exploration is the biggest source of private sector jobs and income for our residents and has been the heart of our economy for decades. It is imperative that we continue to support it. “I want to reassure businesses and residents that the Government of the Northwest Territories takes your concerns very seriously and is working hard to support our people. Safety is our number one priority, but next to that is ensuring that our economy remains healthy and people feel secure. “We don’t know the full impacts that this virus will have on our economy, but I do know that helping our economy rebound from COVID-19 will take time. By working together with our stakeholders, Indigenous governments, business community, and more, I am confident we will get through this and come out stronger on the other side.”  "

After careful consideration, the GNWT will not be closing liquor stores at this point in time. Although closing liquor stores seems like it would remove dangerous behaviours, research tells us that removing access to alcohol is likely to create hardship for persons already struggling with addictions and potentially increase the burden on the NWT health care system at a time when its capacity to manage potential COVID-19 cases must be maintained. The GNWT’s current approach to managing the sale of alcohol is a coordinated and reasonable approach that will continue to allow access to liquor and cannabis in the NWT.  To address potential concerns related to their operation, the Northwest Territories Liquor and Cannabis Commission and operators of the NWT’s liquor stores have made adjustments to their operating hours and sales practices to ensure that customers and staff are safe and able to practice social distancing while in the stores. The GNWT is also examining how best to implement specific changes to the Liquor Regulations that would allow for a variety of temporary adjustments to further reflect current realities and social distancing requirements.   The decision about how to manage alcohol in individual communities is one that is best made by individual communities.  There are a variety of tools already available in the Liquor Act that provide communities with the ability to make decisions about how to manage alcohol within their boundaries, including Temporary Prohibition Orders.  Quote “Our healthcare system, police and emergency first responders are working hard to address the realities created by COVID-19.  At this time, it is our job to minimize potential additional stresses on these systems.  Although on the surface it seems that closing liquor stores would remove dangerous behaviours, research tells us that removing access to alcohol during the emergency response to COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate the addiction-related health and social wellness challenges that we face throughout the territory every day.” -        Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance Quick Facts ·       There are currently 15 NWT communities that have plebiscite-approved liquor restrictions or prohibition measures reflected in enforceable regulations. ·       The GNWT is currently working with the communities of Aklavik, Tsiigehtchic, Tuktoyaktuk, and Tulita to enact temporary prohibition orders. ·       Enforcement of Liquor Act-related offences will be identified in the Minister of Justice’s Ministerial Police Priorities.

There has been much discussion around access to liquor stores and liquor products during COVID 19. I want to say to residents that the GNWT has no intention of closing liquor stores during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We have weighed the pros and cons, looked to the experience of jurisdictions across Canada and heard many different voices on this issue and have decided that removing all lawful access to alcohol would simply do more harm than good.   Not only would removing access to legal alcohol create hardships for persons already struggling with addiction, it would potentially increase the burden on our NWT health care system at a time when it must remain focussed on fighting this pandemic. Sudden and forced withdrawal for those with any level of dependence on alcohol would hae impacts on police, medical first responders and the health care system at large from mental health to physical detox impacts.  We also recognize that decisions about how to manage alcohol within a community is one that I would like encourage be made by community leadership.  The NWT Liquor Act provides a variety of tools to municipal and band governments to allow them to make decisions about what will best respond to the specific needs of their residents.  The Northwest Territories has 15 communities who, before this pandemic began, put in place some form of alcohol restriction or prohibition system.  These restriction or prohibition systems remain in effect.   Additionally, the Department of Finance has been working closely with those communities who request the enactment of a temporary prohibition order.  To date, we have received requests from four communities to put these temporary orders in place.  The option of requesting a temporary prohibition order is available to all NWT communities that do not have liquor stores or licensed establishments.   The Northwest Territories Liquor and Cannabis Commission has been in regular contact  with liquor store owners to ensure that liquor store staff and customers are able to follow the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer and practice social distancing while in the store.  We are also examining how best to implement specific changes to the Liquor Regulations that would allow us to make a variety of temporary adjustments related to the sale of liquor that will reflect our current economic realities, the impact on the hospitality industry, support the advisory for people to stay home and encourage social distancing.

As the Premier said, these are unprecedented times.  We put a name on it three weeks ago when we called a Public Health Emergency.  In declaring this emergency, we empowered the Northwest Territories Chief Public Health Officer to take the necessary extraordinary steps to meet this challenge, and protect our territory.  We’ve restricted entry in our territory, mandated self-isolation for residents returning to the NWT, and moved aggressively to educate people on behaviors they should practice and why we all must be in this together.  And to the thousands of residents across this territory who have been with us on our measures – embracing social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and changing how they live – from the bottom of my heart, thank you.  But we’re in this for the long-haul. This will be months, not weeks. And it is clear our steps must get bolder in order to meet this crisis head on.  The unfortunate reality, is that there will be a minority of people who will not walk with us. Education and awareness alone are never enough for some people.  The careless actions of this minority put our families, our friends and our communities at a higher risk.  And the compliance and enforcement taskforce will see to it - that this is not tolerated.  We’re expanding our enforcement efforts to strengthen Dr. Kandola’s orders where necessary, and protect everyone in our territory.  Our footprint will grow to encompass all 33 communities.  This taskforce will coordinate across government and other agencies as we continue to respond to this crisis.  But even with this expanded footprint, we must remember it needs to be a community effort to get the most out of our public health measures.  So today, I call on leadership across the territory to join us in building a culture of compliance in our communities.  That means making sure everyone knows you need to be in self-isolation if you’ve been tested or you’re sick.  It means reminding folks not to stand so close in the general store, and wearing cloth masks when around people. It means letting your friends know parties aren’t OK right now, and suggesting a group chat on-line instead.  It’s about telling people to wash their hands like crazy.  And it’s about making sure folks aren’t going out in big groups’ on-the-land and not keeping their distance.  In a perfect world, charges wouldn’t be necessary.  But this government will not stand down when the actions of a few, put others in danger. I strongly urge all residents to pay heed and follow Dr. Kandola’s current orders and any she may decide are needed in the days ahead, and get on the same team as we rise to this challenge together.  Thank you. "

Today we’re here to talk to media and residents about how the Government of the Northwest Territories will enforce orders made by the Chief Public Health Officer to protect NWT residents and communities.  For weeks now, responding to the impacts of COVID-19 has been the top priority for government officials all across this country and across the world.  COVID-19 is a global pandemic, a public health emergency that needs to be taken seriously.  In the Northwest Territories, we are taking this very seriously, and our decisions reflect that.  For nearly a month now, the Chief Public Health Officer has been issuing advice and direction to protect the health and safety of our residents.  During this time, returning residents have been required to self-isolate in regional centres and file self-isolation plans. All residents have also been asked to stay home, to stop planning or participating in mass gatherings, to cancel their parties and trips, and to adhere to social distancing precautions.  In a short amount of time, these measures have had a tremendous impact on our territory. I know our economy is suffering and people want to go back to work and normal life, but these measures have also proven to be successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in our territory – for now.  Now is not the time to loosen the measures set in place by the Chief Public Health Officer, but rather to emphasize their importance and be extra diligent.  This virus is a threat to the health of all NWT residents and our government is committed to taking strong action to protect our people and communities, as reflected in the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer While we expect all residents to do the responsible thing and follow the directions of Dr. Kandola, we also need to be prepared to enforce those orders when it is necessary.  The formation of the NWT Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce being announced today will strengthen the territory’s ability to enforce the measures put in place to protect the public health of all NWT residents.  We all want the same thing – to protect our families and loved ones from the threat of COVID-19. We all have to do our part, even when that means cancelling our plans and giving up our usual activities.  That may not be easy, but it is the right thing to do and I’m calling on all NWT residents to do it for the people they love. Do it for your grandparents, do it for your mom and dad, do it for your kids or your nieces and nephews.  The decisions we make now, will impact the decisions we have to make in the days and weeks that follow.  The Government of the Northwest Territories has been preparing for this pandemic for weeks now and making sure it has all the tools it needs to protect the health of our residents. The taskforce being announced today is another important tool that will ensure we are able to enforce the orders that our Chief Public Health Officer has made to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and lessen its impact on our people and communities.  I am pleased to welcome this new team and offer them my full support.  Thank you."

Overseeing this collaborative effort is consistent with my responsibilities to provide overall management and direction to the Executive Branch of the Government of the Northwest Territories, as set out in the Executive and Indigenous Affairs Establishment Policy.  As Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs, I will be responsible for providing leadership and direction to the Emergency Management Organization, which is responsible for coordinating the GNWT’s emergency management activities. In this role, I will be working closely with Associate Deputy Minister Russ Neudorf and EMO Director Ivan Russell to provide all our support to the Chief Public Health Officer and ensure the entire government is working to implement and enforce her orders to protect public health.  COVID-19 is a serious challenge to the Northwest Territories, and to the world. But it is a challenge we can meet together.  Under the leadership of the Chief Public Health Officer, our government started preparing for this weeks before the global pandemic was declared. The measures we have put in place, at the direction of Dr. Kandola, have been put in place to protect our residents and our communities. We cannot prevent COVID-19 from coming to our territory and our communities, but we must all play a role in slowing its spread and managing its impact on our people.  We all must follow the direction of Dr. Kandola to stay home, avoid unnecessary outings, and stay connected online or by telephone while maintaining physical distance. Whether we are sick or healthy, we need to wash our hands, avoid touching our faces and cough into our elbows.  These are simple actions, but these are the actions that will help protect our friends and our loved ones, especially those who are most vulnerable. In the south we are seeing the devastating consequences of what happens when people choose not to take precautions. I want to reiterate that responding to COVID-19 is a team effort and will require the full effort of every Minister and every department. Each Minister will continue to be responsible for doing their part to help us all combat COVID-19 and I continue to have confidence in our whole team.  Thank you. I’ll open the floor to questions now. "

She is an expert in protecting public health and the decisions she is making are going to protect NWT residents in both large and small communities.  I understand that people are very concerned about their health and safety. The GNWT is very concerned too. That is why we have taken the steps we have to protect residents over the past three weeks.  And although we have seen an increase in COVID cases this week, we can’t forget this important fact: that the measures to protect all our communities worked.   All four individuals isolated at home and followed the direction of our Chief Public Health Officer.  Because of this, we were able to make sure the communities were not put at risk and contact was minimal.  The plans we made to treat individuals with COVID-19 were put into action and we were able to offer testing and treatment that met the needs of each individual, safely -- without creating risk for the communities or anybody in them.  What we’ve seen across the globe is that this virus doesn’t care who you are, or where you’re from. It doesn’t know town limits, and it doesn’t know boundaries.  For that reason, if we’re acting differently simply because a virus is in a particular community, we are not doing our job properly.  The only way we can slow the spread is by getting ahead of it. And the only way we get ahead of it, is by acting like we all have it, and changing our behaviours 100 percent of the time.  We all need to support the work of Dr. Kandola and follow her direction. Her advice is for everybody. It is not just for sick people and it is not just for communities where we know the virus is.  The only way we can slow the spread of this virus and protect our families and communities is for everybody to do what the Chief Public Health Officer says. Stop social gatherings, don’t go anywhere you don’t need to, practice social distancing at all time, wash your hands frequently, and follow healthy respiratory practices. These are the best tools we have to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. I can’t stress this enough -- we all have to do this. We can’t be lazy about it and we can’t cut corners because we haven’t heard about cases in our communities. These are rules for everybody. These are the rules that will keep us safe. So we must be courageous. We must trust our medical professionals. We must be kind and compassionate toward each other. And most importantly, we must work together to slow the spread of this virus. "

Once again, we have some unhappy news that we’re here to discuss: the confirmation of two additional COVID-19 cases in the Northwest Territories, including our first case in a small community.  I know that people are concerned for their health, especially the people in small communities.  I also know that people are concerned to know if COVID-19 is in your community.  I hear that concern and I respect it, but I want to reassure all residents – whatever community they live in – that the Government of the Northwest Territories is doing everything possible to protect you from COVID-19.  Knowing what communities COVID-19 is in will not make you safer. What makes you safer is respecting the orders the Chief Public Health Officer has given to help keep all NWT residents safe. This does not mean we can stop COVID-19 from entering the territory or from reaching small communities.  But it does mean that we can make sure that we have the right measures in place to slow the spread in whatever community it is in.  And it does mean that we have plans to provide safe and appropriate treatment to those people who need it, regardless of where in the NWT you are located.  The measures that Dr. Kandola has implemented – especially the direction for travellers and people with symptoms to self-isolate – are the measures that will keep COVID-19 from spreading to our people.  And when people do get sick, our health and social services system and the people who work in it are ready to provide the care that those people need…safely, and without creating additional risk for the patient, the community or our staff.  I want to thank and acknowledge these people who are putting themselves at the service of all residents of the NWT right now.  We are all disappointed that COVID-19 has been discovered in more communities this week, but we should not be surprised by that fact. COVID-19 is everywhere in the world, it is here in Canada, and it is here in the Northwest Territories.  But we do not have to be discouraged by that. We have been preparing for weeks in the NWT and we know what we have to do to help flatten the curve and slow the spread in our communities.  We need everyone – everyone – to follow the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer. Be vigilant on behalf of yourselves and your loved ones. Stay home, maintain physical distance, but stay connected and support each other online or by telephone. We need to be on top of hand washing, cough into our elbows and do our best to not touch our faces.  To all people who have fallen ill this week I want to say that our thoughts are with you, and I wish you well. "
785,2020-04-03,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/leaders-north-slave-region-issue-statement-illegal-harvest-bathurst-caribou,Government Website,Leaders from the North Slave Region Issue Statement on Illegal Harvest of Bathurst Caribou,"The Minister of Environment and Natural Resources (ENR), Shane Thompson, together with Tłı̨chǫ Grand Chief George Mackenzie, Łutsel Kʼe Dene First Nation Chief Darryl Marlowe, and other Indigenous regional leaders, issued a joint statement today to reinforce the need for responsible harvesting of caribou in this time of rapid herd decline: ENR officers determined that more than 80 caribou were killed illegally within the Mobile Core Bathurst Caribou Management Zone over the past two weeks. Wasted meat and parts from 12 more caribou were also discovered outside the zone last weekend. “Working together, the decision was made to close the harvest of Bathurst caribou and put in place a mobile no-hunting zone to protect the herd,” said the leaders. “Hunters should not be harvesting in this zone, given the fragile state of the Bathurst herd.” “It is also disappointing to see animals being wasted in this way. This behaviour is not only disrespectful—it is illegal.” The Bathurst caribou herd has declined by 98 per cent since 1986. Only 8,200 caribou remain. The Mobile Zone was put in place in 2015 to protect the herd. No hunting is allowed inside this zone. ENR officers seized meat and issued tickets to hunters caught over the weekend. Prior to March 21, there had only been one case of harvesting in the mobile zone this winter. Leaders also expressed concern about the health and safety of hunters. People across the Northwest Territories are currently being asked to practice social distancing and avoid close contact to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This virus is especially dangerous for elders in small and isolated communities. Over the weekend, hunters along the winter road were observed travelling and gathering and visiting in groups. This behaviour goes against the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer, who supports people going out on the land, but only with their immediate family or people they live with. “We understand this is a difficult and uncertain time for everyone,” said Minister Thompson. “It is up to all of us to ensure we are making good decisions to protect the health and safety of our communities and the future of our caribou. There are other animals that can be legally harvested at this time, including moose, muskox, fish, small game and other caribou herds. We encourage people to look at other options, and to harvest other animals respectfully and sustainably.” ENR will continue to actively monitor the Mobile Zone through daily air and ground patrols and enforce the no-hunting rule to protect the Bathurst caribou herd."

This extension is due to the continued need for response to the COVID-19 global pandemic to protect public health in the Northwest Territories. The Public Health Emergency was extended upon the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola. The declaration of a Public Health Emergency allows the Chief Public Health Officer to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic. Since the first emergency was declared, Dr. Kandola has instituted strict travel prohibitions for non-residents with limited exceptions. Dr. Kandola’s focus continues to be on controlling the spread over the next 60 days. With two cases now confirmed, the need to continue to follow Dr. Kandola’s orders and recommendations is even more urgent. All residents must come together to embrace social distancing by canceling parties, funerals, and other gatherings; keep at least two metres between themselves and others, and wash their hands frequently to slow the spread of the virus. Under the Act, Public Health Emergencies may last up to 14 days. However, if the risk to public health remains, the Minister may extend a Public Health Emergency, as often as necessary, by a maximum of 14 days for each extension. Dr. Kandola has indicated she will continue to recommend extensions to the Public Health Emergency until the situation has changed considerably within Canada."

Just before this press conference, I was informed we have confirmed a second case of COVID-19 in the NWT.  We issued a Public Health Advisory as soon as the patient was notified, and we had enough facts to communicate to the public.  We apologize about the late notice, and we understand this would ideally have been done in person.  In the spirit of transparency and immediacy our residents expect, it was essential we put this out as soon as possible. And there was simply no time to arrange a change in format.  Some details on this second case. The individual is self-isolated in their home in Inuvik along with members of their household. They are doing well with mild symptoms and it is not expected hospitalization will be required.  Our investigation determines the individual traveled to British Columbia. They returned to Inuvik on March 21 and went into immediate self-isolation  consistent with our order.  They developed symptoms five days after their return and showed no symptoms during their flight back.  The entire household has been under mandatory isolation along with them since March 21. This strict adherence to our orders on isolation is an example all residents in our territory should follow.  We will be continuing our investigation to identify whether there are any further contacts.  Some updates on testing and investigations.  Currently in the Northwest Territories, we have completed 979 tests, with two confirmed cases.    Our contact tracing indicates all tracked contacts of our first confirmed case have tested negative. This is good news, and a reminder of what a difference social distancing can make.  These are measures we must maintain for the foreseeable future.  To that end, I have recommended to the Minister, and she has signed an order, extending the Public Health Emergency for a further 14 days – the maximum amount it can be extended each time.  I would like to remind all residents that the Health and Social Services Website is the source for truthful information on the progression of COVID-19.  My promise to residents is that this information will be updated daily, and that we will notify residents of any new cases once the appropriate patient notification is complete.  And I would like to remind residents that rumors damage our response.  Your friend from town does not have better information than our public health professionals.  And when we spend time investigating these rumors because we have a mandate to make sure, we are taking time away from our response.  I would now like to comment on some prevention concerns.  We are receiving reports of community funerals and other gatherings continuing to take place in spite of our advice to cancel all gatherings.   These are events where a lot of people get together. They often attract elders, who are more at risk of serious complications and death from COVID-19.  And it’s not just funerals. Bringing people together physically from outside of your regular household is one of the quickest ways to spread the virus and hurt our communities – and it doesn’t matter where it is. Weddings, feasts, weekends at the cabin, any time you have more than those then those that live in your household close to you – we all need to avoid this.  We understand this is very difficult time with a lot of change in how we interact. We need to make some tough decisions, and get creative to protect each other, our elders and our most vulnerable.  But we can’t let being separate in space divide us in spirit. This is the time to strengthen our connections with our family, connect with those in your household by playing games, cooking together, building forts, learning how to play and learning how to listen.  For family and friends outside your household, keep connected from afar.  For communities, share your spirit with vehicle parades or teddy bears hunts, open window drum dances or social media sharing, prayer trees or set times everyone does something together in their own space.  Another concern we have is reports from the RCMP about crowded house and apartment parties taking place in communities around the territory.  This is not the time for a party – and if you’re organizing them, you’re bringing unnecessary danger to your community.  If you’re young and healthy, you may not even notice that you have the virus. But you can still spread it to people who can get really sick – your parents, your grandparents, other members of your community that you know and love.  We encourage you to try creative ways to stay close to your friends without being in the same place. Try a group chat, or stay in touch on social media. If you have a good internet connection, Google offers free video conferencing so you can see each other.  I also want to also touch upon our enforcement efforts.  Since setting up the Protect NWT self-isolation planning and compliance line, we have received 85 complaints related to compliance.  We have closed 58 after taking the necessary corrective actions, like warnings and education measures.  10 have been closed due to non-actionable information.  16 investigations are now underway.  We will always aim to educate first, and take additional action only when necessary.  But if we find people aren’t following the orders, nothing is off-the-table in finding ways to increase compliance. I want to remind residents that no one is immune from this virus.  We know from stories around the globe that whether you’re a 25 year-old marathon runner, or a pensioner, this virus can get you.  And even if you don’t get very sick, you can be an unknowing spreader of this virus, and hurt people you care about.   In short, we’re in this together. And it’s important we keep our solidarity as we work to limit the spread.  So stay socially connected, while keeping physically distant.  Help your communities however you can. And be kind to each other.  As long as we’re united, I know we’ll get through this – together. "

While we knew that it was only reasonable to expect more cases would be discovered in the Northwest Territories, this news still comes as a disappointment to many.

""I want to thank our public health officials for all the work they are doing to protect the health of our people and communities.

The last time we were here, when we discussed the roll out of the first wave of financial relief the GNWT put together in response to COVID 19, I said that we would continue to look for opportunities to be creative in the delivery of government services.   I am pleased to be here again with you today to introduce a second wave of financial relief measures our government has identified to keep or put money in the hands of residents and businesses as we all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID 19. First, I would like to talk about some changes to the Income Assistance Program. Minister Simpson and his team have identified a series of immediate changes that will help support some of our most financially vulnerable citizens.  Today, we are introducing a one-time emergency allowance for income assistance recipients that will provide $500 to single recipients, and $1000 to households with two or more people to ensure that they have appropriate cleaning supplies, and are prepared for a 14 day period of self-isolation. We are also be providing additional benefits to Income Assistance clients by excluding ‘gifts and unearned income’ from the calculation of earned income until June 30, 2020. This change will ensure that income assistance clients are able to keep whatever money they are given or earn over the next several months. Next, Minister Chinna and her team at the NWTHC have identified $5 million dollars to support the immediate need to provide housing to people who are homeless or have housing instability so that they can self-isolate. $1.4 million of this funding will support the development of 36 housing units at the Aspen apartments and 25 units at the Arnica Inn; while $3.6 million will be directed to renovating 130 units in communities across the NWT. These units will ensure that individuals have somewhere safe to stay right away if they need to self-isolate and will help to reduce the risk of spreading Covid-19 associated with overcrowded and instable housing. We are also announcing several sector specific initiatives today, including: Health and Social Services is waiving professional fees for medical professionals in the territory; The GNWT will waive interest charges on all late tax returns between March 15 and June 30 including fuel tax and payroll tax; and In support of our restaurant and hospitality industry, the NWTLCC will offer to buy back any unopened alcohol stock, ensuring that businesses have access to the cash they need now. Together with the initiatives being announced by Minister Nokleby, this second wave of financial relief in response to the COVID 19 pandemic is the next step in our work to support northerners and is valued at approximately $8.259 million. These initiatives are to be implemented immediately.   This adds to the initial financial responses announced earlier this month for a combined total value of approximately $21.459 million in GNWT financial relief to COVID-19. As I said the last time, we will continue our work to support the people, businesses and communities of the Northwest Territories.  Our Premier and every Cabinet Minister have regular calls with our Federal, Provincial and Territorial counterparts where we share ideas and initiatives that we are undertaking here in the NWT, as well as thoughts and ideas on how to make the Federal programs as effective as possible for each region’s particular challenges; including, for example, the funding provided to Indigenous governments to support on the land activities. There is no doubt that we will need to continue to work closely with our Federal colleagues as we analyze and ultimately respond to the full financial impacts of COVID in the coming weeks and months.  We will also continue our financial response efforts at home. Several departments are already looking at what areas will require legislative or regulatory change in order to provide further relief for challenges created by the pandemic response. The Department of Finance continues to work with all departments to identify any areas where cost relief can be offered or existing financial supports made more flexible. Our unwavering goal is first and foremost to ensure the physical health of the people of the NWT by limiting the spread of COVID 19 but then also to ensure the mental, social and financial wellbeing of the NWT. We all remain committed to a whole of government response that will achieve these goals. "

Examples such as utilizing northern companies to ensure the supply chain remains intact or to provide Personal Protective equipment, services for decontamination, or safety training.  We are also looking at ways to utilize key infrastructure projects to ensure the construction and consulting sectors are sustained, and that projects critical to our territory, such as long term care facilities, continue to advance. Departments have been working extremely hard to make sure that project execution remains a focus, while also doing their part to ensure that the precautionary health measures put in place to protect the spread of COVID-19 across our territory are adhered to. As the Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment, it is part of my job to safeguard our economy, and I want to reassure each resident that I am focused during this time on ensuring minimal impacts to the economy.  I know residents are worried and I continue to hear concerns from people who have lost business revenue, or employment because of COVID-19.  Concerns over mine closures are another big discussion right now. Our mines and other resource project operators, like all Northwest Territories’ business, are making tough decisions in the interest of the health and wellbeing of their employees, clients, and residents of the NWT. They are also being forced to make difficult decisions about their futures.  All major resource projects are different: in their ownership structures, their operations, and their workforces. These differences directly affect how they go about implementing COVID-19 response plans.  We are supportive of the mines and operations that are prepared to operate safely as long as they can. I can assure the public that the mines are working directly with the Worker’s Safety and Compensation Commission and the Chief Public Health Office to identify a way for them to continue to operate that protects the safety of our residents. We’re going to see economic impacts of Covid-19 over a range of sectors, but how we react, and the proactive measures we put in place as we face these challenges, will ultimately determine how we are impacted by them.   The supports announced today will help, but are only part of the equation.   In the days and weeks that follow, the GNWT will continue to find other ways to support our residents and communities.  We will also continue to work with the Government of Canada and our federal ministerial counterparts to draw their attention to the unique needs of the north and northern businesses. Over the last several weeks I, and my colleagues, have participated in numerous national level calls where we continue to be a strong voice, ensuring that federal relief and recovery programs are relevant and applicable to our unique northern environment.  Together, we will get through this and demonstrate to the world that strong northern resiliency that will help us to come out of this time even stronger. Thank you.   "

The Northwest Territories Association of Communities (NWTAC), Music NWT, and the GNWT have teamed up to run these campaigns. Our goal is to build solidarity during the COVID-19 crisis, and get residents to recognize that changing behaviors isn’t just about them – it’s about the people they love, and our most vulnerable community-members. Protect Our Elders: A Community Campaign To Stop The Spread Of COVID-19 This social media campaign encourages NWT residents to share the message that the kindest thing we can do to protect our Elders, and keep our loved ones safe, is to stay home and keep at least 2 meters away from people outside our homes. Community members are encouraged to snap a selfie and submit it (& share it on your social media!) for your messages to be shared along with those of other northerners. Together, we can send a message loud and clear to everyone in the NWT that NOW is the time to be physically apart, so that we can come together with our Elders in good health again soon. Protect Our Elders: Radio Ad Writing Competition This campaign invites you to record your own radio ad that encourages everyone to protect our elders and loved ones by keeping two metres apart, practice good hygiene, and do their part by self-isolating as much as possible. It can be a song, a story, a touching PSA – the door is wide open and thinking outside the box is encouraged. And don’t think you need a professional recording rig – recording on your phone is good enough. Music NWT is offering cash prizes for the top entries, as well as an honourable mention for ads that really hit home. The winning ads will be played on NWT radio! Quick Facts While anyone can catch it, elders, those who have compromised immune systems, and those who have had diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart or lung disease are most at-risk of catching, and getting very sick from COVID-19.

This appointment has been made to support the ongoing work of the department and in particular the operations of the Emergency Management Organization as it leads activities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) has activated the existing emergency management structures, and have quickly introduced some of the most aggressive measures in response. During this emergency, Minister Chinna will be served by two deputies within MACA, with the new Associate Deputy Minister having primary responsibility for ensuring that the Emergency Management Organization within the Department has the required support. Mr. Neudorf will be working closely with all deputies, as we collectively address this emergency. Mr. Neudorf has previously served in the GNWT as a Deputy Minister of the Department of Transportation, and as an Associate Deputy Minister responsible for special projects subsequent to the amalgamation of the Departments of Transportation and Public Works and Services. In addition to the appointment of Mr. Neudorf as an Associate Deputy Minister for a term of 6 months, additional policy support for the Emergency Management Organization is being provided through departmental redeployments as MACA continues to respond to this emergency.

Take This Online Self-Assessment For COVID-19 In The Northwest Territories,"The GNWT’s online self-assessment tool for COVID-19 for residents has been completed nearly 2500 times after launching just days ago. The tool will help assess any symptoms, travel history, and other variables to help you know what you should do to protect yourself and your community. You can complete it for yourself, or you can complete it for someone else. The tool collects no personal information. Based on the outcome, the assessment tool will give residents information on what they should do next. The tool will let you know if you should be contacting a local health care centre by phone to arrange testing, or if symptoms are severe enough that you should call for emergency help. The objectives of providing this tool are two-fold: Give residents peace of mind and clear direction based on their situation, and Reduce strain on call-in operations and frontline health workers to better serve people across the Northwest Territories. All residents who can use this tool, or can get help using it, are urged to use the self-assessment tool to help us reach these objectives. Printed versions of the self-assessment are being distributed to health care centres. Anyone using a self-assessment tool should be aware of what assessment tool they are using. There are many online self-assessment tools available from the federal government and other provinces which do not reflect the Northwest Territories’ aggressive testing strategy. To get the appropriate information and guidance within the NWT, residents are encouraged to only use the NWT’s online-self assessment tool. If a person is experiencing severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, call 9-1-1 and do not proceed with the self-assessment tool.    "

This week, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs Paulie Chinna exercised her authority under the Emergency Management Act and declared a state of emergency for the Northwest Territories.  I want to emphasize and reassure NWT residents that this step was not taken because the risk of COVID-19 to the NWT has increased or that the situation is worse than before. It is not.  The Northwest Territories still has only one confirmed case of COVID-19 and our government has taken swift action to restrict travel into the NWT and set up self-isolation facilities for returning NWT residents in regional centres.  The main reason for this decision was to make sure that the Emergency Management Organization – or EMO – has all the tools it needs to implement the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.  This declaration is all about making sure that our officials who are working night and day to support the Chief Public Health Officer and slow the spread of COVID-19 have all the resources and authority they need to do their jobs.  Last week, when Minister Thom, Dr. Kandola, and I spoke to media about the NWT’s first and only confirmed case of COVID-19, we promised to take strong action to protect the people of the Northwest Territories. That is what this decision is – strong action.  I have spoken at length with Minister Chinna about this decision. She is working remotely from her home in Norman Wells and was unable to join us for this news conference, but will be available to media this afternoon.  I want to let people know that the Minister has not taken this step lightly. She has given a lot of thought to the needs of the entire territory and she wants to make sure that she has done everything in her power to help the Chief Public Health Officer and our staff slow the spread of COVID-19.  In closing, I want to assure the people of the Northwest Territories that their government is putting everything it has into slowing the spread of COVID-19 and reducing its impact on our communities.  All Ministers and Departments are committed to this fight and we are working day and night to protect our people and our communities, along with our community and Indigenous government partners, and our partners in the federal and provincial governments.  We know we face challenges, but Northerners are tough, resilient people and I am confident that we can meet that challenge together.  By all of us working together, we will be able to address this pandemic.  Once again, I would like to remind the public to follow the health and safety precautions:  Wash your hands frequently;  Keep your physical distance from people to 2 metres;  Stay home as much as possible, especially if you’re sick;  Follow the procedures outlined on the Health and Social Services website if you are unwell and have flu-like symptoms;  And don’t forget to keeping talking to your friends and neighbours via social media or calling.  Together, we will get through this.  I would now like to turn it over to EMO Director Ivan Russell to explain some of the details of this declaration. "

This step has been taken to ensure the Emergency Management Organization (EMO) is better able to support the implementation of the orders issued by the Chief Public Health Officer to help slow the spread of COVID-19, and gives the EMO the authority to control and direct all persons, including the GNWT and public agencies involved in emergency management plans or programs under the Emergency Management Act.    At this time, all residents are urged to follow these Orders and all other direction and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer.   The State of Emergency will be in effect from March 24 through April 7, 2020. Quotes “It is really important that the Government of the Northwest Territories does everything it can to support our Chief Public Health Officer. This Order will give us additional authorities to help Dr. Kandola and make sure she is able to do everything she can to protect NWT residents.  Now is a time for us to move forward, calmly and steadily. It is a time for all Northerners to join together and support each other. Follow the advice and directions of health officials and emergency responders. Let’s be kind to one another and, as we have done so many times before, let us come together as a community to face this challenge together.” Paulie Chinna, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs “I want to assure the people of the Northwest Territories that all levels of Government are taking this pandemic very seriously, and doing what we can to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Declaring a state of emergency, as many other jurisdictions have, will help ensure that our officials have all the tools they need to do their jobs to protect and care for residents. We will continue to work closely with the Federal government, provinces and territories to ensure coordinated approaches to the pandemic.” Caroline Cochrane, Premier Quick Facts The State of Emergency was declared on the recommendation of the head of the Emergency Management Organization, Ivan Russell. Declaring a State of Emergency provides additional powers to the Minister and those designated by the Minister to do all acts and take all necessary proceedings, for the duration of the order, to deal with an emergency. Steps already taken by the GNWT to support the implementation of the public health order include establishing isolation centres and putting measures in place to receive travellers at airports in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River and Fort Smith, and at ground entry points to secure borders in Enterprise, Fort Smith, Liard and Dempster entry points.

Simpson met with Northwest Territories (NWT) Education Leaders and the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) via teleconference on Tuesday, March 24 to discuss the status of JK-12 education in the territory as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency. Education Leaders included Chairs of the Tłı̨chǫ Community Services Agency, Dettah and Ndilo District Education Authorities (DEAs), the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, Beaufort Delta Education Council, Dehcho Divisional Education Council, South Slave Divisional Education Council, Sahtu Divisional Education Council, Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic Schools, as well as NWTTA President. Due to the significant health concerns posed by COVID-19 and the importance of following direction from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) on social distancing as a way to keep students, staff and communities safe, Education Leaders have agreed with the recommendation from Minister Simpson that schools be closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. Education Leaders have shared the recommendation with District Education Authorities, who hold the authority under the Education Act to close NWT schools. Closures are being announced individually by respective education councils. Minister Simpson, Education Leaders and the NWTTA recognize the serious impact school closures will have on students, parents, staff and communities, and have agreed that a plan is required to support continued learning for all students, especially those in Grade 12, to achieve their education and career goals.  ECE continues to meet daily with NWT education superintendents and the NWTTA to discuss support for essential services, continuity of educational programming and ongoing communication. These plans continue to be adjusted as new information and direction is provided by the CPHO. While the immediate priority is not to provide lessons or give instruction it is necessary to identify and secure essential services for supporting students and communities. All parties share the strong interest of parents and communities in ensuring opportunities for continued learning. The NWTTA has advised that teachers are prepared and willing to help students and communities however they can during this unprecedented time. ECE will continue to work with the NWTTA and education bodies to find options for providing educational programming to all NWT students, particularly those in Grade 12. This includes reviewing what’s being done in other jurisdictions, especially Alberta,  whose curriculum and major assessment tools are used for the majority of NWT education programming. ECE will also be working to coordinate with post-secondary institutions across Canada in an effort to ensure the smoothest transition possible for those graduating this year. Minister Simpson continues to have weekly calls with Canadian Education Ministers to discuss ways to ensure students graduating high school this year are able to advance to post-secondary institutions. The continuation of meal programs, along with counselling and other health and wellness programming, have been identified by ECE, the CPHO and education bodies as essential to NWT communities, and work is ongoing to identify which positions and individuals will be involved in providing these programs and services during school closures.  ECE will continue to provide updates to parents, communities and education bodies as plans are developed and implemented.    Quote: “The COVID-19 situation in the Northwest Territories has evolved substantially since the initial closure of schools on March 16. As new public health advisories and orders are put in place, including the declaration of a public health emergency, the closure of the NWT border and the cancellation of all gatherings, we must continue to make difficult decisions to protect the health and safety of our residents. I am grateful to the NWT Education Leaders for their dedication and commitment to ensuring the well-being of our students, staff and communities in deciding to close schools for the remainder of the school year. As Minister, I remain committed to working with our education bodies to provide students and communities with the programs and services they need to succeed throughout this unprecedented time.”  - Hon. R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment  						Quick Facts: The Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) of the NWT made the recommendation that schools remain closed until after Easter Break as a precautionary measure to minimize the potential spread of COVID-19.  On March 21, the CPHO issued an order to close the border and require all NWT residents returning from outside the territory to self-isolate for 14 days. This current order from the CPHO applies to all school staff and students returning from travel. A significant number of school employees were out of the territory on spring break when these travel restrictions were ordered, and are therefore currently self-isolating. ECE and education bodies continue to work together on continuity planning in relation to JK-12 class cancellation. All options for continued provision of educational services, including potential alternative learning plans, are currently being explored.   Links: COVID-19 Information (HSS) Information on JK-12 Schools (ECE) 							  							Media Inquiries: 							Press Secretary  							Cabinet Communications 							Government of the Northwest Territories 							Email:  presssecretary@gov.nt.ca "

Today, our territory confirmed its first case of COVID-19.  First of all, I’d like to echo Premier Cochrane’s message of support to those affected.  These things are hard — for the individuals who contract the virus, for friends, for families, and for our communities.  Our thoughts are with you. And so too are our actions.  And to that end, NWT Chief Public Health Officer Dr. KamI Kandola has issued an order prohibiting entry of non-residents to the Northwest Territories by land, air, or port with limited exceptions, and requiring by order that all returning residents must self-isolate in Yellowknife, Fort Smith, Hay River, or Inuvik.  These measures are drastic. They will be challenging. But they are necessary.  This government is dedicating all available resources to pushing back the spread of this virus.  We’re testing at a rate double that of Canada’s as-a-whole so we can trace and respond to infection quickly.  We’re marshalling all available resources to bolster our healthcare response.  And no option is off-the-table as we move forward. I want to send a strong message to communities across the Northwest Territories today.  The threat COVID-19 poses to our territory is real.  And the challenges we now face are significant. We must strictly follow the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer as she works to respond to this crisis.  And if you don’t, you are hurting our communities, and hampering our response.  We’re all in this together. It is on all of us to do our part. And I have confidence today, with the leadership and expertise of Dr. Kandola, and the strength of our communities, that we can band together, help each other, and change our lifestyles to combat COVID-19.  I will now pass it off to Dr. Kami Kandola to provide more details. "

Late last night our public health officials confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories.    This is hard news to share and I want to express my concern and sympathy for the people affected by this and let them know that the Government of the Northwest Territories is going to do everything we can to support them in this difficult time.    To the people of the Northwest Territories, I want to say that we knew this day would come and the GNWT has been working hard so that we would be prepared when it did.    We know there are simple and effective steps that we can all take to help slow down and limit the spread of this virus in our communities.    Slowing the spread will give our medical officials like Dr. Kandola the time they need to keep planning and managing our response so we can help protect residents and communities.    Slowing the spread will also ensure our health care system is not flooded with a large wave of sick people all at once. This will be crucial to maintaining our capacity to care for and treat the people who do get sick.    This is why the Government of the Northwest Territories began its own preparations weeks before a pandemic was declared, and this has enabled us to take the right measures to respond to COVID-19.    We have taken strong actions to prepare already and we are going to continue to take strong action to protect all our residents.    This confirmed case is being investigated thoroughly. We are in the process tracing contacts and doing everything in our capacity to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the NWT.  We want to reassure the public that we are taking all appropriate measures to keep the residents and communities of the NWT safe. Efforts that began weeks ago will continue as we move forward with these challenges.  I commend the healthcare providers and front line service staff across the NWT for their commitment and dedication to keeping residents of the NWT safe.   I also want to thank the many businesses who have stepped up to help keep our supply chains flowing such as grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations.  I want to thank those who have helped to ensure food is being delivered to our elderly and homeless and who have gone out of their way to help others in our communities.  I also want to remind everyone that we need to work together if we are going to combat this.  The best chance we have to make a difference is to follow the advice of the Chief Public Health officer.   If you are sick, stay home. Continue to practice social distancing and wash your hands.   By all of us working together, we will make a difference in how COVID-19 impacts our own families, our neighbours and all residents of the NWT.  I will now hand this over to the Minister of Health, Diane Thom."

811,2020-03-20,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/northwest-territories-covid-19-economic-relief,Government Website,Northwest Territories COVID-19 Economic Relief,"The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT)  recognizes the difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic and health measures being taken to combat the virus’ spread is causing NWT businesses, service providers, residents, governments and non-government organizations. Today, Minister Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance and Minister Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment, and Infrastructure, announced Economic Relief Measures that will help minimize expenses and keep cash available for immediate needs in this time of uncertainty. The GNWT has put together an initial economic relief package valued at $13.2 Million dollars that will take effect immediately. This package is intended to work in concert with federal incentives under Canada’s $27 billion COVID-19 Economic Response Plan announced earlier this week.  In addition to this first wave of economic relief announced today by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Industry Tourism and Investment and Infrastructure, the GNWT will continue to identify other relief measures to assist territorial residents and business owners and operators as we respond toCOVID-19. Quotes “The GNWT has been able to identify immediate steps we can take to waive fees, ease funding restrictions, and defer payments in order to reduce economic stress on territorial residents and businesses. This is not a time for anyone to worry about bills or payments. Right now we want to ensure that business who provide public services can do so safely and that employees who can stay home do so without worrying about economics. By working together we stand the best chance of reducing the potential for COVID-19 infections in the NWT.”  - Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance “We recognize that this is a difficult time for business owners and service providers in the Northwest Territories. In the short term, we will provide necessary financing to small businesses to the extent that we can. In the long term, we will work with the business community to identify a path forward to economic recovery.   We are going to need help from the federal government and we will continue to be a voice for Northwest Territories’ business in discussions addressing the costs and challenges that we are experiencing. In the meantime, I urge residents to do what they can to support local business and service providers.” - Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment and Infrastructure Quick Facts Immediate GNWT Response Measures 	Fee Reduction  	Provide relief to northern supply chain businesses through a removal of fees until the end of June for: Deh Cho Bridge tolls Truck permits Airport landing fees BDIC - Working Capital Loans Offer low interest loans to businesses to help offset up to one month of COVID-19 impacts. This will also be available to new BDIC clients.    BDIC - Defer Loan Payments Allow for the deferral of any BDIC loan payments for a period of up to three cumulative months, between April 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, with no penalty or additional interest charges.  Establish Economic Relief and Growth Advisory Group Begin work to establish an Advisory Council to help identify the economic impacts of the pandemic; represent the business community; and ensure that the items most critical to local economies and jobs are targeted for medium and long term government support.

The situation with COVID-19 is evolving quickly, and in times like this, what many people want most are answers. They want to know that their physical, and financial wellbeing are being looked out for. That their governments understand these pressures, and are doing everything they can.  Well, I am here today with Minister Wawzonek to try to ease some of that worry, and reassure you that there are many hardworking, dedicated people working tirelessly to deal with each issue that arises, and protect NWT residents during this uncertain time.   There is no denying that COVID-19 is a significant challenge around the world, and in the Northwest Territories.  In the North, the global situation will have an immense impact on us. There is no avoiding the economic impacts that we are already challenged with, but we are committed to doing what we can to help residents, businesses, and our economy during this period of uncertainty. As Minister Wawzonek has outlined, the GNWT has put together an initial $13.2 Million dollar economic relief package that will take effect immediately. This funding is intended to work in concert with federal incentives announced under Canada’s $27 billion COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, earlier this week. We understand the critical importance of maintaining the northern supply chain. The delivery of essential goods must continue in order to resupply our communities, and support our economy. To help maintain ground-based resupply into the territory, all toll fees for crossing the Deh Cho Bridge and many permit fees for transport trucks on all NWT highways will be waived until June. To support our airlines, all landing fees at all NWT airports will also be waived. At the BDIC, we’re going to offer low interest loans to businesses to help offset COVID-19 impacts, and allow the deferral of any BDIC loan payments for a period of up to three months with no penalty or additional interest charges. As well, we’ll offer an extension of the due date for Employer Assessment Payments with the WSCC from April 1 to May 1, 2020. We will also establish an Economic Council to help identify the economic impacts, represent the business community, and ensure that the items most critical to local economies and jobs are addressed.  There are a number of other items being implemented, and the full list of GNWT response measures for phase 1, are included in the release.   I want to reassure residents and our business community that we will continue to look at ways to support you and continue to assess other relief measures, including leaning on the federal government to offer more support to the North. The Premier and each member of Cabinet will continue to be a voice for our residents and businesses in conversations with our federal counterparts. Addressing the costs, and challenges that we are all experiencing is a priority, and we are committed to keeping you informed along the way.  Before I conclude my statement, I’d like to take a moment to address the concerns about the NWT Diamond Mines, and the decision made by Dominion Diamond Mine to temporarily suspend operations at Ekati, in the interest of mitigating the spread of COVID-19 to the NWT. This is obviously difficult news to take from the perspective of the NWT economy, and the livelihoods of those that are reliant on Ekati for jobs or business.  We know that the impacts of COVID-19 are far reaching and that includes our mining industry. That said, all mines are not equal. Their ownership structure, operations, and their capacity to address issues like COVID-19 is different. The Diavik and Gacho Kué mines, and other businesses, are also taking steps to address the COVID19 crisis. The fact that they are still operating should not be a reflection of a disregard for what is happening. I am confident that businesses that are still in operation are adhering to the safety precautions outlined by the Chief Public Health Officer, and are operating within the parameters that have been put in place so far. I want to reassure businesses and residents who depend on the mines that the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment has been in regular communication with our mines, and advanced projects on COVID-19 contingency planning efforts. The mines and industry have agreed to keep us informed, and I am committed to sharing updates and information on that, and other important matters, as I am able to do so."

Eight days ago the full Assembly came together, took stock of the growing risks of the COVID-19 pandemic and took action by deciding to end our winter session early. This past Monday, all 19 members of the Assembly supported the passage of an interim appropriation to provide a temporary budget for the functioning of the Government of the NWT until we can reconvene at the end of May.  The use of an interim appropriation might was the first step in our financial response to COVID-19. Those initial steps and further items are what I am going to outline briefly today. In these last few days, we have identified several other initiatives that we can take immediately to help support the financial health of our residents and businesses. What we are describing today is only phase 1. This has been a whole-of government effort including FIN, INF, ITI, ECE, MACA, NTPC and the WSCC. We are all working together to identify ways to help put money in the hands of people who need it for groceries,  and businesses who are trying to keep their payroll going.  This spirit of everyone working together applies to the private sector as well. There are many businesses continuing to provide services: plumbers and mechanics, drive through restaurants, grocers, water and sewage trucks, and supply chain transport and logistics. I believe they are all doing their best to follow the advice of the CPHO while also working hard to keep our communities running. I also want to acknowledge efforts from different sectors to at least temporarily reduce or remove fees, including the ongoing ask from NWTel to the CRTC. I want to encourage everyone to keep being creative and thinking of others during these unprecedented events.  With that, I want to describe this first wave of initiatives that provide an equivalent of at least $13.2m worth of financial supports to the NWT in response to COVID-19:  Interim appropriation budget:  HSS extra 25%: we want our health professionals to know, you are there for all of us and we will be supporting you  		615k for dialysis expansion in HR; expansion of regional health services and immediately, that means an injection of 615k to the HSS budget   ECE extra 25%, now set $2m for IA expecting a growth in demand and need; short term is going to be hard, we know that, and we have planned for it  100% almost all dept’s grants and contribution funding ready to go out April 1 		IGs, Community governments and NGOS will have access to their full 12 months worth of funding upfront on April 1   100% of almost all contracting available for departments to commit as of April 1  		Departments can commit to all of our business and community partners relying on the full 12 months worth of funds   Additional initiatives:  We will allow carry overs for all 2019-2020 contributions  		IGs, CG and NGOs with money in their 2019-20 budgets can continue to use those funds for their ongoing operations   advance royalty payments to devolution signatory Indigenous Governments  		Usually the payment is made in July once the previous year’s royalties are fully reported  Advance 50% of the anticipated royalties from 2019-2020 now  IGs can provide their own direct support to their people and communities   NTPC will remove load limiters and pause collections  Similarly, FIN will also be temporarily pausing collections owed to the GNWT such as payroll tax and ECE will defer all Student Financial Assistance payments until September 30  Next steps  Need to continue to support our most vulnerable  No one should worry about food, mortgages, heat or other basic needs  We will make sure that the Federal financial measures are accessible across communities  And we will look at what further supports GNWT can provide while we all navigate the realities of a global pandemic  We also have our eyes on the hopefully not too distant future and what kinds of steps we will need to take once the wave has crested  As I said in my budget speech last month, this government is going to be creative and collaborative in order to find solutions that are responsive and responsible  That has not changed. If anything, this is our opportunity to put those promises into action.  "

The Public Health Emergency was declared upon the recommendation of Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola, and is in effect from March 18 through April 1.  The purpose of calling an emergency is to allow the Chief Public Health Officer to take strong, binding actions to protect all Northwest Territories residents, and swiftly respond to the daily-evolving needs of the healthcare system as it tackles a pandemic.  At this time, Dr. Kandola is focusing efforts on controlling the spread over the next 60 days.

818,2020-03-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/media-statement-premier-cochrane-passing-john-havelock-parker,Government Website,Media Statement: Premier Cochrane on the passing of John Havelock Parker,"Premier Caroline Cochrane issued the following statement on the passing of former Commissioner John Havelock Parker: I am sad to learn of the passing of John Parker this past Monday, March 9. Mr. Parker moved north in 1954 to work in mining, eventually becoming manager of Rayrock Mine, and then President of Precambrian Mining Services Ltd. In 1959, he was elected as a Councillor for the Town of Yellowknife, serving for five years, before successfully running as Mayor of Yellowknife in 1964. In 1967, Mr. Parker was appointed to the Northwest Territories Council, and sat as Deputy Commissioner. With Commissioner Stuart Hodgson, he helped to bring the seat of the Government of the Northwest Territories from Ottawa to the new capital of Yellowknife, to be closer to the people it serves. In those days, the Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner held cabinet portfolios with their colleagues on the Executive Council. When appointed as Commissioner in 1979, Mr. Parker led the transition of the role of Commissioner from actively sitting in the Legislative Assembly and chairing Cabinet meetings, to its current role as the representative of the Crown and appointed by Canada, functioning similar to a lieutenant governor. In 1986, Mr. Parker was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for his significant contributions to the evolution and development of the territorial government and the municipal government of Yellowknife. Under Mr. Parker’s leadership, our system of government grew more responsible and representative of its people, for which we are exceedingly grateful. On behalf of all residents of the Northwest Territories, I offer my condolences to Mr. Parker’s family and friends in this difficult time."
819,2020-03-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-covid-19-update,Government Website,Diane Thom: COVID-19 Update,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide Members and the public with an update on NWT efforts in containing the spread of COVID-19 and assure everyone that their health and safety is the number one priority of our government. Currently, we have zero confirmed cases in the Northwest Territories. Our Chief Public Health Officer remains confident our residents are currently at a low risk of infection.  We also know that world-wide, roughly 80 percent of people infected get only mild symptoms.  We are working very hard to slow the spread of infection and know that everyone has a stake in doing their part.  We have been promoting good respiratory practices.  This means that you and your family members should stay home if you are sick and keep your distance from Elders and people who may have underlying conditions that make them vulnerable to infection. Wash your hands frequently, turn and cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing with your elbow, and making sure we are two metres apart in all social situations.  In this way we can slow the spread together.  Mr. Speaker, the Chief Public Health Officer is leading our public health response planning while the GNWT Territorial Planning Committee is leading the broader, all-of-government emergency response planning.   Our health system’s Emergency Operations Centre has been activated.  This allows us to coordinate rapid COVID-19 system planning and preparation.   A NWT COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Guide and Checklist is guiding our system preparations. We currently have a sufficient stockpile of personal protective equipment for frontline workers and will continue to track this.  Community Health Centre and hospitals are completing their planning and preparation and testing kits are in every community.   Mr. Speaker, NWT health professionals are testing residents and visitors for COVID-19 who present flu-like symptoms that have travelled outside of the NWT recently, regardless of where they have travelled.  This action permits us to take prompt action should a positive COVID-19 case be confirmed.  We began this enhanced testing well before Coronavirus was declared a pandemic and this is helping us. The Chief Public Health Officer issues regular public health alerts to frontline health professionals.  These alerts reinforce the need for heightened awareness and the use of best practices for communicable disease control at the local level.  Frontline staff and management are also ensuring protections and protocols are in place for workers and others within health facilities to reduce the spread of the virus in those settings. The Chief Public Health Officer has communicated to all NWT schools and daycares, advising on travel outside the NWT, planned international travel, and general advice to prevent infection. These letters were sent to parents and caregivers and are being updated.  Long-term care facilities have been provided information on precautions, protections, and protocols from the Chief Public Health Officer via our Health Authorities to all health care facilities and healthcare professionals; this advice includes following usual flu season-visitors’ hand-washing protocols and staying away if sick.   The Chief Public Health Officer is also assessing all mass gatherings to determine if they should proceed.  Most large indoor events have been cancelled and non-essential travel and attendance at conferences by GNWT employees has been suspended. Over the weekend, the Chief Public Health Officer issued new advice to our residents in keeping with the latest guidance from the Federal government.  We are strongly advising all travellers who have arrived or are arriving from international destinations to now self-isolate for 14 days.  These measures are necessary to combat the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. Mr. Speaker, I know there is a lot of uncertainty and anxiety among us all.  There is no denying that COVID-19 is a significant challenge around the world and in the NWT.  But it is important to remember that by following advice and working together we can to manage this together.   The Chief Public Health Officer and the Department are committed to providing residents with up to date information and will advise the public when confirmed cases have been identified in the NWT.  They are using every available means to communicate with residents in all official languages to provide the most current information so you know what is going on and what you need to do.  Mr. Speaker, Northerners are known for their strength, resiliency and strong sense of family and community.  I know that it is those qualities that we can draw on to keep our communities and our territory healthy.  Staying informed, following the advice provided by our health officials will help us all manage this unprecedented situation together. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak directly to all of our health care workers across our system.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication in making sure we are in the best place possible to respond to COVID-19.  I recognize that there are many challenges ahead and know that you will continue to serve our residents, as you always have, with professionalism, compassion and commitment.

820,2020-03-16,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-covid-19-preparedness,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: COVID-19 Preparedness,"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the members of this Assembly for taking the step of suspending its current sitting after today to allow Cabinet and the public service greater opportunity to prepare for the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  Although there remains no reported case in the NWT, our government continues to prepare for the impact of this pandemic.  Hour to hour, we are monitoring the state of the COVID-19 situation as it continues to evolve. I want to share with the Assembly some of the actions and planning that is underway.  Our health system has been preparing over the last few months, as the concern over this new virus became known. This planning has included securing additional supplies and preparing staff and facilities to respond to an outbreak.  Our health officials have also been working with partners - including the Government of Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada – to stay current with the most recent information and recommendations about this disease.   Based on these discussions, our Chief Public Health Officer has been working tirelessly with her colleagues to provide the best available advice to officials and the public about how to identify and care for those infected and prevent the spread of this disease. One thing we know is that we can slow the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact on our communities if everyone follows the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer, and takes the necessary precautions to protect themselves and most importantly to safeguard those who may be more vulnerable including our elders.  We are fortunate that our health system has not yet had to face any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the NWT, but we know that this virus is spreading and we all need to take personal steps to slow the spread of this illness. By slowing the rate of infection, our health system will be better able to effectively respond to this pandemic.    On Friday, our Health and Social Services Minister thanked our many health care professionals for their dedication and service, and Mr. Speaker on behalf of all of us here in this assembly, and on behalf of the people of the Northwest Territories, I want to also thank them for their efforts to look after us all. We know their work will become more challenging as the COVID-19 virus continues to spread.    Over the weekend, we have also taken the extraordinary step of asking our health care professionals to avoid any unnecessary travel outside of the NWT. This will prevent exposure and help avoid the potential requirements for isolation and will ensure that the NWT health system can maintain as much operational readiness as possible to manage the spread of this disease. Mr. Speaker, work to prepare for a COVID-19 pandemic in the Northwest Territories began even before the World Health Organization declared one. In addition to the measures our health system has put in place to identify, prevent and control the spread of infectious disease, our Government also has dedicated resources and procedures to manage emergencies.  Our Department of Municipal and Community Affairs includes the Emergency Management Organization established under the Emergency Management Act. Its role is, in part, to lead the Government of the Northwest Territories in the coordination of emergency management activities, support emergency management activities of local authorities, and coordinate and assist in the response of governments and public agencies.  The head of the Emergency Management Office also chairs the Territorial Planning Committee that works with community governments and other key partners to ensure readiness, and to respond to emergencies.   Again, although we have yet to face a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the NWT, we have taken the proactive step of activating an Emergency Operations Centre under MACA’s leadership as of March 13, 2020 and work will continue to assist all communities in the NWT to help prevent or manage any COVID-19 outbreak. Mr. Speaker, later this week I will also be convening a virtual meeting with community governments and Indigenous governments to share the latest information we have on our readiness and our plans. We will continue to meet regularly with them to work together to eliminate any gaps in our plans and support our efforts.   We know that many communities and jurisdictions in Canada and throughout the world have made the decision to temporarily close schools as result of this pandemic. The Minister of Education, Culture and Employment has consulted with the Chief Public Health Officer on this, and has received the advice today to close NWT schools until after Easter. Later today, the Minister will be convening a teleconference with all District Education Authorities to discuss this direction and how best to support school teachers, staff and students as they return from Spring Break travel. Mr. Speaker, as we prepare for this pandemic, the health and safety of our people is paramount. Every GNWT department and agency has been tasked with identifying and planning for the continuation of essential services. If a large number of our employees are required to self-isolate to prevent the further spread of the virus, we know that government services may face a significant disruption. It is critical that key services remain supported, and we are taking the proper steps to deal with a scenario where we have dramatically fewer available employees. All departments and agencies have been updating their Business Continuity Plans and later this week these plans will be finalized, and validated with table top exercises to ensure potential gaps have been identified and can be addressed. We know that the work of our government touches upon the lives of the people we serve in important ways, and that we need to make sure that there is as little disruption as possible should we find that many of our employees have to be isolated to care for themselves or others. Our planning will also consider how best to manage the NWT supply chain to help ensure that residents and businesses continue to receive essential services.  Mr. Speaker, it is important to state again that the NWT has no reported cases of COVID-19 and that the risk of contracting the disease in the NWT remains low today.  This does not mean that we can rest easy. We must be prepared to take preventative actions now.  In recent days, we have seen many jurisdictions implement new measures in response to having the virus already spreading within their borders. We have the ability to take measures sooner than others to better manage the risk. This will mean some disruption in travel for residents coming home who will need to self-isolate, and tourists who will have to postpone their visits the NWT. It is critically important that all residents of, and visitors to, the NWT take precautions and follow the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer. As our preparations continue it is also critical that our community partners work with MACA’s Emergency Operations Centre to ensure plans are in place, and that every effort is made to minimize the risk and manage the impacts of this pandemic.   We are implementing the best approaches available to slow and manage the spread of COVID-19. While we must not panic, we do have to take precautions.  I want to thank all residents of the Northwest Territories for their understanding as we direct more of the work of our government to managing this issue, and acknowledge that some of this effort will necessarily come at the expense of other priorities. However, protecting our most vulnerable from this pandemic is our most important priority, and we are working closely with our service providers to develop plans. Mr. Speaker, we know that the consequences of this pandemic are already having an impact on our economy, and that many of our residents and businesses will need support. These concerns have been raised with the Prime Minister, and I am very encouraged that there is clearly recognition that new federal programs and investments will be required to protect our economy. Additional options to provide support to our residents and businesses are being actively considered.    Information on the spread of this new virus and knowledge of how best to manage its impacts has been changing rapidly. That is why we are working closely with our partners from across all jurisdictions to stay up to date on the latest information. We will be providing daily reports and have set up a single portal for more information at www.gov.nt.ca and click on the corona virus feature box. The website is being updated as new information becomes available.  We recognize that people are concerned, but I want to remind everbody that we can all take practical steps to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. We will continue to update our residents, our communities, and Indigenous government partners, and I strongly urge everybody to check our website frequently and heed the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer and our Emergency Management Office as we work together to safeguard our friends, families and our elders. Mahsi, Mr. Speaker."

There are currently no cases of COVID-19 in the NWT, and the risk of acquiring the virus in the NWT and Canada remains low at this time.  Below is an at-a-glance update on the situation in the NWT as it currently stands. The GNWT is committed to providing updates in a consistent and timely manner and will be providing daily updates to media via email and will implement a weekly media briefing. The Health and Social Services website will also continue to be updated regularly and remains your best source for accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19.    At-a-Glance Update:  Health:  The GNWT recognizes that our health system faces unique Northern challenges in these types of emergency situations, and as a result have been in an active state of readiness for weeks - making the necessary preparations to address the anticipated surge in the number of NWT residents needing to receive health services in the coming weeks and months because of COVID-19. The NWT Chief Public Health Officer increased NWT surveillance to include testing anyone (residents and visitors) who arrives from outside of the NWT and show flu or cold like symptoms within 14 days of their arrival to test for COVID-19.  Having this enhanced surveillance allows for the identification and management of any cases early, thereby reducing the strain on our health care system. Health care providers are on alert to identify and manage possible cases in the NWT, as well as share healthy respiratory practices on an ongoing basis.  Ensuring the continuity of critical government services and programs during a territorial emergency is the responsibility of each GNWT department. Departments have been proactively identifying which services are critical, and putting plans to support their continuation if impacted as this situation evolves. Emergency Measures  The Emergency Management Office (EMO) coordinates the GNWT response in emergencies and is monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely to identify emergency preparedness needs of communities and potential impacts to communities and critical infrastructure. The EMO has been activated to coordinate a broader emergency response. A communications working group has been established to support this group to ensure the public has timely and accurate information.   Residents may notice enhanced signage and prominence of hand hygiene stations at our health facilities. This is for the safety of residents, staff, and patients. Visitors to facilities may be asked screening questions to ensure we are protecting patients at acute care sites and residents at long term care facilities. Residents who are currently experiencing illness or who meet the criteria for self-isolation must call for advice regarding treatment options before presenting to a facility. For more information visit the Health and Social Services website.  Education  Education, Culture and Employment has met with education bodies who are prepared to put their contingency plans in place for school closures should the Chief Public Health Officer direct this action.  Tourism  Industry, Tourism and Investment is working with NWT Tourism to communicate with licenced tourism operators across the NWT, and have provided information about COVID-19 from the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer to them – and to their guests.  Human Resources  As one of the NWT’s largest employers, the GNWT is committed to supporting our employees and their families as we are all faced with this ever-changing situation.  Regardless of their current leave balances, all employees will be able to access sick and/or special leave to deal with the impacts of COVID-19 on their families, if required. All duty and work related travel outside of the territory for GNWT employees has been cancelled or suspended. Employees can make use of our Employee Family Assistance Program, as required.  This situation is evolving quickly. The GNWT is confident it is taking all the necessary preparedness steps to ensure the health and safety of NWT residents, and will continue to provide updates.    For all media requests related to COVID-19, please contact:  Trista Haugland Media and Communications Coordinator, Cabinet Communications  Government of the Northwest Territories  Ph: (867) 767-9140 ext. 11092  Email: Trista_Haugland@gov.nt.ca "

We’ve been making necessary preparations to address a surge in the number of NWT residents needing to receive health services in the coming weeks and months because of COVID-19. We have also been carrying out comprehensive public health surveillance measures, at times going above and beyond what was being recommended by the federal government. This is because we know our best defence in managing the COVID-19 situation is in doing all we can to reduce the likelihood of having it transmitted in our communities. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the dedication and professionalism of the frontline and support staff of the health and social services system. I know staff are strongly committed to ensuring the health of NWT residents. And I know we’ll soon be entering a time when, over coming weeks and months, we will need to call upon staff to continue to support the health system and the delivery of health services to residents, in ways that will require new levels of sacrifice when it comes to work-life balance and spending time with family and friends. I want to reassure residents that the risk of getting COVID-19 in the NWT is low at this time.

The particular vulnerabilities of the Northwest Territories, and indeed all three territories, related to rates of overcrowding, limited health infrastructure and services in small and remote communities were emphasized on this phone call and recognized by our Prime Minister as an area in need of support. Right now we have zero diagnosed cases in the Northwest Territories, but it’s not a matter of if it hits, but when it hits. When it hits, we are emphasizing to Ottawa that we will have special need of support.

Simpson: Rendez-vous de la Francophonie,"Monsieur le President, I am proud to celebrate the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories during the 22nd Annual Rendez-vous de la Francophonie. This nationwide initiative, held every March, is an opportunity for Canada’s 9.5 million French-speakers to promote the French language, and celebrate the many ways it is expressed throughout the country. The Rendez-vous encourages us to celebrate the strength in our diversity and cooperatively address the challenges we face as a territory. This year’s theme of au centre d’un changement is especially relevant as we begin the work to achieve the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly. It is a welcome reminder to embrace a spirit of unity aimed at improving the quality of life for all of our residents. Monsieur le President, this government is committed to providing our French-speaking residents with quality public services and communications. That is why we launched our first annual Francophone Community Satisfaction Survey earlier this month. The survey, available on the Department of Education, Culture and Employment’s website until March 31, 2020, will help us to determine the Francophone community’s level of awareness of the Government of the Northwest Territories' French language communications and how satisfied they are with those services.  We are partnering with Francophone organizations in areas like immigration. During Francophone Immigration Week in 2019, the Government of the Northwest Territories launched the Welcome to the NWT resource book for newcomers at an event hosted by the Northwest Territories’ Francophone immigration network. This guide was designed to help attract, settle, and ensure the retention of foreign nationals to the Northwest Territories, and connect newcomers with the services and resources they need to settle comfortably into their new home communities. We continue to support and engage with Collège nordique francophone. Collège nordique francophone plays a significant role in ensuring diversity in the postsecondary education system, offering language courses and a variety of postsecondary education diploma programs in cooperation with southern institutions. To support this important work, we recently signed a new, three-year contribution agreement with Collège nordique francophone that will begin in the new fiscal year. Monsieur le President, our diverse French population contributes a cultural richness to our communities, not only through language, but through dance, art, food, film, music, ideas, love for the land, and above all, a passion for interconnectedness and cultural exchange.  I am grateful for the gifts we continue to receive from the members of our vibrant and growing Francophone population. Let us continue to work together to celebrate our diversity and to strengthen the social, cultural and economic landscape of the Northwest Territories. Merci, Mr. Speaker."
827,2020-03-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-arctic-winter-games,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Arctic Winter Games,"Mr. Speaker, today I wish to give well deserved recognition to Team Northwest Territories who were scheduled to compete at the 2020 Arctic Winter Games in Whitehorse, Yukon from March 15 -21.  At the same time as providing this recognition, we, of course, have to acknowledge the profound disappointment at the difficult but necessary decision to cancel the 2020 Arctic Winter Games due to the risk presented by the COVID-19 virus. The decision to cancel the games could not have been an easy one, but ultimately, doing what was in the best interests of the health and safety of all those involved had to be the priority.  Mr. Speaker, it is truly unfortunate that there will be no games. Team NT still deserves our thanks and our recognition. Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide Members with some information about Team NT: At the Territorial Trials, 746 athletes, coaches and chaperones from 23 NWT communities competed for the opportunity to represent the NWT. Of this 344 were female participants and 402 were male participants. The 2020 Arctic Winter Games Team consists of 355 participants including athletes, coaches and mission staff from 20 different communities. In addition, 17 officials from across the NWT were scheduled to be involved. Team NT athletes were set to compete in all 20 sports.  Team NT also included a cultural contingent that was going to celebrate our cultural heritage.  17 NWT Youth Ambassadors, with representation from all regions in the Territory, were also set to go to Whitehorse as volunteers. The NWT Youth Ambassador Program (NWT YAP) has been in operation in the Northwest Territories for 12 years, and offers a guided and structured volunteer experience for NWT youth at major territorial, national and international events. Participants have the opportunity to develop life and job skills as well as to build the confidence necessary to deal with complex life challenges. Mr. Speaker,  everyone who is part of Team NT and the contingent who was going to the Arctic Winter games had worked hard for many months and in some cases years to prepare for these games. Team NT is built with the collaboration of so many people who deserve our thanks: Volunteers, sport organizations, and the tireless efforts of parents. I want to say thank you to everyone for all their efforts in the early morning drives, the long hours of practice, and the lessons in fair play and determination. We know the life lessons that involvement in sports teaches are very valuable. What we hope our young people take away from this difficult lesson is that the reward and pride in accomplishment is in the journey.     Mr. Speaker, I want to advise Members that Team NT will be refunded for their deposits and to keep their uniforms. Unfortunately, due to the scope and magnitude that goes into planning events of this type, postponing the games or holding alternative events is not an option.   To close, I would like to extend my thanks to Mr. Doug Rentmeister, Chef de Mission, Mr. Damon Crossman and Mr. Bill Othmer, Assistant Chef de Missions for Team NT  and all the rest of their mission staff as well as the Sport North Federation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
828,2020-03-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-northwest-territories-policing-priorities,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Northwest Territories Policing Priorities,"Mr. Speaker, as Minister of Justice one of my responsibilities is to set the objectives, priorities and goals of the Territorial Police Service. While the GNWT respects the operational independence of the RCMP, the intention of setting these objectives is to establish a broad strategic direction for the delivery of policing services in the Northwest Territories that incorporates the unique needs of our communities. Through past priority setting exercises the RCMP have been asked to place a focus on increasing public trust in policing services, working with partners to improve responses to vulnerable populations, being innovative in addressing community safety, and ensuring a culturally-informed, safe approach to service provision.  Mr. Speaker, the annual policing priorities have traditionally been set directly by the Minister. To ensure that I consider the diverse perspectives of the many unique communities in the Northwest Territories, and that this process is undertaken with transparency, I have invited the leadership of Indigenous, municipal, and community governments to share their views with me on what is most important to their community when it comes to community policing services.  As leaders in their respective communities, I know they are best positioned to share this perspective with me. Seeking their input reflects Cabinet’s commitment to support and enhance our relationships with community and Indigenous governments, and to promote community self-sufficiency. Their contributions in this regard will be used to guide the development of the 2020-2021 broad strategic direction that I will set for the RCMP. It is my intention going forward to engage in this outreach on an annual basis.  These priorities help lead the RCMP and community leadership to develop annual Policing Priority Action Plans. This collaborative work supports the building of trust between RCMP members and the communities they serve, and formalized the engagement efforts of RCMP Detachment Commanders across the NWT. The action plans are revisited annually and revised as necessary by the community and the RCMP, recognizing the shared responsibilities in addressing service provision. Through this process, communities have a direct role in making their community safer. I applaud the work that the RCMP and community leadership have accomplished together to enhance the quality of life in our communities.  Mr. Speaker, few services have as direct an impact on our citizens as the policing services provided by the RCMP. Although we are very fortunate to be provided a professional service by a national police force, and by a division dedicated to community policing, it is incredibly important that we ensure that service reflects the unique context of our Territory. The ultimate goal we are all working towards together is safe communities where our citizens can thrive. I look forward to hearing and understanding the insights of community leadership in shaping the Ministerial priorities for the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

In 2018-2019, the tourism industry showed record numbers in both of these categories, emphasizing once again that the approach to, and investments in, our Tourism 2020 Strategy are working. In fact, over the last five years have increased the number of visitors to our territory by 42% and boosted spending by 43%. As we look to grow and diversify our territory’s economy, these figures are important to our economic outlook. This growth in tourism means new tourism businesses and new service providers. With growth and diversification comes increased employment in our tourism sector and new revenue for our economy. However Mr. Speaker, the full value of tourism is so much more.   In Inuvik, Alestine’s eatery is a constant flurry of activity. Thanks to a regular and growing client base of summer road-tripping visitors, their business is thriving. What is unsaid, and sometimes unnoticed, is that Alestine’s success as a tourism destination means that Inuvik residents also have a restaurant to enjoy year-round. In Tulita, campgrounds and walking trails have been built to accommodate tourists travelling the Mackenzie and Great Bear Rivers however local residents are also benefitting. Families are walking the groomed paths together, healthy eating workshops are being held in the picnic areas, and sharing circles are taking place in the campground teepee.  In Jean Marie River, local artist and Bed and Breakfast owner Lucy Simon shares the art of moosehair tufting, a traditional skill that she is helping to keep alive thanks to the tourism demand for her product. As Ms. Simon shares her creative process with her guests, she is also teaching her skills to a new generation, preserving and sharing this time-honoured activity that was once passed on to her. In Fort Smith, Northwestern Air Lease has seen a significant increase in their tourism-related bookings over the last four years. As a result, young athletes from the region are now benefiting from the company’s success, thanks to discounted rates for teams and groups travelling to compete at sporting events. In Yellowknife, busses and vans park outside Weaver & Devore to allow tourists to flock inside. While this fourth generation family-run business was established almost exclusively to serve mining camps and fishers, tourists now line the aisles as well; providing benefits and opportunities for yet another generation of staff and their families. Mr. Speaker, while our government supports the tourism sector with investments in destination marketing, industry capacity building, and community readiness, we all play a part in its success.  Our North is known for its spectacular landscapes and adventures; its strong Indigenous cultures and traditions; the midnight sun; and Aurora Borealis. But most of all Mr. Speaker, our North is known for its people, their warm welcoming spirit and our world renowned northern hospitality. With the success of our tourism industry, however, there may be times when influx of visitors to our territory puts a strain on our communities and their resources. More people wanting to visit our territory is the kind if challenge we want to have though, and we will continue to work with communities to develop services and options for visitors across the NWT. Mr. Speaker, in coming weeks, using the #Value of Tourism NWT, NWT residents will have the opportunity to read more about the projects that I have highlighted today.  In doing so, I hope that we will all come to recognize that the value of tourism is much more than just economic.  Yes, tourism continues to be an economic driver across the Northwest Territories, injecting over $200 million dollars into our economy annually, but the value of tourism is also found in the infrastructure and services that we enjoy as residents. It is reflected in the preservation of our traditions and cultures and it is implicit in the wellness of our communities and our families. Tourism highlights for the world what those of us living in the North already know, what a wonderful and magical place it is to live.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker  "

831,2020-03-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/new-student-information-system-benefits-aurora-college-students,Government Website,New student information system benefits Aurora College students,"A significant step in strengthening the foundation of Aurora College was made last week when the College launched a new Student Information System. The new system will improve the quality of students’ educational experience and provide data to inform future decision-making as Aurora College transforms to a polytechnic university.  The new information system, a GNWT investment in Aurora College, collects and provides accurate and accessible data ensuring the College can meet the demands of a modern post-secondary institution both during and after its transformation to a polytechnic university.  Aurora College and the Department of Education, Culture and Employment have worked in close collaboration on the implementation of the new system. While the project had been in the planning stages for several years, its implementation fulfils an important commitment made by the GNWT in the Government Response to the Findings and Recommendations of the Aurora College Foundational Review.  The new system, PowerCampus, allows students to access timely information about their own academic journey, and to personally manage more of their interactions with Aurora College. PowerCampus collects a great deal of information and benefits students including providing them with the online ability to:  Apply for Aurora College programs  Select their classes Check their marks Pay their tuition Pay their rent; and View their schedule  The report generation function of the system will provide staff and faculty with information throughout the various stages of the student lifecycle, to inform timely decision-making which, in turn, will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the College and improve the student experience.                                                                                                 In addition to these benefits, PowerCampus will allow Aurora College to more effectively communicate with current and prospective students, as well as alumni and former students.    Quote “Good decisions are based on good data and the new student information system will provide us with the quality data about Aurora College programs and students we need to support student success and to inform our decisions about the future of the College as we continue our planning for the future. The launch of this system is the completion of a GNWT commitment and is a key milestone in Aurora College’s transformation into a polytechnic university.” – R. J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment   Quick Facts Ellucian PowerCampus is a student information system that is used by post-secondary institutions across the globe. The cost of purchasing and implementing PowerCampus was approximately $1.0 million.  Aurora College faculty and staff have been using elements of PowerCampus since July 2019, with ongoing training throughout the first year of the implementation. Students gained access to the PowerCampus last week.

832,2020-03-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-phase-one-strengthening-foundation-aurora-college-and-planning-change,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Phase One: Strengthening the Foundation of Aurora College and Planning for Change,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, the transformation of Aurora College into a world class polytechnic university is well underway. As the Legislative Assembly is aware, the transformation will happen in three phases. We are currently in Phase One, which is what I want to talk about today. Phase One is focused on strengthening the foundation of the existing college, ensuring we understand the detailed steps ahead of us, and determining what we, as a territory, want the polytechnic university to be. The first step in Phase One was the development of a vision for postsecondary education. This vision was developed with direct input from the public, Indigenous governments, and postsecondary institutions operating in the Northwest Territories. The vision is that quote “Every resident of the Northwest Territories has an equitable opportunity to reach their full potential by obtaining a postsecondary education from institutions that are student centered, accessible, high quality, relevant and accountable.” End quote.  To help realize this vision, five goals were developed:  prioritize students’ success,  increase access to postsecondary education opportunities,  remain responsive to labour demands in the Northwest Territories,  remain responsive to local and regional needs; and  support the growth of the knowledge economy.  The vision and goals will help guide us as we make decisions, as will the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Calls for Justice, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The transformation is a collaborative effort between Aurora College and Education, Culture and Employment. The joint Executive Leadership Committee from the College and Education, Culture and Employment is responsible for leading the transformation within Aurora College, supported by working groups made up of Aurora College employees.  Much of the work that has already been completed, and is currently underway, is focused on strengthening the foundations of the College. A comprehensive policy review is being undertaken, to ensure that the College’s policies and processes meet national standards. A highlight of this work is the recently developed and adopted Academic Program Review Framework, which conforms to the standards outlined in the Council of Ministers of Educations’ Ministerial Statement on Quality Assurance of Degree Education in Canada. This replaced a previous program review process which fell short in areas of quality assurance, and did not ensure reviews were conducted at arm’s length. To support this type of work, as well as other aspects of the transformation, Phase One has also seen the creation of an Academic Advisory Council. This body, made up eight highly-regarded academic institutions with relevant experience, provides support and guidance on the technical aspects of the transformation. We are also re-envisioning what it means to be learning centred, by identifying what we already do well and developing additional, innovative solutions to support students. This is being accomplished by setting service standards for all phases of a student’s life cycle, starting at the point that a student begins to consider applying to the College, and continuing through the application process, the transition to college life, the time spent as a student, program completion, and transitioning out of the college and into the job market.  To support the student experience, the College just launched a new Student Information System. This system gives students, for the first time, the ability to apply for programs, select classes, check marks, and access their information online. This is a major milestone for the College, and brings it in line with major academic institutions across the country.  On the back end, this system will also provide the College with up-to-date data that will help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the College and the student experience. Mr. Speaker, the student experience can vary greatly depending on what you are studying, and where you are studying it. In recognition of this, we will soon begin work on a Regional Needs Assessment. The goal of this work is to understand how residents currently access adult and postsecondary education, how they would like to access it, and the barriers to access that they face. The information gathered through the Regional Needs Assessment will be absolutely vital in ensuring that we are designing a polytechnic university that best serves our residents.  This year, we will also begin our Capital Planning Study. Aurora College has some beautiful facilities, and certain campuses and learning centres can likely accommodate significant growth, but we know there are improvements that we need to make in order to offer the world class experience students deserve. Before the end of Phase One, we will have a capital plan that will lay out the physical nature of the future polytechnic university. This work will go hand in hand with our work to determine Areas of Specialization. Each campus has natural advantages due to their locations and the facilities that currently exist. We want to build on those advantages, and ensure that as we move forward we are strengthening each campus and bolstering our community learning centres.  Mr. Speaker, the transformation is a monumental undertaking. That will soon come into clear view, when we release our Implementation Plan, which outlines the steps and timelines in the transformation over the next six years. To help keep us on track, ground decision-making, and guide the direction of the college as it continues through the transformation process we will be releasing a 3-year Strategic Plan for Aurora College later this year.  Mr. Speaker, as I have stated before, we cannot do this alone, and we are not going to try to. Members of the public, Indigenous governments, industry, and Members of this House, will all have opportunities to contribute to the transformation.  Mr. Speaker, Phase One: Strengthening the Foundation and Planning for Change is planned to be completed by the fall of 2021, at which point we move into Phase Two: Transformational Change. In Phase Two, we will start making the wide ranging changes to the structure of the College that will bring us closer to our ultimate goal. I will speak more about Phase Two in the coming weeks.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
833,2020-03-05,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-international-womens-day,Government Website,Diane Thom: International Women's Day,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge International Women’s Day.  International Women’s Day is held annually on March 8th to celebrate women and girls’ social, cultural and political achievements throughout history, across nations, and to raise awareness about the work left to be done.  The theme of this year’s International Women’s Day is Because of You.  As Minister Responsible for the Status of Women, and on behalf of all of Cabinet, I can proudly say that we are committed to continuing to work on achieving gender equality throughout our society.  The theme Because of You celebrates women who work at advancing gender equality in all areas of our society for women and girls.  The theme also asks Canadians to honour role models in their own lives.   Here in the Northwest Territories, we have many examples of outstanding role models who have made a difference.  The Honourable Nellie Cournoyea is one such role model.  She served as Premier from 1991 to 1995.  She was not only the first female Premier of the Northwest Territories, she was the first female Indigenous Premier elected, and the second female Premier to serve in Canadian history.   Another role model is Ethel Blondin-Andrew, who continues to advocate on behalf of the Sahtu and represented the people of the Northwest Territories as the first Indigenous woman elected to the Parliament of Canada.  The late Bertha Allen who co-founded the Native Women’s Association of the NWT was also a very important role model for many, as she fought tirelessly for social change and the advancement of Indigenous women and girls.   Other examples of Northern women who stand as our role models include Lyda Fuller, a longtime Executive Director of the YWCA here in Yellowknife.  Ms. Fuller is a nationally recognized advocate for women and girls.  She is a strong voice in the fight against, family violence, homelessness and poverty.  Another example is Leela Gilday, who is a well-known recording artist who not only incorporates but celebrates her Indigenous heritage in her music.  These are just a few examples of the strong women role models that we have here in the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, these women, along with many others, have worked hard to achieve their goals and to make a difference in their communities and in the North.  Some are prominent figures and some work quietly behind the scenes.  However they choose to achieve their goals, they are making a difference and they are creating change.  It is only right that we should acknowledge and celebrate the difference they are making. In keeping with this year’s theme, I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and honour my esteemed female colleagues sitting with us in this House.  Each of us, individually, when we decided to put our names forth to become a Member of this Legislative Assembly, sent a message that women can be effective leaders, that we can make a difference and that we were willing to do the job required to make positive change.  Being willing to pursue an elected position is not a decision one makes lightly.   There are many challenges that women face when seeking a leadership role.  Role models inspire us to take on these leadership roles and I would like to give my heartfelt thanks to those women who inspire each of us in one way or another.  Mr. Speaker, the voters in the Northwest Territories set an example for the rest of Canada when they elected nine women to the Legislative Assembly, which created the first gender balanced Legislature in Canadian history.  We should be proud of this achievement and we should continue to work every day to achieve gender equity.  We must work together to move this forward.  I invite all Members of the Legislative Assembly to join me in recognizing International Women’s Day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
834,2020-03-04,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-northern-distance-learning,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Northern Distance Learning  ,"Check against delivery Mr. Speaker, today I want to focus on one of the successes that has come from the Education, Renewal and Innovation Framework. The Northern Distance Learning program, otherwise known as NDL, is a way to offer higher-level academic courses to high school students in small communities, to prepare them for postsecondary. By the upcoming 2020-2021 school year, this program will be available to students in up to 20 small communities across the territory. Northern Distance Learning program began at East Three School in Inuvik under the leadership of the Beaufort-Delta Divisional Education Council. The program proved that when students had opportunities to interact with each other, had access to in-class support staff and had dedicated, knowledgeable teachers, they were able to be successful whether sitting beside each other in the same classroom, or separated by hundreds of miles. There are currently 75 high school students in grades 10, 11 and 12 from small communities enrolled in Northern Distance Learning, taking academic, -1 courses in mathematics, science, English language arts, social studies, and art. Mr. Speaker, the course completion rate for traditional correspondence courses is just 30 percent. However, the completion rate for Northern Distance Learning courses is approximately 75 percent. It is a game changer, Mr. Speaker. Two years ago in Ulukhaktok, for the first time in the community’s history, three students graduated in their community with the courses they needed to advance directly to university. This was a historic moment for the community, and it was made possible by a combination of Northern Distance Learning, a lot of hard work and dedication by those graduates.  The expansion of the program also into the South Slave allowed Laney Beaulieu, a student from Fort Resolution, to stay in her community and complete the courses she needed to get into Western University in Ontario, where she is currently studying medicine.   Marie Lennie, a current Northern Distance Learning student from Délı̨nę, voiced her support for the program in an online video made for one of her NDL classes: quote “The experience so far is great,” she said. “I’m learning new things every day and succeeding in getting quality education without the need to move somewhere else for schooling. I highly recommend NDL for other Indigenous students who want a better education.” End quote. In addition to creating new learning opportunities, Northern Distance Learning is now also being used to allow parents in small communities to attend Parent-Teacher conferences with teachers in Inuvik. The first conference was held this past December, and connected parents, teachers, and in-class support staff spread across different communities.  Mr. Speaker, finally I want to celebrate Northern Distance Learning’s first ever Post-Secondary Bridging Experience that was held this past October with a group of 12 NDL students. The Northern Youth Abroad program organized and supervised a trip to Calgary, to help students get a better sense of what to expect in a postsecondary setting outside of the Northwest Territories. Students visited the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology and Mount Royal University and took part in workshops and activities that will help prepare them for the transition to postsecondary life. Akesha Hardisty-Norwegian from Fort Simpson commented, quote “I really liked the planning part because there is not much help in small communities. When they do help, they do not have as much info as what we got on the trip. Thank you for giving us this opportunity. It helped raise my awareness and confidence going into post-secondary.” End quote.Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled to share that on November 22, 2019, Akesha was accepted to the University of Alberta in the combined Kinesiology/Education program for September 2020. Others are looking at postsecondary options across Canada in psychology, architecture, justice studies, veterinary medicine, and recreation management.  Mr. Speaker, we all know that we have to do a better job delivering equitable education across the territory, and Northern Distance Learning is helping us level the playing field by giving students in small communities opportunities that did not exist only a few short years ago. The data, and the individual experiences, show us that this program is working. We still have a long way to go, and the achievements of Northern Distance Learning students are proof that we can, and will continue to, improve educational outcomes across the territory. Mahsı, Mr. Speaker."

836,2020-03-03,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-promoting-importance-oral-health,Government Website,Diane Thom: Promoting Importance of Oral Health,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, good oral health is important to our overall health and quality of life.  Healthy mouths and teeth in children promote healthy growth, nutrition, speech development, good school performance and social well-being.  Cavities, however, are the most common chronic infectious childhood disease, and they place a substantial burden on our population.  Poor oral health contributes to a child’s inability to eat, speak, sleep and learn.  In adults, oral disease has been linked to diabetes, heart disease, pneumonia and Alzheimer’s. Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that while dental treatment services are not an insured service paid for by the NWT Health Care Plan, our government is working to reduce oral disease among children and youth through the Oral Health Action Plan released in October 2018.   This Plan outlines four key action areas to improve oral health outcomes to promote oral health throughout the entire NWT population; to establish systematic supports for improved oral health services; to implement the NWT Oral Health Service Delivery Model; and to provide high quality, sustainable and culturally-safe care. Some highlights of what has been done since the release of the Action Plan include the addition of a Registered Dental Hygienist in Norman Wells and the roll out of daily brushing programs in daycares and schools in our communities. There have also been investments in dental equipment across the territory by the federal government to support the delivery of dental services in communities where there are no established dental clinics.   As part of this Action Plan, frontline primary health care providers have begun to integrate oral health screening and education for children and expectant mothers during Prenatal and Well Child Record appointments as well.   The Department of Health and Social Services and health Authorities are also collaborating with community partners to deliver a multi-age group oral health literacy program.  This program will feature arts-based learning in schools and at community gatherings.  Finally, a territory-wide oral health social marketing campaign will be launched this spring to encourage better oral health self-care to improve oral health outcomes in the NWT.  Mr. Speaker, research shows that starting good oral health practices in early childhood will ensure that children will continue to practice brushing and flossing as part of their daily routine.  This is why we partnered with the NWT Literacy Council to provide parents with a brushing song book that they can sing along with their children aged one to four.  Our Ever Awesome NWT Brushing Song book, which I will be tabling later today, was illustrated by Neiva Mateus and written by Tłı̨chǫ Dene author Richard Van Camp. Funding was provided by the federal governments’  Children’s Oral Health Initiative.  The aim of the book is to provide parents with a resource that makes brushing and flossing with their children something that is a fun, daily, family activity.  The brushing song book also promotes the importance of snuggling, reading to one another, and sharing time with each other. It honours the gift of family by looking after their health and spending time together. Over the months of March and April, Richard Van Camp will be touring communities in the NWT to raise awareness about the book and the importance of oral health. The book will be translated into all the NWT official Indigenous languages, and the audio files for the song will be made available on the Department’s website. An animated storyboard promoting oral health for older children is also being produced in all the NWT official languages.  We are looking forward to the first screening of this original media project later this summer. Mr. Speaker, oral health is an important part of our overall health.  This book is one of many resources that we will be developing for parents and caregivers to help them teach good oral health practices to their children.  I want to thank Richard Van Camp, Neiva Mateus, and the NWT Literacy Council for partnering with us to raise awareness about good oral health.  I encourage all parents to embrace the idea of fun-filled brushing and flossing time with their children, and encourage everyone to give oral health the time and respect it deserves as an important part of overall health and wellbeing. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Having those strong networks of your longtime friends and family around you has impacts on your health as you age.  Having the supports to age-in-place in your home community will improve the quality of life for seniors and may prevent early admission to long-term more-intensive care facilities. I am pleased to advise Members that we will be ready to open the new Fort Good Hope Seniors Centre this Spring.  This centre is the last of five seniors centres that were designed in conjunction with the Department of Health and Social Services, taking into consideration local guidance and input.  The development of these units has improved the lives of seniors in Aklavik, Fort Liard, Fort McPherson, Whatì, and soon Fort Good Hope.  These complexes feature eight units that will be occupied by seniors and one unit will be designated as a caretaker unit.  An on-site caretaker improves the safety and security of the building.  As part of the design, these buildings feature common areas where therapeutic and lifestyle programming can be delivered to seniors.   The design includes no-step entrances to suites, wider doorways, and a common space that is used for delivery of Health and Social Services programming. Mr. Speaker, seniors are the bedrock of our lives. They have been there for us since the day we were born. They have given so much to us.  Their knowledge, their guidance and their love.  As such, we needed to take the time and use the necessary resources to ensure that these units were built to the best standard available.  It is important that we give back to the ones that have given us so much.  I look forward to opening this facility and celebrating with Elders and their families as they move in to their new home. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  "
839,2020-03-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-colorectal-cancer-awareness-month,Government Website,Diane Thom: Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, we all want better health for our families and communities.  The choices we make are important for our overall health and well-being.  By eating good food, being physically active, reducing the amount of alcohol we drink, living tobacco free, and making healthy choices, we can help reduce the risk of getting chronic diseases like cancer. Cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada, and it is important that we talk about it.  Over the past few decades, we have learned more about cancer, which is resulting in more people surviving cancer than ever before.  This is why it is important to observe cancer awareness months.  Mr. Speaker, this month is Colorectal Awareness Month, and it is dedicated to raising awareness about colorectal cancer and honouring those who have been affected by this disease.  Colorectal cancer is preventable and treatable, yet here in the Northwest Territories, the incidence of being diagnosed with colorectal cancer is twice the rate than in the rest of Canada.  Many people are unaware that they can reduce the risk of getting it with timely screening and healthy lifestyles.  Mr. Speaker, the best protection we have against colorectal cancer is early detection. Taking a Fecal Immunochemical Test, or FIT test, is the easiest way for NWT residents to learn if they are at risk of colorectal cancer.  In an effort to improve screening and early detection, a “one and done” FIT screening method was introduced in 2018.  This approach makes it easier for people to collect a sample at home and return it to their healthcare provider.  The FIT test, which you can easily do at home, is recommended for residents aged 50 to 74 and should be completed at least every two years. 	To increase screening rates for colorectal cancer in our territory, Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority just launched a pilot project in February to mail FIT screening kits to eligible residents.  The pilot project focuses on the Beaufort-Delta Region.  If this approach is successful it will be expanded across the territory.  Our aim is to increase our participation screening rate to meet the national goal of 60%. Mr. Speaker, we have also distributed Community Cancer Awareness kits to community health representatives.  Health care staff can use these comprehensive kits in their communities to raise awareness and have conversations with residents about the importance of early screening and healthy living.  In February, the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority also launched two educational cancer videos.  Part of a seven part series, these videos aim to help residents better understand cancer and the importance of screening in the NWT.  These videos were created in partnership with the Department of Health and Social Services and the University of Alberta’s Indigenous and Global Health Research group.  The videos were developed through community consultations in the NWT and incorporated feedback from community members in Fort Good Hope, Inuvik, and Yellowknife.  Residents can view them on the cancernwt.ca website.  The videos were also distributed to local health centres for use, and will be promoted on social media.  While it is important to improve screening rates and to communicate directly about cancer with NWT residents, it is also critical that we support those patients who are battling cancer right now.  We know that the emotional and physical effects of cancer can make it difficult for cancer patients to process information.  To help support patients and their families, the NWT Health Authority has hired and trained two full-time cancer Nurse Navigators.  The Nurse Navigators are specially trained to help patients and their families throughout their cancer journey. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage all residents, particularly those aged 50 to 74, to speak to their health care providers about getting screened.  Let us work together to promote healthy living, reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers, and support those who are living with it.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
840,2020-03-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-conservation-network-gathering,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Conservation Network Gathering,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, the 19th Legislative Assembly believes our decisions must reflect a full understanding of our communities and regions. It is our responsibility to ensure that the needs of our residents are reflected in the decisions that will impact them.  This is especially important when it comes to decisions about the land, Mr. Speaker. That’s why our northern Indigenous governments and communities are at the heart of our northern approach to establishing and managing protected areas. The Northwest Territories is a leader in Canada when it comes to conservation planning. We work closely with our Indigenous partners to protect the Northwest Territories’ natural and cultural diversity.  Today, I am pleased to tell you about a gathering that was held in Yellowknife recently to help advance this important work. On February 26th and 27th, 2020, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources hosted this territory’s first Conservation Network Gathering. The idea behind this gathering, Mr. Speaker, is to share experiences and build partnerships to manage territorial protected areas under the new Protected Areas Act. More than 100 partners from across the Northwest Territories took part in the two-day gathering, including Indigenous governments and organizations, territorial and federal departments, funders, academics and conservation leaders from across Canada. Topics discussed included: new ideas in conservation and stewardship; the role of Indigenous guardians; and on-the-land success stories. They also talked about the financial realities of protected areas, and best practices for management and research. Healthy Land, Healthy People is our five-year plan for conservation network planning. It lays out how the Government of the Northwest Territories is moving forward together with its partners to protect the integrity of our northern ecosystems. Protected areas can also provide new job opportunities for small communities, 	Mr. Speaker. Guardian programs, land-based products and cultural tourism are all ways we can expand and diversify our economy. Over the coming months, Environment and Natural Resources will work closely with our partners to develop a new Healthy Land, Healthy People work plan to guide us over the next five years. Mr. Speaker, we need to hear from all stakeholders as we determine a path forward. That is why I am pleased to confirm that we have secured federal funding for the next three years to make the Conservation Network Gathering an annual event. Mr. Speaker, we look forward to working together to develop the next made-in-the-North conservation work plan, to keep our land healthy for current and future Northerners and visitors to enjoy.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
841,2020-03-02,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-invest-canada-north-partner-highlight,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Invest Canada North Partner Highlight ,"Check against delivery  Good Morning and thank you for being here with us today.  It’s so great to have Invest Canada North taking place this year during PDAC – it will inevitably open up opportunities for our Northern territories, in a way that we’ve not previously experienced at this conference. Across the North and in the NWT we recognize that competition for exploration and development dollars is strong, but I believe we offer unique benefits for those looking to do business, and I am going to tell you what those are.  One of the really important factors that I want to reassure potential investors of is that increasing resource development and exploration in the Northwest Territories is a priority for the newly elected government.  This is essential because that means that when you come to our territory and want to do business, we are there to help you along the way, and have just as much invested in your project and the path you take.  The Northwest Territories has often been known as the home of Canadian Diamonds. But we’re more than that.  If you were at the ICN Reception last night, you may have heard in the video our Premier state that investments in the NWT are more than just investments in our people.  She said that when you invest in the Northwest Territories, you’re doing more than investing in our people; you’re also contributing to world-wide efforts to fuel our global green economy.  As the federal government drives its agenda of innovation and technology, attention and awareness is growing regarding the NWT’s strategic and critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, tungsten and rare earth elements. We also still have some of the largest confirmed deposits of gold, zinc, and other base metals in the country.  There is so much potential in the Northwest Territories, but that isn’t the whole story. You need to have a solid foundation of support and partnership to realize the full benefits, and we’re leading the way in this area as well.  Investors want to know that the people and the place they’re doing business, is in support. Well, I already told you that the government is on board, but what I haven’t told you is that so are our residents.  Northerners support mining. 86% of NWT residents believe a strong mining sector is vital to the long-term health of the NWT and 82% want to see more mining projects in our territory.  NWT residents and businesses support mining because they are an important part of our mining sector.   Mining has driven the NWT economy for a long time.  Many of the territories leaders worked in mines and the exploration sector. When the diamond mines arrived, it was a natural evolution to get involved.   Indigenous governments in our territory also have a vested interest.  They share in the resource royalties paid by our mines and their development corporations work in the resource sector.  In the NWT, we have passed modern, competitive, made-in-the North legislation to govern our industry. Our government has committed to completing a review of our territory’s premier incentive program for mining and to identify new ways to support advanced projects, and increase funding for mining incentive programs by 50% over the next four years.  We’re investing in new geoscience to map our potential in exciting areas for explorers, including work in the Slave Geological Province — one of the highest-potential mineral regions in Canada. And our government has a million dollar Mining Incentive Program available to prospectors and exploration companies carrying out mineral exploration in our territory. By trade, I am what I like to call a boots-on-the-ground project engineer, and I wanted to run for politics partially because I felt that my background would give me a unique edge that could help this industry.  I have experienced firsthand some of the difficulties doing business in the North can entail, and I can promise you that I am personally ready to work with you, and have my departments working to enhance the programs and services that will support your ventures. The Government of the Northwest Territories has a unique approach to mineral exploration and development in the NWT.  It is based on the fundamental fact that northerners want new mines, our economy needs new mines, and we all want them done in a way which reflects our territory’s values.  The approach is built on partnerships with industry stakeholders and the Indigenous governments that make up our territory, and is built on mutual respect and the recognition that each of us can contribute to the success of the others, to maximize benefits for all.  Through Socio-Economic Agreements established by our government with mining companies and 25 years of working together, we have built a made-in-the-NWT workforce and service sector. Our people are seeing a real and tangible reason to stay in school and pursue higher learning.  They are doing more than taking on labour jobs. They are going to skilled trade schools and universities, and coming home schooled in mining related fields like heavy duty mechanics, engineering and geosciences.  Our Indigenous governments own and operate the companies that service the mines.  This has built a strong indigenous business community. They own construction, logistics, transportation and now mining companies.  Some have even expanded from our territory to service industry in Alberta and across Canada."
842,2020-03-01,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-launch-canadian-minerals-and-metals-action-plan-pdac,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Launch of Canadian Minerals and Metals Action Plan at PDAC,"Check against delivery  Good afternoon, and welcome again to everyone.   Before I start, I’d like to welcome my Ministerial counterparts and all the stakeholders and Indigenous representation both in the audience and on stage with us this afternoon.  This is my first PDAC experience as Minister of ITI and Infrastructure, and I am pleased that my first PDAC speaking engagement is at an important one like this.  Announcements like the one today, demonstrate the influence that strong partnerships can make. Together, these kinds of partnerships are leading the way back to prosperity in the NWT, across the North and for all of Canada.  The Northwest Territories is acutely aware of how critical it is that Canada continues to be a recognized world leader in sustainable and respectful mineral development, and exploration. I have said it before, that collaboration will improve our collective fortunes, and I believe the coming together in support of this Action Plan, demonstrates this is one of the pieces that will guide us to that goal.  This action plan builds on the framework set by the Strategy that was released exactly one year ago, and I want to thank the Government of Canada for its work in setting the course.  It identifies a way for us to speak with one voice as we attract investment from across the globe.   It is our roadmap to partnership at all levels of government to further geoscience research which can bring more attention to mineral potential and the resource-rich land, we call home.  It is a guide to increasing our investments in innovation which will keep Canada on the cutting-edge in the mineral industry, and it is a call to take leadership on climate change, while still using the strength of our resources to build a sustainable future.  The Northwest Territories will do its part to see this action plan through, and will continue to work with our partners to collaborate and share our strengths.   It is my hope that this action plan will also feed into other priorities essential to realizing our mineral prosperity.   Priorities projects like the Taltson expansion project, and Slave Geological Province Corridor, both of which will help connect resource-rich regions of the NWT to markets, help green the mining industry, and lower operating costs.  Investment’s in Canada’s North are investments for all Canadians, and I look forward to Canada’s continued support in realizing these transformative projects.   Thank you again to the leadership of Natural Resources Canada, and our partner province and territories, towards this shared path forward.  I am excited to work with all our partners to realize our vision of Canada as a leaders in mining. "
843,2020-02-28,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-taking-next-steps-nwt-film-and-media,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Taking the Next Steps in NWT Film and Media,"Mr. Speaker, each year the Dead North Film Festival inspires people from across the Arctic to get out and shoot short film creations in the depths of winter. It also brings Northerners together to support the film sector and have fun at this horror and fantasy genre event.  This year marks the eighth year for the Dead North Film Festival.  The GNWT’s Film Commission, in the Department of Industry, Tourism, and Investment, has been a supporter and sponsor from the beginning.  The annual festival has become a staple in the Yellowknife film calendar, providing professionals and newcomers alike the chance to dip their toes in the creative economy. Since Dead North was established in 2012, over 170 short films have been produced, and audiences come out in droves to see the results. As the NWT’s presence on the global film industry continues to grow, this northern event has also become a jumping-off point for the participation of NWT productions in southern festival tours.   Mr. Speaker, this year’s submissions for the Dead North Film Festival set a new record and I would like to congratulate the festival’s founders and organizers, the Artless Collective for their vision, the work they have done, and the success that they have enjoyed.  As this year’s Dead North Film Festival wraps up this weekend, I encourage Members to get out and take in the screenings and events.  I would also like to use this opportunity to update Members on the work and investments we are undertaking to create even more opportunities for our film and media industry.  Five years ago, Mr. Speaker, the NWT Film Commission launched Take One, the territory’s first film strategy.  Through its implementation and our own government investments, the NWT has become known for award-winning films, circumpolar festivals, and one of a kind story telling.  Last year, the NWT Film Rebate Program leveraged almost $2.3 million in economic spending in the Northwest Territories.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to update our film strategy, and to take the next big step in the development of our creative economy.  To do this, the department has launched the Let’s Talk Film and Media campaign to consider what the next phase of film and media growth in our territory should look like. Together, with the NWT Professional Media Association, Industry, Tourism and Industry will be hosting a visioning workshop with representatives from across the NWT’s film sector.  We’re reaching out to leaders, municipalities, and stakeholders across the North to get their input. Through an online idea board and discussion forums, we have started a territory-wide conversation with NWT residents about film and media development in our territory.    Mr. Speaker, in this government’s mandate, we have highlighted the importance of increasing economic diversification by supporting growth in non-extractive sectors. Collectively, our vision is for a territory where there is rewarding work available for NWT residents across all sectors, and this includes film. Our territory is home to a vibrant screen-based media production industry built upon the dedicated efforts of both local and guest producers committed to telling our stories to the world. The product of their work and passion does more than generate employment and spending for actors, technical staff, and suppliers of goods and services. It also helps to showcase our incredible landscapes, cultures, traditions, and iconic landmarks to the world. When it was introduced in 2015, the GNWT’s first-ever film strategy established two broad goals for the actions and investments it identified: Increase the number and quality of local independent film and television production with market interest; and  Increase the number of guest productions that engage NWT residents and their services.  With success on both fronts, it is time to advance our growing industry to the next level.  In the coming weeks, Mr. Speaker, Members may see or receive messages on their social media platforms saying: Let’s talk Film and Media.  I encourage you to join the conversation, and to share the opportunity with your constituents, so that together we can share ideas on what the future of film and media looks like in the NWT.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
844,2020-02-28,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-wawzonek-payment-invoices,Government Website,Caroline Wawzonek: Payment of Invoices,"Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories wants NWT businesses to flourish. For small businesses in particular, prompt payment of invoices is critical to their financial health. As Minister, I can assure you that the Department of Finance places a high value on maintaining a positive working relationship with the companies the GNWT does business with. The Financial and Employee Shared Services, or FESS,  is the division responsible for processing and issuing payment for all supplier invoices for goods and services provided to all GNWT departments, the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation, and as of last month, the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority. FESS’s goal is to process payment for all suppliers within 20 to 30 days of receiving an invoice. Over the past couple of months, FESS has looked into the reasons why some payments are delayed. We have learned that changes that were made to how we process invoices may be causing unnecessary delays. In the past, suppliers sent their invoices directly to the GNWT departments and agencies they provided the goods and services to, rather than one central source. Over time, this shift has likely led to some confusion among suppliers on who they should be forwarding their invoices to, as well as uncertainty within departments and agencies on what to do when they receive an invoice. Mr. Speaker, it is the responsibility of the Department of Finance to make sure that suppliers clearly understand our processes, as well as how to access support when they encounter issues. As a response, the Department has updated its website to make certain that key information suppliers need is easily available, including: where and how to send invoices, what information is required for speedy processing, and how to sign up for direct deposit instead of waiting for a cheque to be delivered through the mail.  Within the coming months, we will also be sending resources directly to our suppliers to ensure that they are familiar with our processes and know who to contact when they need support. We will also ensure that employees in the departments and agencies supported by Financial and Employee Shared Services know that they should forward any invoices they receive without delay. Communications to vendors is one step in the process. We must also ensure that we are able to meet our internal processing deadlines. As you are aware, with the onboarding of the NTHSSA, the volume for FESS increased and as with any change, there are dips in production. We are continuing to monitor this and over time we will see these numbers pick back up. Mr. Speaker, I am confident that enhanced communication from the Department of Finance to our suppliers, and within our Government, continued monitoring of workflows and internal streamlining of processes, will help to address our suppliers’ concerns about payment delays, and we will continue to monitor this situation to ensure that all invoices are paid within our 20 to 30 day target. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "
845,2020-02-27,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-round-round,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Round-up of Round up,"Mr. Speaker, the 19th Legislative Assembly has identified increasing resource exploration and development for the benefit of the people of the Northwest Territories, as a priority for this government. In January, I attended the Association for Mineral Exploration Roundup in Vancouver with Premier Cochrane, Minister Thompson and staff from the departments of Infrastructure, Industry, Tourism and Investment, Environment and Natural Resources, Executive and Indigenous Affairs, and Lands in an effort to advance the interests of the NWT and work towards attaining this goal. We often talk about the benefits mines bring to a territory.  Our mines are huge operations requiring numerous products and services, and large, diverse workforces.  This means economic opportunities and benefits that begin to flow to NWT residents long before mines even open, in exploration activity and geoscience research spurred by the search for precious stones and minerals.  This is the focus of Roundup.  It is one of Canada’s largest mining conferences that draws delegates from around the world, including GNWT staff representing a number of departments, and representatives from NWT Indigenous governments and development corporations. It is an event that I first attended as an engineering student at UBC, and it was then, and continues to be today an important opportunity to promote our resource potential and strong partnership model to those who want to work with us to sustain and enhance our economy.   Mr. Speaker, exploration spending in our territory is projected to have decreased again last year to around $78 million. In past years, it has been as high as $150 to 200 million.  It is a critical investment that is missing in our economy.  This is something that we have already said needs to be a priority for our government.   It is money that is spent on helicopters, equipment, camps and supplies. If exploration companies need it, they buy it and NWT companies are the benefactors.   Just like the mines that they precede, exploration crews and logistics companies also hire locally, not just geologists and geophysicists, but expediters, line cutters, stakers, cooks, technicians, camp attendants, ramp hands, cleaners, and labourers. Mr. Speaker, our government’s approach for this year’s Roundup was to highlight the enormous potential that exists for those willing to be a part of responsible development in our territory; and to demonstrate, in tangible terms, the partnerships that we believe will realize new exploration opportunities.  We set the stage for our attendance this year by introducing an updated bedrock geology map and database for the mineral-rich Slave Geological Province, which is well known for its excellent mineral potential and the long, prosperous history of mining. On the Sunday preceding Roundup, Premier Cochrane helped to launch an exciting new partnership for our North. Backed by the Government of Canada and supported by Canada’s three territorial governments, the Invest Canada North Initiative will see a robust presence from northern Canada at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada Convention, taking place in Toronto next week, that will focus  exclusively on promoting investment opportunities in Canada’s North to national and international audiences.  As the business of Roundup got under way, two important media events showcased our territory’s innovation and leadership in partnered, Indigenous-led resource development.  I want to recognize the leadership of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, Det’on Cho Corporation, and Cheetah Resources. Their agreement to begin Canada’s first rare earth mining project, with the first Indigenous-led mine site, could be a game changer, not just for our territory, but our country. I also want to congratulate the Gwich’in Tribal Council and Inuvialuit Regional Corporation again for the release of their regional mineral development strategies. These strategies will serve both as roadmaps for mineral explorers and action plans for Indigenous governments as they seek to attract investment on their terms. Mr. Speaker, there were also a number of formal meetings and informal networking events during Roundup where the Premier, Minister Thompson and I spoke to the priority that our government will be giving to revitalizing exploration and development in our territory.  We highlighted our continuing work to impement new mineral legislation, updated industry representatives on transformative infrastructure projects that are taking shape, and listened proactively to concerns that were raised by our partners.  At every step, Mr. Speaker, we were able to point to economic reconciliation in action.  Our ongoing work with Indigenous governments was alongside of us, clearly communicated as part of, and in step with, our own government’s presence. Mr. Speaker, it was a powerful message, and it served to solidify the purpose of coming out in force to events like Roundup.  We need to take tangible steps to improve the investment landscape in our territory. It’s going to take more than just one Minister, one department, or one government.  Mr. Speaker, the annual Roundup conference remains an excellent opportunity to build relationships and seek out new partnerships which will build and benefit our territory.  I am pleased with the work of the GNWT at this year’s event and confident that in addition to highlighting our political support for this sector, that we were also able to demonstrate that the 19th Legislative Assembly is committed to reaching goals and making decisions in a more transparent and collaborative manner.   I look forward to our government building on these successes at Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada Convention and through the Invest Canada North initiative that begins this Sunday in Toronto, and will be happy to update the House and the public of those successes in the near future.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   "
846,2020-02-27,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-airport-improvements,Government Website,Katrina Nokleby: Airport Improvements,"Mr. Speaker, making strategic investments in our transportation system is one of the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly. Investing in airport improvements will keep our communities connected while reducing the cost of living and supporting economic opportunities. Given our vast territory and dispersed communities, air travel is essential for Northern residents, businesses, and tourists.  The Government of the Northwest Territories manages 27 public airports that support vital services including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, forest fire response, and much more. Investing in our airports not only improves the delivery of safe and efficient transportation, but also provides jobs, skills, training, and beneficial economic opportunities for communities and residents. In fact, a total of 158 Northerners are directly employed through our airports. This does not include jobs created through special projects, such as capital construction projects.  Mr. Speaker, today, I am pleased to provide an update on airport improvement projects throughout the Northwest Territories.  Beginning in Inuvik, there are three major projects planned for the Mike Zubko Airport.  These include: A new air terminal building; Improvements to help protect permafrost and improve runway drainage; and The design of an extension to the existing runway. When the new air terminal building is completed, travellers will notice an improved passenger experience and an airport that better fits their needs. This includes upgraded public spaces, baggage systems, food concessions, airline operations, and improved accessibility. The Government of the Northwest Territories is working to keep the public informed and to provide opportunities for dialogue with residents and businesses. This month the Department of Infrastructure held two public meetings and one contractor meeting in Inuvik to discuss the new Air Terminal Building. The project is already providing a boost to local employment, as a local business was contracted to demolish the pre-existing hangar on the build site. Construction of the new Air Terminal Building is expected to be complete as soon as 2023. The second project at the Inuvik Airport will result in airfield upgrades to protect permafrost and improve drainage. A total of $22 million in federal and territorial funding was announced last year for this project under the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund. This project will make the airport more resilient to the effects of climate change, one of the priorities of this Legislative Assembly. The runway and taxiway embankments will be reconstructed, to better protect the permafrost under the airport. Surface drainage improvements will also help direct water away from vulnerable areas. Design work for the airfield improvement projects is currently underway and is expected to be completed this fall. Once the design has been finalized, construction is expected to take approximately two years. Mr. Speaker, design work begins this summer on the Inuvik Airport runway extension project. Last year the federal government announced funding of up to $150 million for the project. This funding will be spread out over five years and will deliver major upgrades, including extending the length of the runway from 6,000 to 9,000 feet long. The project includes modernizing the lighting, navigational, and military aircraft landing arrestor systems. This investment will support a greater variety of military aircraft, while reducing the strain on aircraft that already serve the airport. The runway extension will help increase Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic, and benefit local travelers and businesses that rely on this airport. Mr. Speaker, for many communities across the North, air travel is an essential service. For this reason, airport maintenance and improvement activities are particularly important to ensure safe and efficient travel. With this in mind, the Department of Infrastructure is also completing work at some of our smaller airports. For example, we are undertaking drainage improvements at Sachs Harbour, Aklavik, Hay River, and Sambaa K’e airports. This work will increase the resiliency of these airports to the effects of climate change. Mr. Speaker, improvements are also ongoing at the Yellowknife Airport. As the largest and busiest aviation gateway to the North, Yellowknife Airport continues to focus on improvements for travellers as well as new economic opportunities. The airport recently transitioned to common-use terminals, which will allow airlines to share counter space based on flight schedules, creating increased flexibility and better use of the check-in area. Upgrades were also recently completed to the baggage system and security screening areas of the airport, underscoring our commitment to a safe and secure facility. Mr. Speaker, in addition to improvements to the passenger experience, the airport has been busy making operational improvements. While not always visible to the public, these investments are crucial to the safe and efficient operation of airports. To help define long-term goals at the Yellowknife Airport, a 20-Year Master Plan will be finalized in the coming months.  In addition to these improvements at the Yellowknife Airport, our government is also pursuing economic opportunities related to cold-weather testing. Most recently, Airbus chose the Yellowknife Airport to test their newest aircraft: the Airbus A220. Our frigid temperatures make us the perfect destination for this type of testing. The A220 is already certified to minus 35 Celsius, but Airbus wants to certify the jet for minus 40 Celsius, which is why they brought it to Yellowknife. Airbus officials indicated the weather was ideal during their visit, and I thank the many Northern businesses and support groups who worked to make this opportunity possible. Going forward, the airport is focused on attracting more cold-weather testing opportunities. To support this, a dedicated working group has been established at the airport to provide resources and assist aeronautical decision-makers. Through this group’s work, the NWT can provide a wealth of knowledge for companies looking to test their equipment in the North.  Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories will continue to invest in all of our airports. By working closely with communities and the federal government to secure funding, we will keep our communities connected while supporting opportunities for Northerners. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

It sounds like you all had a full day yesterday, which I hope you found productive and inspiring.  I’m grateful for the chance to speak to all of you, and thank you in person for the incredible work you do. Keeping the land healthy is a priority for the Government of the Northwest Territories. Not just our natural environment, of course, but also our connection to the land. That’s why our communities are at the heart of conservation planning in the Northwest Territories. By protecting the areas that are important to our communities, we can help maintain our natural and cultural resources for generations to come. The conservation network in the NWT is diverse and evolving, and I am excited about upcoming opportunities. Yesterday, you talked about Indigenous guardian programs and ways to get more of our youth out on the land, and connecting to their culture. These kinds of programs are near to my heart, as they help to revitalize and strengthen our communities. Today you’ll hear about other ways protected areas can support communities to develop and diversity their local economy, through culture, education, tourism and recreation. Building a more diverse economy and creating jobs in small communities are priorities for the GNWT. As you know, sustainability is key. That’s why we continue to look for long-term funding options for our NWT protected areas. All of these conversations will help ensure we are building a conservation network that respects and protects the values of our communities and Indigenous partners. It is up to all of us to ensure our newly-established protected areas can fulfill their promise of contributing to social wellbeing, ecological health, sustainable livelihoods and economic prosperity. I look forward to continuing to work together to protect our land and northern way of life.  Thank you, and please enjoy the rest of the gathering.      "

Infrastructure projects bring skills, training, and economic opportunities to our communities and their residents. Infrastructure plays a very important role in the longevity and health of the people of the Northwest Territories. Mr. Speaker, during the last Assembly, the government completed work on the Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk Highway with the grand opening occurring just two years ago. This award winning project has had a huge impact on the region, helping to connect communities and increase the tourism potential of the Beaufort Delta. This past September, construction began on another new highway project: the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road and today I am happy to provide Members with an update.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that work on the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road is both ahead of schedule and on-budget. As of December, embankment construction had been completed for the first 36 kilometres, along with a number of culverts and drainage ditches. The project is scheduled for substantial completion by November 2021, and final completion in the fall of 2022. When the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road opens, this two-lane gravel highway will cover a distance of 97 kilometres and provide year-round access from Highway number 3 to Whatı̀. This project will help to connect communities; support employment and training opportunities; increase our territory’s resiliency to climate change; and create new social and economic opportunities.  Already, we are seeing the benefits this project is having for our residents and communities.  By December 2019, close to six thousand hours of cumulative training had already taken place through the Tłı̨chǫ Resident Training program. This includes training in job readiness, heavy equipment operation, camp cooking, and first aid. As well, as of December 2019, 137 workers were working on site. Nearly half of these workers are Northwest Territories’ residents, including 35 per cent who are Tłı̨chǫ Citizens. Approximately 40 per cent of business contracts for this project have also gone to Northern businesses. Mr. Speaker, the GNWT is working closely with the Tłı̨chǫ Government on this project. The Tłı̨chǫ Government is an equity partner in North Star Infrastructure, with whom the GNWT has a Public-Private Partnership, or P3, Project Agreement to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain the road. As demonstrated through projects such as the Mackenzie Valley Fibre Link, P3s can be a successful way to advance major projects while achieving the best value for money for the government and taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that in November, the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road was one of five projects to be recognized by the prestigious Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships.  As one of the first P3s in North America with an Indigenous government holding a cash-funded equity stake, the project won gold in the National Awards for Innovation and Excellence in Public-Private Partnerships.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our P3 Partners, both the Tłı̨chǫ Government, and Kiewit Canada Development Company, on this significant achievement. Mr. Speaker, investing in public infrastructure is a core responsibility of government that benefits our residents and supports economic development across the territory.  In the long-term, the Tłı̨chǫ All-Season Road is expected to reduce the cost of living for the region and support new social opportunities, while helping to attract additional interest from industry in the exploration and development of natural resources.  This highway continues to be a priority for the GNWT and the Tłı̨chǫ. I will continue to provide updates as we progress through the project timelines and look forward to the day when our residents can drive to and from Whatı̀ all year round, not just during the winter.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
850,2020-02-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-pink-shirt-day,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Pink Shirt Day,"Check Against Delivery  Mr. Speaker, no one in the Northwest Territories, especially our children and youth, should ever have to endure bullying. Our schools and communities must be safe spaces for all students and the responsibility to ensure this happens is one we all share. I am pleased to announce today, on Pink Shirt Day, the formal release of the Guidelines for Ensuring LGBTQ2S+ Equity, Safety and Inclusion in Northwest Territories Schools. In 2007, Nova Scotia teenagers David Shepherd and Travis Price organized a protest after a male grade 9 student in their school was harassed for wearing a pink shirt. The next morning, these two youth brought pink shirts to hand out to all the male students. Their school was full of kids in pink that day. Thirteen years later, Pink Shirt Day has become a global call to action as schools and workplaces around the world are flooded with pink in solidarity against bullying. The national theme for 2020 is Lift Each Other Up, and I am happy to see so much pink around the House today, as we stand together on Pink Shirt Day. Across the Northwest Territories, we have worked with our education and community partners to combat bullying. As I am sure all Members of this House are aware, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer/Questioning, and Two-Spirit youth, or LGBTQ2S+, experience greater discrimination compared to their heterosexual and cis-gender peers. They have higher instances of mental health issues, substance abuse, lack of school attendance, violence, and suicide.  The Department of Education, Culture, and Employment is aware of the unique challenges that LGBTQ2S+ students face in school, at home, and in their community. Research shows that having strong anti-bullying policies and guidelines result in lower levels of bullying victimization, greater school safety, and less social aggression. As well, students in schools that run Genders and Sexualities Alliances, or GSAs, are at a lower threat for risky behaviours, like alcohol and substance use. They also report increased psychological well-being and function.   Mr. Speaker, the department is committed to supporting diversity among school staff, students and families. As a part of Education Renewal and Innovation, the Guidelines for Ensuring LGBTQ2S+ Equity, Safety and Inclusion align with the Safe Schools Regulations, the Territorial Schools Code of Conduct, the Northwest Territories Human Rights Act and the Government of the Northwest Territories Harassment Free and Respectful Workplace Policy. There are 13 promising practices that can be integrated into any school.  These practices are evidence-based, tangible calls to action, through collaboration with the Rainbow Coalition of Yellowknife, FOXY, and SMASH, and with feedback from our education partners.  Some of the most valuable insight in the Guidelines came from youth who attended the first Rainbow Youth Conference in 2017. LGBTQ2S+ and ally students across the North developed music, visual art, spoken word poetry, and videos featuring messages of inclusion and support. The students shared their ideas on what needs to happen to ensure their schools are respectful, caring and safe for everyone.  We will be hosting the second Rainbow Youth Conference this spring, and sharing the new Guidelines with the students. Community and Territorial leaders will also have the opportunity to hear their stories at the Lunch with Leaders; I hope you all attend. I truly hope the students see themselves in the work and know that their input has helped break down barriers to understanding.  Mr. Speaker, Northwest Territories schools should be safe and caring environments for the entire school community. With the release of the Guidelines, the continued education and wellness partnerships, and most of all, the individuals and groups paving the way for inclusion and equity, I believe our schools can be the places of change where we respect each other’s differences, and recognize our similarities.   Mahsı, Mr. Speaker."
851,2020-02-26,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-strategic-oil-and-gas-receivership-process,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Strategic Oil and Gas Receivership Process,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, Strategic Oil and Gas Limited or “Strategic“ filed for creditor protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act in April 2019. Strategic operates the Cameron Hills, Northwest Territories Project which includes winter access roads, well sites, oil and gas gathering systems, a small pipeline, an oil and gas battery, a permanent camp and various incidental activities such as borrow pits, permanent bridges and sump sites.  The Government of the Northwest Territories has been monitoring and intervening in the ongoing court process to help ensure Northwest Territories interests are represented.  A receiver has been appointed by the Court to oversee the Northwest Territories’ assets of Strategic. The receiver, Alvarez and Marsal, is to take temporary custody of Strategic’s assets in the Northwest Territories, address regulatory obligations and attempt to sell the Northwest Territories assets, if possible. The proceeds of any sales will be used to cover regulatory obligations, and pay the company’s creditors.   In the Northwest Territories, the immediate regulatory obligations are to repair and suspend a leaking well, and suspend two other wells, by April 1, 2020.  There is currently enough money through existing securities to do this work and bring the site into compliance. Until the receivership process has been completed, it is impossible to say what the final costs to remediate the site might be, or who would be responsible for covering them. Strategic’s project was approved in 2010, before devolution.  At the time it was transferred to the GNWT, Strategic’s site was in operation and its permits were in order. The Government of the Northwest Territories had a reasonable expectation that it would continue its operations until it was wound down according to regulatory requirements.   While it is too early to predict the outcome of the ongoing receivership process, the Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to protecting the Northwest Territories’ land and environment and ensuring appropriate remediation is carried out on Strategic’s sites in the Northwest Territories.   Our government’s work to strengthen and improve the Northwest Territories regulatory framework continues, including ongoing work on how we calculate the amount of security we recommend to regulatory boards. The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to managing development responsibly and protecting the Northwest Territories’ land and environment, through careful regulation of future projects, and taking appropriate responsibility for the consequences of past projects when necessary. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

We have a vast geography, a wealth of resources and a population strengthened by incredible diversity. The 19th Legislative Assembly wants to see the Northwest Territories make the best possible use of all of our opportunities and resources, including the strength of our people, to achieve the 22 priorities that were set by all 19 members of this Assembly. These priorities stretch across all of our communities and are our shared vision for economic growth, environmental stewardship and a healthy and better educated population. Achieving these priorities will be a continuing journey that will outlast the life of the 19th Assembly and this government must make decisions in a way that looks beyond four years to the next generation. We have a responsibility to put the Northwest Territories on a good path using our priorities as a guide and establishing a budget and a fiscal plan to achieve as much distance towards these priorities as possible. It has been said that it is easier to destroy than to create. Think about an ice sculpture. Creating takes time. It requires patience. It succeeds with thoughtfulness and planning. This government wants to create a positive path forward for the future. Budget 2020 is a first step on a path towards our priorities, one for which we build relationships within our government, with our communities, and between governments. This Budget proposes to spend almost $1.9 billion on programs and services in the coming year and sets out further fiscal steps that will support progress on all 22 priorities. This Budget is a foundation upon which we will create and build. Shortly, I will review the Northwest Territories economic situation and outlook. I will describe some key drivers in our economy as well as some of our challenges. Next, I will discuss our fiscal situation and strategy, which speaks to some of the direct impacts that government can have toward positively influencing our economic situation. I will then describe our planned revenues and expenditures for the next fiscal year and conclude with a discussion about next steps for the financial health and planning of the Northwest Territories. I want to make two comments about how this Budget was prepared. First, this Budget was a collective effort. It stretches back to the last Assembly when departments were working on their plans for the coming year. We are always building on work from prior assemblies in a consensus government. In the relatively short time of four months since this Cabinet was formed, we have tried to chart a more inclusive approach to financial policy setting that better engages all Members. It is my intention to continue establishing opportunities throughout our processes for public dialogue and engagement with this Assembly. Evidence based decision making requires information and perspectives and potential decisions should, where possible, be vetted by those impacted. I want to thank all Members of this Assembly for their constructive ideas and work in building our financial plan for the next fiscal year and beyond. Second, in preparing this Budget we needed to take a realistic look at our fiscal challenges. Our immediate fiscal situation is not what was hoped in the last budget but it is manageable. We are not in a crisis. This is a time for cautious optimism. Achieving the priorities of this Assembly will require a disciplined approach and a plan to ensure that we are getting value for the money we are spending while preserving the ability to responsibly fund infrastructure needs in our communities and across the territory. Although this is next fiscal year’s operating budget, the revenues projected in this Budget must also partially pay for the 2020-21 capital budget that was approved last fall. More important, we must remember that we are on a longer journey and the first step taken in today’s Budget sets the direction for the financial plan over the next four years. Within our Budget we remain committed to responsible fiscal management. Just as this Budget is meant to provide a stable starting point for the future of the 19th Assembly within a context of change, our approach to financial management is changing progressively to deliver a better product to serve the goals of this government. Part of this change includes the use of four-year business plans, instead of an isolated annual version each year. We will regularly return to the business plan to evaluate our progress and performance so that we will know if we are getting the results and value we expect for the money we spend. We will also be focusing resources to improve evaluation and monitoring of key performance measures across sectors and programs. Many of the programs and services that government delivers cannot be measured purely by numbers. Much of what we do provides a social return that is going to need a more nuanced measure. Our goal is to ensure not only that residents of the Northwest Territories get the best monetary value for their dollar but that they get a positive social, cultural, educational, health and economic return on our collective investment.   Economic Outlook The financial foundation for all our priorities is a vibrant and diverse economy. The Macroeconomic Policy Framework is a set of measures used to assess the territory’s economic performance over time. It shows the economy has not recovered to its pre-recession peak in 2007. We know that circumstances have changed since then. Political and economic uncertainty across the world can significantly impact our small resource-based economy. In 2019, the Northwest Territories economy is expected to have shrunk 4.3 per cent, due to declines in diamond production and private-sector investment. Increases in government investment expenditures helped cushion the slowdown in private sector activity and saved the economy from a more severe decline. Government infrastructure investments are the prime driver in a 3.4 per cent increase in total private and public investment from 2019 to 2020. This year, economic growth is expected to improve, with real gross domestic product forecast to increase 3.8 per cent. However, this growth will only partially offset the real GDP decline from 2019, leaving the economy still smaller than it was two years ago. In short, the Northwest Territories economy is stable, but it is not growing. Economic stability does not describe the longer term outlook. The diamond mining industry has been our economic engine for the last two decades. However, the industry has matured, and all existing Northwest Territories diamond mines could be closed by 2030, with the first one ceasing operations within the next five years. Possible expansions may allow one or more of the diamond mines to continue to operate, but that remains uncertain just as there is no certainty of finding new economically viable deposits. The closure of the diamond mines will result in a large drop in economic output and there are no other confirmed projects on the horizon large enough to fill this gap. The role government can play in supporting economic growth should not be underestimated. Strategic infrastructure investments are key to supporting future economic growth and to supporting our people to be drivers of that growth. The Canadian economy is in the midst of re-structuring towards a more digital and service-centred economy and we want the Northwest Territories to be contributing members as this evolves. The GNWT has already invested in the basic infrastructure for a more digital economy with the Mackenzie Valley Fibre Link that gives better access to the global digital economy and countless new opportunities for Northerners. Government spending on programs, goods and services will provide stability to the economy by supporting Northern businesses, local wages, and household consumption. Public infrastructure investments such as roads, bridges, power corridors, and communications networks as well as schools, hospitals and community facilities will contribute to higher standards of living for Northerners, and to improved private sector business cases for future investments. Investing in physical and social infrastructure sets the Northwest Territories up for economic growth tomorrow. We will be guided by the principle that the expenditure of our public funds maximizes economic benefits to residents and local economies and supports Northern business.   Fiscal Situation and Outlook Mr. Speaker, our fiscal situation is not dire. However, unexpected revenue declines mean that the previous fiscal strategy objectives to increase fiscal capacity and eliminate the cash deficit were not achieved. 				We are expecting our operations budget from 2019-20 to show a deficit of $70 million. Although this is quite a distance from the $60 million operating surplus projected in last year’s budget, over one-third of the revenue loss is due to a reallocation of federal transfers for infrastructure projects from the 2019-20 fiscal year to 2020-21. In 2020-21, our operating budget is projected to show a surplus of $203 million. Over the next four years, we are currently projecting that average annual revenue growth will be greater than operating expenditure growth which allows us to project operating surpluses for the entire Assembly. However, after this year, the operating surpluses will start to decline, dropping to $147 million in 2021-22, $116 million in 2022-23 and then to $3 million in 2023-24. An operating surplus is only one part of our total financial picture. The operating budget is mainly the funding of day-to-day programs and services provided by government. The capital budget is where we show the funding of large-scale investments in infrastructure projects. Without a surplus in our operating budget, there is no cash available to put into our capital budget to pay for infrastructure investments. The less cash available from an operating surplus, the more we would have to borrow to continue to invest in capital projects. In the not too distant past, the Government of the Northwest Territories made large investments to help connect our communities with improved transportation networks such as highways, roads, bridges and airports. Large public investment has enhanced energy and communication infrastructure and built health facilities and schools. Despite these efforts, the Northwest Territories remains in a significant infrastructure deficit compared to much of the rest of Canada. Many communities have no road access, limited internet connectivity and rely on diesel to generate heat and power. Several of our communities have small and aging school facilities that accommodate only one or two teachers to cover classes from kindergarten to grade 12. The Northwest Territories’ core housing need is among the highest in Canada. Surpluses in the operating budgets are not large enough on their own to support the kind of large-scale investments we need to catch the Northwest Territories up to a similar level of infrastructure seen elsewhere in Canada. Borrowing has been and will remain necessary to make strategic infrastructure investments. Remaining fiscally responsible includes managing our debt. Our debt level is approaching the federally-imposed borrowing limit of $1.3 billion and current projections show that we will be over the limit by 2021-22. The Department of Finance uses a variety of measures to assess our debt level and ensure that we continue to use debt responsibly. We have the fiscal capacity to handle higher debt levels and discussions are underway with Finance Canada to raise the limit to provide more flexibility for long term planning.   Fiscal Strategy When it comes to developing our fiscal strategy, our focus is on the future. What we want is the ability to enhance fiscal resources to advance the 22 priorities of this Assembly. First, using today’s current estimates, the Fiscal Strategy provides an initial allocation of $25 million over the life of the 19th Assembly to advance towards our mandate priorities, starting with $10 million in 2020-21. Over the next few weeks we will be working with Members to allocate this funding. Second, we will continue to build on our relationship with the federal government to take advantage of funding opportunities to advance our priorities, such as housing investments. We will also be looking for more flexibility than the usual 75/25 approach to cost-sharing. Third, we will seek opportunities for collaboration with other governments to advance shared priorities. This government does not want to compete for resources with other organizations within the Northwest Territories. We will work with Indigenous Governments across the Northwest Territories to advance projects that benefit all of our people. Finally, we are looking for creative low or no cost initiatives to improve fiscal planning, including four-year business plans, to bring the longer-term horizon into view and will rely on increased program evaluation to bring more value for our dollars spent.The GNWT will undertake strategic reviews to ensure programs and services are meeting expectations and that budgeted expenditures for these programs are properly aligned with our mandate and all additional revenue options are considered. Further, we are seeking an increase to the borrowing limit for better flexibility while maintaining a level of debt that is affordable. We have already begun to engage the federal government and remind them that the NWT is a fiscally responsible jurisdiction, with much opportunity but also long standing gaps. However, we can only succeed in increasing the limit if we demonstrate responsible and strategic spending. Investments will need to be modest and reflect our expected revenue growth over the next four years. From a fiscal perspective, we believe that more effective and sometimes more flexible use of our existing programs and services will provide better value for the public money that we are spending. We expect to improve performance while reducing costs so that we can free up fiscal resources to help close the infrastructure gap that exists across our communities without overreliance on debt.   Tax Measures The cost of living is high in the territory, especially within small communities where average incomes are lower. Budget 2020 introduces no new taxes. We will be reviewing our tax regime in tandem with Standing Committee and we are developing a plan to engage the people of the Northwest Territories in a dialogue about government revenues. Together we will continue to explore ways to increase our own-source revenues without an undue burden on our residents and businesses. The Northwest Territories is at the forefront of climate change, with the impacts of rising average global temperatures being more pronounced here than in other parts of the world, affecting permafrost, ice road seasons, and forest fires. Carbon pricing was developed as a response to the federal proposal and implemented as part of a made-in-the-North approach to encourage greenhouse gas reductions. Effective July 1, federally mandated carbon tax rates will increase to $30 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions as part of our legislated commitment to carbon pricing under the Pan-Canadian Framework. This means a tax rate increase of 2.3 cents per litre on gasoline and 2.7 cents per litre on diesel fuel. In lock step with the carbon tax increase, the Cost of Living Offset will increase to $156 per year for an individual and $180 per year for a child on July 1. The Cost of Living Offset payments are made quarterly, except for single individuals who will receive a lump sum in July because their quarterly payments would be less than $50. Budget 2020 proposes almost $11 million in spending for residents and businesses for the Cost of Living Offset, heating rebates, large emitters’ rebates and grants, and rebates for electricity producers to mitigate the impact on the cost of living due to the carbon tax.   Expenditures Mr. Speaker, we propose to spend $1.896 billion in this Budget. We mapped out the proposed budget starting with the blueprint of last year’s budget. Departments worked hard to find $15 million to reallocate. We also partnered with the federal government for $29 million in new federal funding for some projects. This effort gives us the flexibility to fund $94 million in additional spending. We are investing $39 million of this new spending in our public service to conclude the last collective bargaining agreements. The remainder of the additional funds are proposed to adjust department budgets to better match their spending needs, to deliver on partnership agreements with Canada and to add $6 million in funds for initiatives started in the last Assembly. Based on current fiscal forecasts we will set aside at least $25 million over the term of this government to advance this Assembly’s priorities. The proposed amount for 2020-21 will be submitted through a supplementary appropriation after the Main Estimates have been approved by the Assembly. We will be more collaborative and more strategic in how we approach delivering on our Mandate that comes from this Assembly’s priorities. Providing quality health care and social services that are comparable to what other Canadians receive will always be a key consideration in budget planning. The Department of Health and Social Services has a proposed budget of over half a billion dollars with $18 million of enhancements and adjustments introduced this year. Budget 2020 includes $10 million for supporting well-being through the recently amended Northern Wellness Agreement with the federal government. This means more health and wellness programming in our communities in collaboration with Indigenous Services Canada. With the opening of the Stanton Territorial Hospital last year, we have created a facility that will serve us for many years and will be administered through an agreement with Boreal Health Partners. More functions are becoming operational, and Budget 2020 proposes adding $2.6 million for a wide range of operations in ongoing funding. This funding will support 51 positions to help patients, including 15 behavioural health workers, nine positions in the medicine unit, five staff for processing medical devices, four positions in each of the emergency triage department and day procedures units, and three for rehabilitation services. Through partnership and collaboration with the federal government, we are leveraging our ability to provide health care and this Budget delivers $2.1 million in spending over several areas of health. These include mental health and addictions, home and community care, cannabis awareness, emergency treatment, climate change and health adaptation, improving wellness and aftercare plans for cancer patients and survivors, supporting our participation in the Pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance, and enhanced seasonal flu monitoring. There are infrastructure deficits across all of our communities. Infrastructure includes all of the physical structures needed to support our programs and services. Our hospitals and health facilities care for people to get back on their feet. Our schools provide the space for education received by our students. Our roads allow all residents and businesses the ability to grow our economy by moving goods and labour to where they are in demand, while also allowing ambulances and first responders quick access to emergencies. Transportation links us across this territory through a network of airports and runways of not only concrete but also ice on rivers and lakes. Our laboratories, warehouses, parks, fire monitoring stations and towers, and all other government buildings and assets are ultimately to support the health, safety and well-being of our people. We have a rich, diverse and expansive terrain which creates a challenge for serving our many small communities. The territory continues to lag the rest of Canada in terms of infrastructure with the oldest average age in the country. By investing in the territory, infrastructure has the ability to lower the cost of living and develop the economy at the same time by creating multiple benefits across several sectors and departments to make the Northwest Territories a better place to live and work. The Department of Infrastructure has a proposed budget of $275 million, which includes $10 million of new spending this year. As part of a larger strategy for care, 72 new long-term care beds at the old Stanton hospital will be supported with $4 million of new funding. Proposed spending enhancements of $2.2 million provide for operations of new buildings, including the new Stanton hospital, the Hay River fish plant, biomass heating plants in schools in Hay River and Aklavik, and a laboratory and warehouse in Fort Simpson. Investment in the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway has increased the use of the Dempster Highway, Kilometer 0 to 272 of Highway 8, and Budget 2020 proposes an enhancement of $659,000 for ongoing upkeep to support people seeking adventure in our spectacular North. This Budget introduces a permafrost data management and analytical system for both highways through Transport Canada funding under the Northern Transportation Adaptation Initiative for $390,000. There is a proposed $250,000 to support the Lafferty ferry over the Liard River and Ndulee ferry over the Mackenzie River. Resources from the federal government’s Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund to address climate change will allow us to allocate $2.4 million in the Infrastructure budget, with $300,000 put towards increased funding for the Arctic Energy Alliance and its programs which would bring its total funding to $5.8 million. The remainder will go to approved projects that get underway this year. Given the investment of previous assemblies, a proposed $4.5 million is recommended for the Department of Finance for interest costs related to mainly short-term borrowing, which has advanced our ability to take advantage of cost-shared capital funding offered by the federal government to invest in the territory’s infrastructure with favourable financing. Finance, working with several other departments, is improving the way NWT residents and businesses can access government services through a better and expanded online portal that covers a range of departmental services. Budget 2020 proposes $337,000 to complete the implementation of a single, secure online portal for existing services across various departments and to bring 40 more licences and permits to the platform. The people of the Northwest Territories have a proud history as stewards of the land. We all share a responsibility to ensure our environment is healthy for present and future generations. Budget 2020 introduces additional funding of $8 million for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources within a proposed budget of almost $100 million. In an ongoing effort to establish protected areas, this Budget allocates $175,000 of additional funding to monitor more candidate protected area sites. An additional $2 million is proposed to support our forest fire suppression air tanker fleet to be better prepared for wildfire outbreaks. As part of the environmental assessment of the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway, $45,000 is proposed to fulfill commitments to support the wildlife monitoring program that will expand our understanding of the impact of roads on wildlife and can be applied to future projects. Budget 2020 allocates Environment and Natural Resources with $1.4 million for conservation and recovery of the Bathurst and Bluenose-East barren-ground caribou herds. There is $960,000 to support boreal caribou range planning in Budget 2020 under the Conservation Agreement with the federal government, with $897,000 proposed under Environment and Natural Resources and $63,000 under the Department of Lands. Budget 2020 also recommends $3.5 million in funding for advancing activities under three Challenge Nature Fund Agreements with the federal government, much of which is for the GNWT and indigenous governments to collaboratively establish, manage and monitor Thaidene Nëné and Ts’udé Niliné Tuyeta, which are new territorial protected areas and Dınàgà Wek’èhodì, which is currently a candidate protected area. These four-year agreements, with a total of $11 million in federal funding, will also support the conservation economy and job creation in small communities. Budget 2020 includes $23 million for the Department of Lands for ongoing work to manage, administer and plan for the sustainable use of public land, fairly and transparently, to reflect the interests of our people now and for generations to come. The Department of Justice delivers the Integrated Case Management program. ICM breaks down silos with project collaboration between Health and Social Services, Education, Culture and Employment, Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority staff, the Stanton hospital, and the NWT Housing Corporation. It is an example of government re-imagining existing resources to support better outcomes for people. It empowers them with knowledge and is an innovative solution that delivers results. Most of the people accepted in the program have gone through a life-changing crisis before admission and 70 per cent of them live with mental health challenges. Many program participants are referred to the program to address housing needs, a foundational aspect of the program. More than half of them are experiencing homelessness or precarious housing. Pathfinders are the backbone of the program. They work alongside clients, help navigate systems, and even sit in on appointments between clients and government service providers. The outcomes for participants are tangible, such as secure housing, as well as the intangible, such as the self-confidence it gives participants who gain greater independence once they understand how to effectively access the supports they need. ICM is also tasked with identifying barriers that participants have faced so that departments can collaborate to remove those barriers for all service users. Budget 2020 allocates $827,000 towards ongoing funding to make ICM a permanent program. The participating departments will move forward together to make the best use of the knowledge and experience about accessing government programs that is being gathered through this program. Budget 2020 also proposes $240,000 for the Victim Services Program that directs funds entirely to community-based organizations that provide victim support services. A strong education system for all stages of childhood development is one of the cornerstones on which to build the future of the Northwest Territories. Budget 2020 proposes $340 million in spending for the second largest department, Education, Culture and Employment. Budget 2020 continues to implement the Specialized Territorial Support Team for schools with $319,000 in new funding for mental health and speech and language specialists, bringing the specialist team to five members. This Budget continues to improve the Northern curricula with $129,000 of new funding to support resource development about Northern issues and to create assessment tools for credential recognition of this curricula beyond our borders for students applying for post-secondary opportunities, and also to provide training for our teachers to deliver this material. Budget 2020 also proposes an ongoing funding increase for education authorities of $269,000 for student transportation to catch up with actual expenditures. Another successful and innovative program that is expanding is Northern Distance Learning. Funding of $604,000 is proposed to bring Northern Distance Learning to five more schools and provide access to more students, as well as enhancements and funding for the equipment needed. Northern Distance Learning harnesses technology to improve student learning opportunities across all of our communities with videoconferencing and online tools linked to high schools in regional centres. The program is helping high school students achieve academic success without having to leave their home communities. To support the processing of information requests related to Day School Settlement Records, $129,000 is dedicated to a Student Records Coordinator. This coordinator will help former Day School students get the compensation to which they are entitled under the March 2019 class-action suit settlement with the federal government. The GNWT is dedicated to creating a prosperous and sustainable Northern economy and the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment has a proposed budget of $60 million to that end. Spending proposed in Budget 2020 includes an increase of $758,000. To promote economic growth, Budget 2020 is proposing $250,000 to support implementing socioeconomic agreements that will facilitate mine developments in the Dehcho and Tłı̨chǫ regions. To promote economic diversity and nurture a growing tourism sector, $176,000 is dedicated to support increased activity in the Beaufort-Delta region from Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway traffic and $92,000 is dedicated to improving public safety along the Ingraham Trail for aurora viewing in North Slave parks. The responsibility of Northern governance and decision-making often spans more than one department, and that includes offshore oil and gas negotiations. Budget 2020 puts forth $825,000 to support resource management under the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, with $705,000 allocated to the Department of the Executive and Indigenous Affairs, and $60,000 for each of Environment and Natural Resources and Industry, Tourism and Investment. The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation is proposing a total operating budget of $109.2 million in 2020-21 to support the Corporation’s mandate, which includes $4.2 million of additional spending to promote housing partnerships, homeownership and the preservation of the public housing program. During the term of the 19th Assembly, the NWTHC will continue to work with thirty-three communities toward the development of Community Housing Plans that include local and community-based strategies and solutions to guide the adaptation of existing housing, and the development of future housing in each community. Further, the NWTHC will work with people currently in Public Housing who may have the resources to become homeowners through the New Home Program and through the sale of public housing. We will also address housing affordability through the Canada Housing Benefit, a new national portable housing benefit program designed to address housing affordability. We recognize the need for an increased supply of affordable housing in the territory. To move forward we look to housing partnership programming such as the Community Housing Support Initiative that will support local and Indigenous governments and community partners in developing unique housing approaches. Additional opportunities can be found in the National Housing Co-Investment Fund, with a $60 million allocation for NWT housing projects. Recognizing the great need of people who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness, we are developing the GNWT Homelessness Strategy to ensure that GNWT investments in, and actions on, homelessness are aligned, consistent and effective.   Next Steps Having set a foundation for government operations, I would like to say a few words about our immediate next steps. The next task is to review and analyze how we use this $1.9 billion budget not only to deliver good governance day-to-day but also to advance initiatives in support of the 19th Assembly’s priorities. To do this, we will take a “whole of government” approach and try to avoid pitting one set of needs against another. We must find ways to advance all of our priorities, recognizing that different regions, communities, and people within those communities will have different needs. Recognizing and balancing the many needs of a diverse society is one of the roles of government. It is a challenge but also an opportunity to showcase consensus government by working with all Members of this Assembly. We will also be working on a more consistent approach to evaluate programs and services. All departments will be involved in performance measure development and monitoring to ensure we are getting optimal returns on our investments. We expect that a more systematic approach should help achieve more value from our expenditures and improve evaluation of our service levels. Last, but far from least, we will change the way that the government does business. There will always be risk in the world. Our government recognizes that there are risks around us and challenges ahead. We acknowledge that our economy has slowed, our fiscal resources are limited, and much of our physical and technological infrastructure still needs to catch up to the rest of Canada. National and international conditions are continuously changing. However, having acknowledged those risks and challenges, we believe that changing our approach to how to deliver government services will help us prepare for whatever new challenges the future may bring. We will not be afraid to take risks because risk is where the opportunities arise. We will not be stalled in fear that decisions, proposals, solutions, or new programs may not deliver as hoped. We will have the courage to start taking measured risks with incremental evaluation of our efforts. We will remain engaged with our residents in order to be responsive and proactive. To achieve this goal may require a cultural shift to harness the ingenuity of our public service and our communities. We will build a culture of creativity and innovation within our administration, our public service and, hopefully, across the Northwest Territories. This does not require millions of dollars of new investment, but it will take relationships built on trust, communication and respect. Fortunately, we start in a position of strength given the good work done day in and day out by our public service. This culture shift will also need to start from the top with each of us in Cabinet and in the 19th Assembly leading with integrity and courage and solving problems creatively and collaboratively. My commitment to this Assembly was a commitment to people, building relationships, and understanding the stories of others. I have learned that the budget process is a year-long endeavour and with the shift to four-year business plans it will be important to hear from different perspectives throughout our term. While the message in Budget 2020 is largely one of stability, that is not the message of the 19th Assembly. The message from this Assembly is found in its priorities and we will take measurable actions using a collaborative approach to achieve our Mandate. This Assembly is one that listens to each other and its constituents and will reach out to stakeholders for feedback. We may have differences of opinion, but these conversations are the true strength of our consensus government. Through collaboration, we will achieve more creative problem solving. With more creative problem solving, we can achieve more responsive and effective results. Establishing performance measures helps evaluate the success of our work so that our resources are used effectively. Making this approach the way we do business and govern will show the world that the Northwest Territories is a premier destination to live with a positive economic future, strong educational opportunities for our children, quality health care, a respectful approach to honouring our lands, water and wildlife, and collaborative relationships with Indigenous governments based in our commitment to reconciliation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Total revenues of $2.19 billion are expected in 2020-21, along with total expenditures of $1.98 billion, which include departmental spending, infrastructure contributions, and other items. The 2020-21 surplus is forecast to be $203 million.  Revised estimates project a 2019‑20 deficit of $70 million. Projected surpluses in the medium-term outlook are anticipated to decline to $3 million in 2023‑24.  Budget 2020 proposes a spending increase of $94 million compared to Budget 2019. This includes $61 million for program enhancements, of which $39 million reflects collective bargaining increases for departments and health authorities, and $6 million for the continued implementation of initiatives from the 18th Assembly. Another $40 million in new spending is supported by $29 million of federal transfers. Programs concluding offset new expenditures by $15 million. There are no new taxes in Budget 2020. Some fees and taxes will continue to be indexed to inflation, in keeping with the GNWT’s policy of doing so where practicable. As previously announced, the federal carbon tax will increase to $30 per tonne from $20 on July 1, 2020. Revenue from carbon pricing will continue to be recycled to NWT residents and businesses.   Quote: “Budget 2020 represents the first step in our plan to advance the 22 priorities identified by the 19th Assembly. We see today’s budget as a cautious and optimistic step forward to renew our commitment to program evaluation and better planning so that we can deliver essential programs and services more effectively. We are committed to an approach that ensures we are getting value for money while building relationships with other governments and stakeholders towards a prosperous and sustainable Northwest Territories.” - Caroline Wawzonek, Minister of Finance   Quick Facts: Budget 2020 forecasts an operating surplus of $203 million after a $70 million projected deficit in 2019‑20. Budget 2020 will see $94 million in increased spending compared to Budget 2019: $6 million to fund ongoing measures from the 18th Legislative Assembly; $61 million to enhance or maintain existing programs; $2 million in amortization and $40 million for other spending adjustments, supported by federal transfers and $15 million in savings.  Debt will rise because capital investment is funded from the surplus and borrowing. Debt is expected to exceed the federally imposed borrowing limit of $1.3 billion by 2021-22. The GNWT’s debt level remains affordable.

Each community is accepting a pre-determined number of applicants into the program, and for two years, individuals accepted into the program will have a caregiver who is paid up to four hours each week to help them with tasks around the home and community, such as cleaning, meal preparation, hauling wood, snow removal, running errands, shopping and more.   The pilot program is underway in Behchoko and intake recently finished in Yellowknife, Dettah and N’Dilo. Planning for the communities of Hay River and Tuktoyaktuk continues and rollout will begin this spring.   Quote “This service will provide additional supports to those who need it in our communities. It will support the independence of elderly and disabled residents and build important connections between community supports and health and social services. We look forward to seeing the impact of this pilot over the coming two years, and are pleased to be offering this service to residents of the Norwest Territories.” Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services, GNWT   Quick Facts This service delivery approach will be trialed in five communities of varying sizes This will ensure we gain an understanding of how this approach supports elders and persons with disabilities in communities with different resources. This program is not meant to replace homecare or long-term care. This service option will complement existing programs. Clients can select their caregiver of choice which can be a family member or a friend. Clients can also choose a community caregiver. In both cases, the caregiver needs to be hired by the local community organization.  Caregivers will be paid to deliver support services that help individuals remain independent in their homes such as grocery shopping, snow shoveling, wood cutting, light housekeeping and meal preparation. Care provided by a professionally regulated health care provider is excluded from this service option. These types of services include, nursing care, rehabilitative care such as physiotherapy or occupational therapy, and palliative care. Paid Family/Community Caregivers are not intended to deliver or replace services that are provided by a health and social services professional. Activities of Daily Living, or ADL’s, that are provided by Home Care workers is excluded from this services option. These types of services include: personal care, medication assistance, equipment management, assisting clients with mobility needs, palliative care. The program will be piloted for two years.  Following the completion of the pilot, the program will be reviewed and considered for permanent territory-wide implementation.

857,2020-02-13,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-arctic-inspiration-prize,Government Website,Paulie Chinna: Arctic Inspiration Prize,"Mr. Speaker, today I would like to highlight and celebrate recipients of the 8th Annual Arctic Inspiration Prize – Northern Compass and The Dehcho: River Journeys.  	The 8th Annual Arctic Inspiration Prize Awards Ceremony was held in Ottawa, Ontario on February 5th. At the Ceremony, Northern Compass received the grand prize of $1 million, and The Dehcho: River Journeys project received $370,000. The Arctic Inspiration Prize recognizes and promotes the extraordinary contribution made in the gathering of Arctic knowledge. It is designed to celebrate and bring further awareness to organizations and their plans to implement this knowledge to real world applications, for the benefit of the Canadian Arctic and the Arctic Peoples. I had the honor of presenting Northern Compass with their $1 million dollar prize in Ottawa last week and would like to share with you an overview of their award winning program: Northern Compass is a skilled team of educators, students and community members from across the North.  The team includes representation from a program that has been supported by the GNWT over the years, the Northern Youth Abroad program.  Northern Compass provides northern youth with tailored support and tools that will allow them to overcome the barriers that they may face when transitioning from high school to post-secondary education. 		They aim to: “Dramatically increase achievement amongst Northerners pursuing their education and career goals after high school, enabling them to become full participants in their communities and beyond”. The project motivates youth to graduate high school and make informed decisions about their future. It also provides support and increased access to training and programs that allow northern youth to pursue and achieve their goals.  Thank you to their nominator, The Honourable David Joanasie, Minister of Education, Minister of Culture and Heritage, Minister of Languages, Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.  I would like to congratulate the Team Leaders, Jim Snider, Karen Aglukark, Lois Philipp, Rebecca Bisson who have put in so much time providing accessible and relevant resources with information on funding, housing, budgeting and other areas related to our northern student’s success.  The Dehcho: River Journeys project was also a recipient of an Arctic Inspiration Award.  This project will: Travel on the Mackenzie River, from the Dehcho to the Delta, and will bridge the past and the present, offering a multi-media experience that explores how the past 100 years have transformed the River. Students will collaborate on two short films, one based on archival materials and the other chronicling a modern-day journey on the river with present-day Elders. The Elders will describe and explain the changes they have seen throughout their lives. Through this project, the development of an interactive and educational online experience will allow students to view the films and then use their new-found knowledge to resolve real-life environmental issues that plague the Mackenzie watershed today. Thank you to their nominator, Dr. Frank Tester, Professor at University of British Columbia School of Social Work.  Team Members includes: Dr. Gordon Christie, Alison de Pelham, Brian Jaffray, Terry Jaffray, Martina Norwegian, Brenda Parlee, Daniel Séguin, Sharon Snowshoe. Thank you for your work on this project and congratulations on your achievement.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Simpson: Three Phases and Upcoming Critical Milestones in the Transformation of Aurora College,"Mr. Speaker, this government has been tasked with transforming Aurora College into a polytechnic university. This work, which will span the 18th, 19th, and 20th Legislative Assemblies, is no small task, but I am here to tell you that we are well on our way. The transformation consists of over 200 projects and 2000 individual tasks. In order to be successful, we need to make the right changes, in the right order, and at the right time. To help keep things on track, the transformation is divided into three phases.  Phase 1 is focused on strengthening the foundation of the existing college, and preparing for transformation by ensuring we understand the detailed steps ahead of us. This is the phase we are currently in. Much work has already been completed in this area, much is underway, and there are some exciting and important projects that will be completed before the year is out.  This work will ensure that the College is ready to enter Phase 2, which is where the real transformational change will begin to occur. This will require wide ranging changes to the organizational structure of the College, a return to Board governance, and changes to the Aurora College Act to ensure that governance is truly at arms-length. These changes will allow us to meet and exceed the standards that the College needs to live up to in order to complete the transformation and become recognized as a polytechnic university. This final transformation will occur in Phase 3. Transparency is the key to maintaining confidence and building trust, so in the coming weeks I will deliver three Ministers statements describing each of the phases in detail, so that we can celebrate the successes we have already had, describe next steps, and let everyone know how College staff, Members of the Legislative Assembly, Indigenous governments, and the public will be able to contribute to the decisions that are made moving forward. We cannot do this alone, Mr. Speaker, and we are not going to try to. To keep the public better informed, we will be launching a new interactive web page, and a quarterly report to track progress and celebrate our successes. I will share these reporting tools with my colleagues and the public as they are released.  Mr. Speaker, the transformation to a polytechnic university is a critical step in the economic and social development of the territory. We are not just creating an institution; we are helping create the future of the Northwest Territories. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. "

This year’s theme was chosen in partnership with the NWT Literacy Council as a call to action that focuses on the importance of using Indigenous languages at home, at school, in the media, at work and in the community This year, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is also leading a campaign to recognize bilingual employees who are providing important government services to the public in Indigenous languages. The Bilingual Employees Recognition Initiative profiles some of our valuable public servants online and through the media as a way to celebrate the knowledge they hold and critical services they provide to northerners. Financial support has also been provided to each of the 7 regional Indigenous governments to host Indigenous Language Month events that help to raise the profile of the NWT’s Indigenous languages in communities. Information on Indigenous Languages Month activities in each region can be found by contacting regional Indigenous governments. Quote “Language and culture contribute to a strong sense of identity and pride for northerners. During Indigenous Languages Month, we celebrate the Elders, community leaders, teachers and public servants who are championing language revitalization efforts across the NWT. It’s through this dedication that we will realize our shared vision of a territory where all official languages are supported, respected and thriving.” - R.J.

860,2020-02-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-fostering-indigenous-languages,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Fostering Indigenous Languages,"Mr. Speaker, I stand in this House today to celebrate the nine official Indigenous languages of the Northwest Territories. How incredible that we have nine official Indigenous languages, unlike any other jurisdiction in Canada. Our languages are gifts to be protected, strengthened, valued and promoted.   Mr. Speaker, it is our responsibility to keep our languages alive, to ensure we are a Territory where Indigenous languages are supported, respected, and where they thrive. This is the vision that gives me hope, that gives us the energy and the drive to revitalize our languages, and that will help us ensure that our children and our youth retain a strong connection to their language and to who they are. Mr. Speaker, each of our Indigenous languages: Chipewyan, Tłı̨chǫ, South Slavey, North Slavey, Gwich’in, Cree, Inuvialuktun, Inuuinaqtun and Inuktitut, articulate the ways of knowing, doing, being and believing that are unique to their own communities and history. They define who we are as people of the Northwest Territories.    Indigenous languages are the essence of our identity, our people and our culture. Our Indigenous languages remind us of our relationships with each other, the land and the spiritual world. It is through the oral traditions, legends and stories of our ancestors, Elders, and knowledge keepers that we come to understand the history, geography and ecology of this land. These stories remind us to work together through consensus and collaboration, which is the basis of how we govern here in the Northwest Territories. Our languages benefit all of our residents. Mr. Speaker, I am one of the countless Indigenous people who never acquired the language that was spoken by my ancestors since time immemorial, so I understand the importance of fostering Indigenous languages, and commit this government to do so through the many revitalization initiatives currently in place, and those planned for the future.   Mr. Speaker, February is Indigenous Languages Month in the Northwest Territories, and       I am proud to be a part of a territory that acknowledges and celebrates the diversity of language, and the rich culture of its peoples. The theme of this year’s celebration is Say It With Me. This is a call to action that focuses on the importance of using Indigenous languages at home, at school, in the media, at work and in the community. These are the words of encouragement that the next generation of speakers needs to hear to increase the presence and value of Indigenous languages.  This month, we are supporting regional Indigenous governments to celebrate Indigenous Languages Month through community activities and events. As a government, we are also celebrating the bilingual Government of the Northwest Territories employees who provide important government services to the public in Indigenous languages. Next month, we will continue these celebrations by honouring 14 students graduating from Aurora College with the University of Victoria’s Certificate in Indigenous Language Revitalization.   Mr. Speaker, there are many exciting Indigenous language revitalization initiatives underway right now within the territory, we have: awarded 29 Indigenous Languages Revitalization Scholarships to postsecondary students in programs focused on Indigenous languages, piloted the Northwest Territories Indigenous Languages Mentor-Apprentice Program in partnership with three regional Indigenous governments which is helping 60 community participants build language fluency, delivered training for 20 Community Indigenous Language Instructors to support capacity building and give communities the tools they need to keep the languages vibrant and strong, provided training for over 100 Indigenous language teachers in instructional strategies and resources to use in school programs, and  we will be launching the new JK-12 Our Languages curriculum in our schools beginning in the 2020-2021 school year.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work that we have done to support Indigenous languages. Recently, on an education tour, I saw a wonderful example of this in action when I came across an Indigenous Language scramble game. This game started as a project created by students at Paul William Kaeser High School in Fort Smith who kick started the creation of a Chipewyan Scramble game. This ‘student created’ Indigenous language teaching tool became so popular that the South Slave Divisional Education Council invested in its commercial production, printing copies and distributing them to schools throughout the South Slave. It was not long before other school divisions began asking for copies in other Indigenous languages. In response, the game was redesigned to accommodate additional languages, and hundreds of copies have now been distributed to schools and libraries throughout the North with the hope that children, parents, and grandparents come together to explore their language through a fun and exciting family activity.    Mahsi cho to the Elders, community leaders, language advocates, and teachers who continue to promote Indigenous language revitalization efforts across the Northwest Territories. Mahsi cho to all the language learners who have the courage to Say It With Me in the Indigenous languages of the Northwest Territories. Most importantly, I want to encourage our young leaders and adult learners to take up the torch and become the new champions of Indigenous language revitalization across the Northwest Territories.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
861,2020-02-12,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/diane-thom-strongest-families-institute,Government Website,Diane Thom: Strongest Families Institute,"Mr. Speaker, every year, one in five Canadians experience a mental health challenge or illness. Young people aged 15 to 24 are more likely to experience a mental illness or substance use disorder than any other age group. Research also shows that 70 percent of mental health challenges begin during childhood or adolescence. These numbers are higher in the NWT with the impacts of intergenerational trauma and the legacies of colonization and residential schools. To help address these concerns, the Department of Health and Social Services released the Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Plan in June 2019 to guide changes to our mental wellness and addictions recovery system. A primary goal of the action plan is to ensure services are person and family-centered, recovery-oriented, trauma-informed, accessible, and culturally safe. We want people to experience positive and effective support at any point of entry into the system, and to remain engaged as partners in their care as they move toward healing and recovery in their lives.  As part of developing the action plan, the Department reached out to Northerners and key stakeholders. They made it clear that there was a need for more mental wellness and addictions recovery options and supports. One way to meet this need is to implement distance-based and eMental Health programs across the NWT. Launched in January 2020, Strongest Families Institute is the first of several mental health initiatives that are being implemented to complement in-person supports and options to residents. With our partners Bell Let’s Talk and Northwestel, we will invest $500,000 total over the next five years to have Strongest Families Institute provide telephone-based distance support for individuals and families experiencing mild to moderate anxiety, depression, and behavioural concerns.  Strongest Families Institute provides individuals and families with weekly access to trained coaches and skills-based programming to support their unique needs, experiences and goals. Because it is telephone-based, there are very few barriers. Once referred to the program, people can talk to their coach in the comfort and privacy of their own home at a time that works best for them, day or night.  Mr. Speaker, these award winning, evidence-based programs have been shown to help with child mental health issues, academic progress, bullying, family relationships, and parental stress. Strongest Families Institute has been providing these programs to all the Atlantic Provinces, Manitoba, and Finland for many years. An important focus of the Department of Health and Social Services is to work towards building and supporting a more culturally aware and informed health system. To ensure that the Strongest Families Institute’s programming is culturally respectful, it was co-designed with partners including Indigenous advisors. All of their coaches also receive ongoing diversity training to gain knowledge and support a variety of cultural traditions. Information specific to our Territory’s northern context has also been shared to help inform Strongest Families Institute coach and staff training. Mr. Speaker, Strongest Families Institute is one of many support options that residents can access in the NWT. We are committed to increasing the number and variety of culturally respectful and community-based mental wellness and addictions recovery options. Giving people more choices  in addition to things like the Community Counselling Program, the NWT Help Line, and on-the-land healing, is part of our commitment to building better mental wellness and addictions recovery success in the NWT.  There is no single approach that will work for everyone when it comes to addressing mental health and addictions. By providing a variety of options based on the needs of the person seeking support, we are more able to provide the right type of care, at the right time, by the right person. Going forward, we will continue to work with individuals and families who have first-hand experience with mental wellness and addictions recovery, as well as Indigenous governments, and other key stakeholders as we work to improve our system and better meet the needs of NWT residents. In closing, I want to thank Bell Let’s Talk and Northwestel for partnering with us in supporting mental wellness in our territory. I also want to encourage individuals and families seeking support to reach out to their local Community Counselling Program for more information on the Strongest Families Institute and its potential to provide some valuable support in their lives.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

The Arctic Inspiration Prize recognizes and promotes the contribution made by teams who have dedicated their time to projects that serve the Canadian Arctic, the people and Canada as a whole.   Northern Compass, who has received a $1 million dollar prize, is made of a skilled team comprised of educators, students and community members from across North, including the Executive Director of Northern Youth Abroad – a program that has been jointly supported by the Departments of Education, Culture and Employment and Department of Municipal and Community Affairs over the years.  Northern Compass aims to enable Northern youth to successfully transition from high school to post-secondary education and on to fulfilling careers through pathways relevant to their cultural context. The program model will motivate and encourage youth to graduate high school, make informed decisions about their future, and then provide the support and access necessary to pursue and achieve their goals. The project proposes to serve youth between the ages of 15 and 25, living in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. This is the 2nd nomination for Northern Compass.     Quotes:  “I was happy to be able to present this award to Northern Compass last week in Ottawa. The project was started through Northern Youth Abroad’s network of passionate alumni and staff, with a mission that aligns well the goals of the GNWT. The Department of Municipal and Community Affairs has been a long-time supporter of the Northern Youth Abroad Program and as an extension, a supporter of the Northern Compass program, and I look forward to continuing to see the relationship continue over the years.”  -Paulie Chinna, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs    “One of our challenges in the NWT involves finding ways to support our students, particularly in our smaller communities, as they transition from high school to post-secondary. I am encouraged by the program model put forward by Northern Compass and am confident that they will support our goal of increasing student success across our territory.”  -R.J Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment    “Programs like Northern Compass are essential for the health of Northern youth. As a Northern Youth Abroad facilitator for the past 13 years, I have seen what can happen when our children are given opportunities to participate and learn. They emerge with a sense of pride in their culture and community, develop leadership skills, and are encouraged by the promotion of success in education.  I’d like to congratulate Northern Compass on this achievement and look forward to watching the program prosper.”  -Shane Thompson, Minister Responsible for Youth     Quick Facts: The Arctic Inspiration Prize may be distributed through as many as 10 prizes with a total value of $3 million dollars The Government of the Northwest Territories is a proud contributing partner to the Arctic Inspiration Prize.

864,2020-02-11,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-climate-change-progress-update,Government Website,Shane Thompson:  Climate Change Progress Update,"Mr. Speaker, the Government of the Northwest Territories knows that climate change is an important issue to Northwest Territories residents and all Canadians. That’s why strengthening the government’s leadership and authority on climate change and ensuring climate change impacts are considered when making government decisions are two of the 22 priorities identified by the 19th Legislative Assembly. Climate change affects our environment, our economy and the traditional way of life. Our communities continue to face impacts to their winter roads, shorelines and harvesting practices. A long-term and coordinated response in collaboration with all of our partners is needed to address climate change in the Northwest Territories. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources is proud to lead this work.   The 2030 NWT Climate Change Strategic Framework sets out our government’s long-term plan for addressing climate change. This includes actions in response to the 2017 report of the Auditor General of Canada. The Framework was developed with input from Indigenous governments and organizations, Northwest Territories residents and stakeholders and is a government-wide response to climate change.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report this work is well underway.  Last April, Environment and Natural Resources released the first five-year Climate Change Action Plan under the Framework. 95% of the actions led by the Government of the Northwest Territories are either on track or complete.  As well, in the last year, the Government of the Northwest Territories has: Released a Sustainable Livelihoods Action Plan to support access to country foods and being on the land; Funded a number of projects focused on climate change research, monitoring and adaptation; Worked with our Indigenous partners to establish two new Territorial Protected Areas; and Delivered a course to bring climate change into community decision-making. This is in addition to the Government of the Northwest Territories’ work to implement the NWT 2030 Energy Strategy.  Mr. Speaker, these are important accomplishments the Government of the Northwest Territories and our partners should be proud of.  Still, we know there is more to be done.  That’s why, over the next year, we will continue to work with our partners on the Climate Change Action Plan.  We look forward to releasing our first annual progress report, alongside annual reporting on the 2030 Energy Strategy.  Our government will continue to show leadership on climate change throughout the 19th Legislative Assembly, including the establishment of an NWT Climate Change Council with our Indigenous partners to help guide government actions. Mr. Speaker, relationships are key to advancing this agenda. This means honouring our partnerships with Indigenous governments and organizations and sharing what we know about climate change across Northern and Southern jurisdictions. It also means continuing to advocate for federal funding to address climate change and build strong, resilient communities.  Environment and Natural Resources remains committed to its leadership role on climate change. We will report on our progress and work together with Northerners to ensure our unique way of life can continue in a changing climate. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
865,2020-02-07,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/gnwt-releases-five-year-evaluation-report-education-renewal,Government Website,GNWT releases five-year evaluation report on Education Renewal,"The GNWT Department of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) has released its first five-year evaluation report on the Education Renewal and Innovation (ERI) initiative for junior kindergarten (JK) to grade 12 education in the Northwest Territories (NWT). The 10-year ERI initiative was launched in 2013 to address identified gaps in student achievement and other challenges in the education system. ERI has introduced 45 initiatives focused on student-centered learning, student and educator health and wellness, quality education, the needs of small communities, flexibility in curriculum, assessment and accountability, and partnerships with Indigenous governments and organizations. This evaluation report reviewed 9 of 45 initiatives under the ERI Framework to see how these initiatives are working to improve outcomes for students across the NWT.  Evaluators found encouraging results and early successes in a number of areas. The report recommends continuing a number of promising programs, including Northern Distance Learning, to ensure equitable education in small communities, and Child and Youth Care Counsellors, to continue supporting students’ health and wellness.  The evaluation also identified where additional work is needed to address remaining gaps in student achievement and outcomes, especially for small communities. Key recommendations include prioritizing ERI commitments to focus on schools in small communities, including reviewing the current funding approach and working more closely with Indigenous governments, education leaders and families on present and future initiatives. A full list of recommendations can be found in the Executive Summary. Although distinct from the recent report on education tabled by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), the ERI evaluation report mirrors many of the findings of the audit, indicating that the GNWT has provided a fair analysis of its own systems. The ERI evaluation report has also given the department the opportunity to immediately responding to known challenges within the education system. The results of both the evaluation and audit will inform changes to education renewal and innovation over the next five years to ensure continued improvements to student outcomes in the NWT. Quote: “The first five years of Education Renewal and Innovation have shown promising results in the areas of student achievement and wellness, while providing important insights into remaining gaps and challenges in the NWT education system, especially for our smallest communities. The results of this evaluation will be essential in informing how we continue to work with our education partners, families, leaders and experts to improve experiences and outcomes for students in every community of the Northwest Territories. Education is a way to change the fortunes of the territory but only when we work together.”  - R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment Quick Facts: The Education Renewal and Innovation Framework: Directions for Change was released in 2013 and serves as the roadmap for transforming the NWT education system to improve student experiences and outcomes. The end of the 2018-19 fiscal and school years marked the end of the first five years of the ERI Framework implementation. The ERI evaluation assessed the early implementation and results of the initiative to determine if the department is on track to achieve proposed changes, and to inform amendments moving forward.

The celebration was launched on February 5th and will continue to the 8th.  This event marks the 9th year of the festival celebrating hockey, one of Canada’s national sports. Norman Wells, Dettah and N’Dilo will also play host to visits associated with Hockey Day in Canada, as well as Deline, which is the birthplace of hockey in Canada. The festivities will bring kids’ hockey and officiating clinics, various hockey games, school visits, NHL celebrities and of course the Stanley Cup to Yellowknife. Celebrity participants will be part of the festivities including: television host Ron McLean along with NHL alumni Lanny McDonald, Brian Trottier, Paul Coffey, Wendel Clark, Darcy Tucker and former Women’s National Team member Cassie Campbell-Pascal. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the City of Yellowknife for planning this great event. Thank you to the sponsors for your support of such a great community event. Thank you to all of our honored guests for coming to the North. We hope you are enjoying our world renowned northern hospitality.   I would also like to give a special thank you to all of the volunteers who help make this event happen in all the different venues.  There have been a number of events that are a part of the celebrations; these include: The Music of Hockey with performances by local artists - hosted at the Northern Arts & Cultural Centre this past Wednesday evening; The banquet held last night, which featured  Ron MacLean, an NHL Alumni Hot Stove discussion and the Stanley Cup;  An NHL Declaration of Principles Breakfast hosted by NHL Alumni Andrew Ference this morning; and,  later this evening, the Celebrity and Alumni Classic hockey game.

868,2020-02-07,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/rj-simpson-office-auditor-general-report-education-system,Government Website,R.J. Simpson: Office of the Auditor General Report on Education System,"Check Against Delivery   Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Report of the Office of the Auditor General of Canada was tabled on the audit of Early Childhood and the Kindergarten to Grade 12 education system in the Northwest Territories. The Report focused on five areas: Inclusive schooling; Indigenous language and culture-based education; equitable access to quality education; programming, staff qualifications, and training in licensed early childhood programs; and how these areas worked to support student outcomes.   The tabling of this report is timely, falling at the beginning of a new Legislative Assembly that has made it a priority to increase education outcomes to the same level as the rest of Canada. The recommendations from the Office of the Auditor General align with the areas where we have already begun to make changes, or are planning to invest more resources and improve programming and we have accepted their recommendations.   While we are making some headway and seeing promising results with programs like Northern Distance Learning, small communities remain in need of greater support. One of our highest priorities over the life of this government is to ensure equitable education delivery in all communities across the territory. We will be increasing our efforts to address the achievement gap among small communities and Yellowknife, and between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students to ensure that our education system is on par with the rest of Canada.  Mr. Speaker, later today the Department is holding a technical briefing on the five-year evaluation of the Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 Education Renewal and Innovation Framework.    As with the Auditor General’s report, this evaluation provides us important information on where select programs are working, where they need to improve, and whether they should be restructured to meet the needs of students.  We expect to table our management response in the coming weeks to incorporate the recommendations of the Auditor General and the findings of the Education Renewal and Innovation Evaluation. A renewed Education Renewal Innovation action plan will follow later this year. Mr. Speaker, we all know that education is a cornerstone for a healthy and successful life. However, we can only be successful through the work of many partners, and education is only one of the building blocks.  We will continue to work across departments and with Indigenous governments, parents, students, and with our education and community partners, to ensure we close the gaps to improve student outcomes, and provide youth with our best efforts for the future they deserve. Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
869,2020-02-07,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/caroline-cochrane-development-mandate,Government Website,Caroline Cochrane: Development of the Mandate,"Check Against Delivery Mr. Speaker, later today, I will be tabling the Mandate of the GNWT 2019-2023. The Mandate will guide our actions as a government and serve to hold Cabinet accountable as we work to advance the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly. The Northwest Territories faces unprecedented challenges.  We have been elected in a time of global economic uncertainty, increasingly complex social issues, and multifaceted impacts of climate change. In the face of these challenges, I truly believe that the only way our Assembly can fulfill its promise to the residents of the Northwest Territories is to work together in the true spirit of consensus government. I speak on behalf of all Cabinet Members when I say we are committed to a government that is open, collaborative and cooperative.   The Mandate is built from the priorities we set together as newly elected Members of the 19th Legislative Assembly in October 2019.  It is strengthened by the input and advice we received from the Standing Committee on Accountability and Oversight.     I wish to thank Standing Committee for their willingness to work with us. Our shared commitment to cooperation and collaboration as Members of the 19th Legislative Assembly gives me confidence in what we can achieve over the next four years.       Mr. Speaker, I trust that all Members of this Assembly will see their insights, ideas and suggestions reflected in this Mandate.  I trust residents will see a set of clear and measureable actions needed to make progress within the life of this Assembly, and to hold this Cabinet to account as we work towards achieving our priorities.  I look forward to working together in advancing the Priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly through the implementation of the Mandate. Our Mandate provides a path forward, yet it is not written in stone.  We will encounter the unexpected, and must be able to adjust course as needed. Mr. Speaker, I spoke of challenging times, and the need to work together to actualize our priorities.  Working together cannot be done in the isolation of this house.   We need to make the time to listen to those impacted by our services and to people working on the frontlines of some of our most challenging issues. We all need to work together, Cabinet, Regular Members, Indigenous and community governments, and the federal government. We must remain mindful of each community’s unique challenges and opportunities. We are committed to meaningful, positive change in the way the government does business.  Very soon, this Assembly will debate the Budget and what that means to advancing our priorities. We must bear our overall fiscal situation in mind as we make decisions in the weeks ahead, and we must exercise caution to only commit to actions we have the means to achieve. Mr. Speaker, there will always be more we can do, but we know our needs outweigh our resources. This Cabinet welcomes the insight of Regular Members and looks forward to discussing how we can best apply our limited resources to achieve our priorities.  But now more than ever we need to be realistic in our expectations, creative in our approaches, and focus on making the most of what we have. The 19th Legislative Assembly brings together leadership from across the Northwest Territories, from backgrounds as diverse as our landscape and peoples. We have been called a historic government in terms of our gender balance. We have begun to foster effective dialogue between Cabinet and Regular Members in the spirit of consensus government. We have expressed our desire and willingness to make the changes our people want to see, especially in the area of Indigenous relations, social outcomes and economic outlook.  The 2019-2023 Mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories sets the direction for how we can seize opportunities to make this a pivotal term in the governance of the Northwest Territories.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker."
870,2020-02-06,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/shane-thompson-bathurst-caribou-harvest-and-range-management,Government Website,Shane Thompson: Bathurst Caribou Harvest and Range Management,"Mr. Speaker, caribou are central to our communities, as a food source and as part of the local culture and way of life.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, our caribou herds are struggling. In particular, the Bathurst and Bluenose-East herds have suffered serious declines in recent years. The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to supporting our caribou through this period of decline. Today, I am here to highlight some of the actions the Department of Environment and Natural Resources is leading in our government’s efforts to manage human impacts on the Bathurst caribou herd. Mr. Speaker, five years ago, the Government of the Northwest Territories, together with Indigenous governments and organizations, and the Wek’èezhìi Renewable Resources Board, made the difficult decision to close the Bathurst caribou harvest. As a result of this decision, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources set up a no-harvest zone around the Bathurst caribou, known as the mobile zone. The boundaries of this zone change every week, based on the location of collared caribou. This is how we make sure the caribou are protected. It is illegal to hunt caribou in this zone, Mr. Speaker. Officers monitor the area by ground and by air throughout the winter. We have two check stations at Gordon and McKay Lake that are staffed 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. Local community members also assist Environment and Natural Resources with harvest monitoring. It is important that all hunters going out on the land know where this zone is. Maps with the current mobile zone are posted on Environment and Natural Resource’s website and Facebook page, on the winter roads and in our communities. Mr. Speaker, the people of the Northwest Territories take caribou conservation very seriously. We continue to work with our co-management partners to communicate the importance of this zone for protecting Bathurst caribou. It is up to each and every one of us to do our part to promote this herd’s recovery. Last August, the Government of the Northwest Territories released the Bathurst Caribou Range Plan.  This plan guides decision-makers, developers and communities, to help manage activities on the land in a way that supports the recovery of the Bathurst herd. Our Government is now working to set this plan into motion. This includes sitting down with our Indigenous partners to identify important habitat for Bathurst caribou, such as key land and water crossings and areas of unburned forest.  I am also pleased to report on our efforts to expand on-the-land programs to monitor Bathurst caribou. Last month a workshop with Indigenous groups from across the range of the Bathurst herd was held to further develop a Bathurst Caribou Guardianship Initiative, which included representatives from Nunavut. The workshop brought in members of the Hamayas (ha-MY-us) Stewardship Network from the Queen Charlotte Islands to share their knowledge and experiences as Guardians on their traditional lands. Mr. Speaker, traditional knowledge tells us caribou have always experienced periods of highs and lows. The current population estimate for the Bathurst herd is the lowest it has ever been, that we know of.  It is up to all of us to support our caribou herds through this current low, towards recovery. ENR has heard from communities and wildlife co-management partners that all management actions need to be considered including wolf management.  Environment and Natural Resources and the Tłı̨chǫ Government developed a Wolf Management Proposal based on the best available traditional, local and scientific knowledge.  It includes management actions for wolves on the winter range of the Bathurst and Bluenose-East herds as a way to promote the recovery of these barren-ground caribou herds and support the traditional economy. The next population survey for Bathurst caribou is just a few months away, in June, and results will be available in the late fall. Together with local and traditional knowledge, these survey results will inform our actions going forward, to manage and protect barren-ground caribou.  By applying the best available knowledge together with our co-management partners, we can help support healthy caribou populations for future generations of Northerners. Thank you, Mr. Speaker"

Thom: Opening Address - 2nd Session of the 19th Legislative Assembly,"Check Against Delivery.  Please be seated.      Happy New Year everyone!  I am once again honoured to welcome you all back.  I trust you all had a wonderful festive season with your loved ones.   As we enter a new decade, we begin our work for the people of the Northwest Territories.  Your work can be challenging, but working together as a team will ensure you make the best decisions.  I wish you a productive session with good outcomes and personal balance with life and work for each of you. I am very pleased to be opening this Session of Canada’s first and only gender-balanced Legislative Assembly, led by Canada’s only sitting female Premier.  This may also be one of the youngest Legislative Assemblies to have been elected in the Northwest Territories in recent memory. And it is the second Assembly in a row to have more first-time Members than returning Members.  It is clear in looking around this room that the people of the Northwest Territories voted for change during the last election.    The Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to delivering the change that our people have called for, as well as ensuring their voices are heard throughout the life of this government.  During this Session, the Government will be tabling its 2019-2023 mandate. This document will present the Government’s plan for advancing the priorities agreed to by all Members of the Legislative Assembly.  Our plan puts people first and recognizes that government succeeds when we support the success of every person in the territory. It is a holistic plan that takes into account the physical, social, wellness, and employment needs of residents.  We know that people need a strong and secure foundation on which to grow, beginning with the basics of food, shelter and health.  To address the need for shelter, we will work with stakeholders to increase the number of quality, energy-efficient and affordable housing units and put a stronger focus on community home ownership opportunities. We will support seniors to stay in their homes and communities, by providing increased access to housing programs, increasing the Home Heating Subsidy, and establishing a Community Grant Program for senior supports.  We will also take action to protect seniors from abuse or neglect, and create a separate income assistance program tailored to seniors and persons with disabilities.  We will increase food security by implementing regulatory and program changes to support locally produced and marketed foods. We will work with indigenous and community governments to support community greenhouses, gardens and country food harvesting.  As well, we will work with applicable governments to define community solutions to the Nutrition North Program. To improve the health of NWT residents, we will work with our employees and partners to strengthen our health care recruitment strategy and implement comprehensive labour force planning.  We will also work with communities to increase the availability of e-health, traditional, on-the-land, and other proven approaches to mental wellness and addictions recovery.  We will improve wellness supports including increasing peer support programming, providing transitional housing for those returning from addiction treatment, and establishing medical detox and managed alcohol programming.  We will also strengthen community counselling services by providing standardized screening and assessment tools, improving employee training opportunities, and reducing wait times for accessing counselling.  As well as taking care of basic needs we need to support residents, businesses, Indigenous and community governments so they have the tools to succeed.  To increase early childhood development, we will ensure better coordination of services, and streamline funding to support community-based parenting and early childhood development programming.  We will develop a 10-year Universal Childcare Strategy, and increase child care spaces by providing non-government organizations with retrofit funding, amend policies to allow licensed childcare in public housing, and better utilize our own government infrastructure for early childhood program space.  An increase in childcare space will require more workers, so we will increase support for NWT students who wish to pursue qualified childcare programming. We will support educational success by modernizing the Education Act and education funding framework.  We will ensure distance learning is available in all small communities and pilot a Classroom Assistant training program. We will implement programming to assist schools and parents make decisions together about student placements and social passing, and we will continue to transform Aurora College into an accredited and independent polytechnic university. Our government also recognizes that people want and deserve to have employment opportunities. Good jobs and meaningful work provides people with both the means to support themselves and their families, as well as a sense of accomplishment and pride.  We will increase economic diversification and employment in small communities by developing regional economic development plans, increasing the number of journeypersons and apprentices in small communities, advancing the knowledge economy, and expanding tourism throughout the NWT. As well, we will change policies to allow licenced home businesses in public housing units, mentor entrepreneurs and support community-led maker-spaces.  This government will support local businesses and encourage entrepreneurship by reducing red tape and regulatory burdens. We will also ensure that more benefits from government spending stay in the north by strengthening our procurement policies like the Business Incentive Policy, Northern Manufactured Products Policy, and our approach to Public-Private Partnerships.  We will promote local competition by increasing awareness of GNWT contracting opportunities, actively encouraging NWT businesses to apply for BIP status, and developing a one-stop shop for vendors online.  As well, we will take action to improve the environment for resource development – which is still the biggest sector of the NWT economy – and make sure NWT residents are benefiting from it as much as they can.  We will do this by collaborating with Indigenous governments to develop and implement regional mineral strategies, increase resource exploration and development, increase funding for mining incentive programs and look for new ways to support advanced projects.   As well, we will assess the feasibility of local gas supply projects and the export of liquefied natural gas. To ensure NWT residents enjoy a fair share of the benefits of development, we will a conduct an independent comparison review of our royalty and taxation regimes and socio-economic agreements.  We will meet annually with senior officials of NWT mines to review the results and utilize the recommendations in future agreements.  We also understand people need a sense of belonging and the stability of strong, affordable communities and a clean environment to thrive.  That is why our government will respect and strengthen the ability of communities and regions to make their own decisions, based on their own needs and priorities, including empowering our own regional staff.  We will settle treaty, land, resources and self-government agreements by working with facilitators and engaging directly on a leader-to-leader basis.  We will establish a Special Joint Committee on Indigenous Reconciliation between Cabinet and Regular Members of the Legislative Assembly and review the principles and interests that inform our negotiating mandates. With Indigenous governments, we will also create an action plan that identifies changes required in GNWT legislation and policies to best reflect the principles set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.  This Government will also take steps to increase the resiliency of communities, support their capacity, and help make them affordable places to live.  We will do this by reducing the municipal funding gap, refining our funding models, exploring opportunities for community governments to raise additional revenue, and reducing or stabilizing the cost of delivering core programs and services.  Reducing the cost of power remains a priority, as does reducing our reliance on diesel for generating community power. We know that in many cases moving to greener energy costs the system more money, not less when we have to keep diesel as a backup. We will look to long term solutions including connecting more communities to existing hydro systems.  We will also work with partners and stakeholders to target energy conservation and efficiency programs for small and remote communities where the costs of energy are highest and the need is greatest.  As well, we will create a stronger and more affordable territory through strategic infrastructure investments that connect communities, expand the economy and reduce the cost of living. This will include advancing projects like the Mackenzie Valley Highway, the Slave Geological Province Corridor and Taltson Hydro Expansion. We will also invest in fast and reliable broadband Internet services for communities and modernize our airport infrastructure.  Finally, because the land is the life and the source of wellbeing and security for NWT residents, our government will do more to ensure that our environment is conserved and protected and we will ensure climate change impacts are considered when making government decisions.  We will also establish a Northwest Territories Climate Change Council, bringing together our government with Indigenous and community governments, MLAs and other partners to strengthen our leadership and authority on climate change. This is an ambitious agenda aimed at responding to the needs of people and making sure all residents are able to succeed and thrive. We know it will take more than four years to reach some of our goals, but we are committed to beginning the work now and encouraging future governments to continue it.  During this session, the Government of the Northwest Territories will also be introducing the following bills for consideration by the House: Appropriation Act (Operations Expenditures), 2020-2021; Supplementary Appropriation Act (Infrastructure Expenditures), No. 3, 2019-2020;  Supplementary Appropriation Act (Operations Expenditures), No. 4, 2019-2020; and Supplementary Appropriation Act (Infrastructure Expenditures), No. 1, 2020-2021. The government considers these bills essential to the good conduct of government business and as such, I recommend their passage. As your Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, I now declare open the Second Session of the 19th Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories.   Thank you, Merci Beaucoup, Mahsi Cho, Quanani, Koana.  "

I would like to assure residents that at this time the risk of contracting this virus is low in the NWT.  Since the coronavirus was first reported in the Hubei Province of China, our Government and the Federal Government have moved quickly to ensure we are prepared. Our public health and emergency preparations are well underway and we will continue to monitor the situation as it develops. I would like to fill Members in on the preparations that we’ve undertaken as I know that the anxiety level about this outbreak has increased in our communities. Our Chief Public Health Officer is providing leadership to health emergency planners and senior management within the Health and Social Services system to ensure our communities and frontline staff are ready should the coronavirus be suspected or confirmed in the NWT. The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer and health emergency officials are constantly in touch with their Federal, Provincial and Territorial counterparts to ensure the sharing of timely and accurate information. I am sure Members and residents are curious as to what specific preparations we have completed to date, and if we are prepared to handle possible cases in the NWT. It is important to remind everyone that we’ve been here before. We have learned a great deal from the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, known as SARS, and the ongoing surveillance of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, known as MERS. Similar to the current outbreak, these events required international coordination and response as well as preparations here within the NWT. As with these other events, there is no vaccine; instead, the approach is to prevent the spread of the coronavirus using best practices in public health.     This is vital in order to rapidly identify people who might be sick and apply appropriate precautions in health care settings and communities. Our Chief Public Health Officer and her office is participating in daily briefings with her Federal, Provincial and Territorial counterparts to get the latest information to inform clinical information for frontline staff.  Internal alerts are sent to frontline staff to ensure their personal protective equipment is ready, testing protocols are defined, necessary infection control measures are being practiced, and health facilities are ready to respond in the event that a person in NWT develops symptoms concerning for novel coronavirus infection. We also have a responsibility to communicate to our residents, Indigenous and community governments, schools, tourist operators, day cares and businesses. Mr. Speaker, these stakeholders were provided the most current information on hand along with public education materials for them to share with their stakeholders. As this situation is rapidly evolving, we are committed to providing the most current information through the Department of Health and Social Services website.  We have also started a general communication campaign through social media and traditional media including newspapers and radio ads to raise awareness about the virus. This includes preventive steps residents can take to protect themselves and their loved ones. The advice will sound very familiar as it is similar to what we recommend for the flu, such as staying home if sick and contacting your local public health unit or health centre if you have symptoms of concern. Also, the importance of regular hand-washing, the use of hand sanitizers and healthy respiratory practices can not be emphasized enough, especially since we have other infectious diseases circulating in our communities including the flu and whooping cough or pertussis.  These practices will help reduce the spread of all these illnesses.  Travellers from places of known activity of this coronavirus – particularly the Hubai Province of China – are being provided information at their international points of entry into Canada to self-monitor. We also know that NWT residents travel internationally for both business and pleasure. It is important that residents pay special attention to travel advisories issued by the Federal Government. This information is routinely updated on the Government of Canada’s website under Travel Advice and Advisories. This link is found on our Department’s website including direct reference on our coronavirus section. Mr. Speaker, as this situation evolves our thoughts are with China as they continue to take extraordinary efforts to contain this epidemic. Our thoughts are also with Canadian individuals and families who have been impacted by these events directly or indirectly. The NWT will continue to monitor and assess this dynamic situation, and be a part of national actions to ensure we are prepared as a healthcare system and as a government.   Thank You, Mr. Speaker."

I would also like to take a moment and extend regrets from the Premier of the Northwest Territories, Caroline Cochrane for not being able to join us this evening.  She had planned to welcome everyone this evening and I know she was looking forward to speaking with many of you – but was unfortunately called back unexpectedly and had to return home this evening.  It has been a busy few days here in Vancouver, and though the Premier was called away, she was able to lead some important conversations this week in meetings that Minister Thompson and myself have joined her in, as well as participated in some important announcements that I will touch on shortly – and for that I know she is grateful.  As many of you know, coming to Roundup is important for our government and as the new Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment and Minister of Infrastructure – it was especially important for me. Coming this year as the Minister responsible for this important sector – it was essential for me that as many opportunities as possible were seized to formally introduce myself to the members of the industry, meet with some of our partners, and most importantly, hear directly from exploration companies who are already doing business in the North to find out how we, as a government, can better support them.  I think I bring a unique perspective to the table and one that I am hoping can be leveraged as our government works to increase the resource development sector in the North. I am, as I like to call it, a boots-on-the-ground Engineer by trade and have first-hand experience about what it’s like to do business in the North. I have been on the other side of the table - working with partners and the government, applying for permits, trying to navigate the procurement process and much more. I also understanding firsthand the importance of making sure mining in the North is done safely, having worked on the Giant Mine project for a number of years. I understand that the NWT has some challenges, but because of my experiences, I have some ideas about ways they can be improved – starting first with strengthening our partnerships and continuing to facilitate the relationships between Indigenous and public governments and industry.  This will be key in progressing this sector in a safe and sustainable way. Our partners are one of our greatest assets in the North and I want to take a moment to highlight and celebrate some of the partnerships that, I believe, are leading to new opportunities in our mining industry. First, I’d like to recognize the leadership of Cheetah Resources, Det’on Cho Corporation, and the Yellowknives Dene. Their contract, to begin Canada’s first rare earth project, with the first Indigenous-led mine site, could be a game changer - not just for our territory, but our country. I also want to congratulate the Gwich’in Tribal Council and Inuvialuit Regional Corporation for the release of their regional mining strategies earlier today.   These strategies will serve as roadmaps for industry looking to explore, and action plans for Indigenous governments as they seek to attract investment on their terms. And finally I’d like to highlight the partnerships we have our neighbouring territories and Canada.  On Sunday, the Premier participated in an announcement for the Invest Canada North Initiative.  A brand new partnership - backed by the Government Canada and supported by Canada’s three territorial governments and the industry representatives that make up the North’s mining and exploration sector.  These kinds of partnerships are leading the way back to prosperity in our territory.  That’s really the purpose of coming out in force to events like these: to build relationships and seek out new partnerships which will benefit our territory. Collaboration will improve our collective fortunes.  I want to close my remarks tonight by reiterating what many of you already know – that this is an exciting time for the North.  For the first time ever, we have a gender-balanced Assembly governing our work, and the only female Premier in Canada. Other female leaders such as the City of Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty and Grand Chief Bobbi-Jo Greenland who I believe are both here tonight, are also contributing to the excitement of the North and the batch of strong females we have leading the way for the next generation. We’re also going to start to see some of our transformative projects take shape – which is something to look forward to. The Slave Geological Province, Mackenzie Valley Highway and Taltson Hydro Expansion are projects that will connect our communities, green our economy and support exploration companies as they look to the North to do business and access our rich mineral deposits in a way that is environmentally sustainable.  I am excited for the future of the NWT and proud to be standing here today in this role as Minister of ITI and Infrastructure, but also as part of a government that is committed to working together, hearing concerns and then trying to solve the problems based on all the information collected.  I hope many of you will be part of our future and I’d like to you for being here this evening. I look forward to meeting and speaking with as many of you as possible tonight, and in the future. "

The release of the strategies was welcomed this morning at the AME Roundup – an event at which Northwest Territories Indigenous governments and organizations have been playing a growing and significant role.  The regional strategies, developed with funding from the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment under the Mineral Development Strategy, were formally unveiled by GTC Grand Chief/President Bobbie Jo Greenland-Morgan and IRC Chair and CEO Duane Ningaqsiq Smith. Each strategy outlines existing geological data, maps and information, a comprehensive history of the areas and an outline of local organizations, groups and authorities. A goal of regional mineral development strategies is to provide a clear vision and direction for mineral explorers, investors and others in the industry to guide comprehensive, respectful and sustainable mining practices.   Quote: “These strategies are integral to our work to attract investment in the Northwest Territories mineral industry. Our partnership with Indigenous Governments continues to grow through our joint presence at events such as AME Roundup and the release of regional mineral development strategies. We are at the table together, and investors have a clear picture of that.”   Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment “The Gwich’in must control what happens on our lands – we want to be true partners in any projects undertaken, from concept to close out. The strategy was developed with the input of leadership and people in the Gwich’in communities. We hope this will lead to strong partnerships and economic opportunities that can benefit both the Gwich’in and the Northwest Territories.” Bobbie Jo Greenland-Morgan, Grand Chief/President, Gwich’in Tribal Council “With the production of the draft Roadmap to Mineral Exploration and Development in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC) outlines its priorities to support responsible mineral development in the Region. IRC continues to work in partnership with the Government of the Northwest Territories and Government of Canada to promote potential opportunities in mineral exploration in the North. "" IRC Chair and CEO Duane Smith   Quick Facts: Mining and exploration regularly directly contributes more than 20% of total economic activity annually in the Northwest Territories.

Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge that we are on the traditional territory of the Musqueam, Squamish, and  Tsleil-Waututht First Nations. It’s a pleasure to be here today among partners from the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation and Gwich’in Tribal Council to celebrate a milestone for our local minerals industry.  The launch of regional mineral strategies is a vision the Government of the Northwest Territories had in Mineral Development Strategies. It identified the need to build capacity in our territory’s Indigenous communities – not just in the Beaufort Delta, but right across the NWT. Together, our government worked with the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation and the Gwich’in Tribal Council to develop regional strategies that will encourage, guide, and support mineral exploration and development specific to their regions.   Today, with the release of these documents, we are formally recognizing the completion of our planning – and looking forward to the next step – investment and exploration.    The strategies offer roadmaps for companies looking to do business in the traditional territories of the Inuvialuit and Gwich’in and outline what the leadership in these regions will do to make their traditional territories attractive to responsible developers.  It is appropriate that we highlight these documents here at Roundup because this annual event has been significant in building the capacity that will allow indigenous governments and organizations to participate at the next level - as leaders, funders and even owners of mining projects.  We are at the table together, and investors have a clear picture of that.   I would like to recognize each of you here today as representatives of Indigenous governments and organizations - and to thank you for your participation and support. Collectively – we’re getting the job done and turning our mineral potential into local benefits.  Awareness and recognition for the NWT’s resource potential is growing – as is the respect for our Indigenous governments and the role that they play.   The underlying message that unites these two documents is this:  Indigenous governments and organizations of the Northwest Territories want to see a balanced and responsible approach to the management of our economy and our environment – and they want to be meaningful and equal partners and participants in the development of our North.   By working through Indigenous government development corporations — and with NWT mines — the NWT has developed successful business models and a foundation from which we are ready to take the next step.The Northwest Territories is a region rich in resources and people. We have the tools needed for success and social buy-in. If you’re looking to invest, this is where you should be looking. Thank you again for being here and congratulations to the IRC and GTC and everyone else who made this happen.    "

I’m excited to be here today for this event and in Vancouver for Roundup, with our partners like Cheetah Resources and Nahanni Det’on Cho.  As many of you now, the NWT was built on mining.  But mining is not just our history. It’s our future and today, we celebrate an exciting new chapter.  The signing of this agreement today is a demonstration that NWT resources, outside of our diamonds, are getting international attention — an indicator that we’re rounding the corner and on the road to progress in our mining industry once again.  This story is about jobs and business opportunities. It’s about the diversification of our mineral development sector, and indigenous partnership in our mining sector.  It’s also a story about our country’s reliable access to these vital resources as our economy reaches a crossroad. With the move towards lower-carbon, tech-intensive economies, Canada – thanks to the Northwest Territories and the partners here today - is in a position to build the domestic supply-chain which has– to date - eluded our country and our allies.    Today’s announcement is notable for another reason.  This contract marks a step forward in our territory’s push for Indigenous resource leadership. I want to congratulate the Yellowknives’ Det’on Cho Corporation for characteristically taking the lead on a big idea.  And I would like to commend Cheetah Resources for their commitment to placing Indigenous peoples at this project’s core.   It is a tangible example of the sustainable development and social responsibility that we talk about so often in the Northwest Territories in-line with our territory’s priorities and values. I don’t want to take up much more time as today is about our partners, but I did want to share a thought.  It has always struck me that the Northwest Territories is a land of many “firsts” and “onlys.”  We’re home to the first Canadian diamonds; the only gender-balanced Assembly ever elected and currently the only female Premier. So it is fitting that this chapter in our mining future begins with this story of firsts: Canada’s first rare earths mine and the first Indigenous government poised to lead a mine site in our country.  Our government looks forward to seeing this partnership unfold and the benefits that will follow.  Congratulations for this milestone and thank you to everyone for being here. "

I am happy to be here with each of you for this announcement, and thank you for your efforts to put together this event this morning.  You’ve already heard people talk about the details of this announcement so I won’t get in to that, but what I will say is that progress on projects in the North – that will benefit all Canadians – would not be possible without partnerships and funding commitments like this. The North is rich in resource potential – including minerals that will fuel the global green economy and support climate change efforts. Mining and exploration is also the biggest source of private sector jobs and income for our residents and we are committed to doing our part to support the health of the sector.  Invest Canada North will help us build a strong case in the global marketplace and set the stage for responsible investments in our future. The North has all the ingredients for investor success, but we need to ensure that message is being heard.  It is fitting that this announcement is being made as we get ready for a few days of busy meetings during Roundup. As with my Northern colleagues, attendance at Roundup is important for our government.  The 19th Legislative Assembly has identified increasing resource exploration and development in the NWT as a priority for our government. Being in Vancouver this week will no doubt lead to some beneficial discussions with industry, provide opportunities to highlight the important role partnerships with Indigenous governments and communities are and of course, is a chance to reaffirm awareness across industry of our governments political support for and commitment to this sector. I look forward to seeing how this initiative progresses over the next few years and the role that the Government of the Northwest Territories will play to support its successes.  Thank you. "
886,2020-01-17,Canada,Northwest Territories,,https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/geological-map-updated-mineral-rich-slave-geological-province,Government Website,Geological Map Updated for the Mineral-Rich Slave Geological Province,"An updated bedrock geology map and database will aid explorers and academic researchers investigating the mineral-rich Slave Geological Province.   The updated map, resulting from several years of data collection and analysis, has been published by the Northwest Territories Geological Survey (NTGS) in partnership with the Canada-Nunavut Geoscience Office. Dr. Mike Stubley, a former Government of Northwest Territories employee and highly-experienced geologist, led the work.  The updated map is based on Dr. Stubley’s original map published by the NTGS in 2005. Underlying eastern Northwest Territories and western Nunavut, the Slave Geological Province is well known for its excellent mineral potential and long and prosperous history of mining. Among other geological elements, the updated map contains improved information on rock types favorable for mineral exploration and the location of known kimberlite bodies. Kimberlite is a rare and unique rock type, and some kimberlite bodies contain diamonds. The significance of the project extends beyond mineral exploration and academic research. The updated map has already been used in assessing potential routes for the proposed Slave Geological Province all-season road.  The NTGS is a science-mandated division of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment. The research conducted by the division enables government, residents and investors to make informed decisions and advance the knowledge economy.   Quote: “The Slave Geological Province is an economic breadbasket for the Northwest Territories. Mining and exploration regularly contribute more than 20% of total economic activity in the territory, and the vast majority of that takes place in the mineral-rich Slave Province. With renewed data, industry and academics alike can work to better understand the geology and mineral potential of this region and advance the territory’s economy.”   Katrina Nokleby, Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment Quick Facts: The NWT’s three active diamond mines (Ekati, Diavik and Gahcho Kue) are all located within the Slave Geological Province.  Data for the updated map was contributed by a number of companies including Diamondex Resources Ltd., Strongbow Exploration Inc., GGL Diamond Corp., Kennady Diamonds, Aurora Geosciences, TMAC Resources, MMG Resources, BNT Gold Resources, North Arrow Minerals, and Miramar Mining Corp.
