The statement of defence, filed today in the Court of Queen’s Bench, outlines that government implemented a new physician funding framework only after engaging in good faith, meaningful negotiations and consultation.  

“Alberta’s economy has been devastated over the past five years and our budget has faced shortfalls as a result. Our goal throughout negotiations was to simply hold the line on cost overruns while maintaining spending at the highest level ever. Alberta’s negotiators worked hard and in good faith to arrive at an acceptable agreement that would still ensure that Alberta’s doctors would be the highest-paid physicians in all of Canada. We believe this claim is groundless and we look forward to a timely resolution.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The statement of defence makes clear the following facts:

The AMA was not prepared for negotiations and did not table any proposals until well into the process.
Alberta Health responded to each proposal once they were presented and offered amendments to accommodate the AMA’s interests.
Following mediation, the parties agreed that negotiations were at an impasse.
Government chose to use the clause in the agreement that allowed for the agreement to be ended by either party.
The AMA agreed to include this clause in the agreement and was fully aware of government’s ability to exercise it.
Physicians are not employees of the ministry.

Seniors and Housing Minister Josephine Pon welcomed the panel to its first meeting. Panel Chair Mickey Amery, MLA for Calgary-Cross, will lead the 10-member panel that will provide recommendations to transform Alberta’s affordable housing system.

Seniors and Housing Minister Josephine Pon has appointed 10 experts to an independent panel, led by MLA Mickey Amery, to conduct a review that will provide recommendations to transform affordable housing. Through this review, the panel will identify ways to make the affordable housing system better serve Albertans in need as well as make more efficient use of taxpayer dollars.

“Our government knows Alberta’s affordable housing system must be financially sustainable and able to address growing demand. This review is the foundational piece of our housing transformation work. I thank the panel members for agreeing to spend their valuable time and effort to make housing more affordable and accessible. Their recommendations will help inform a new vision for affordable housing in Alberta.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“It is an honour to chair the Affordable Housing Review Panel and have the opportunity to work with this outstanding group of experts. Over the coming months, as we hear from diverse groups and dig into research, we will be challenged to think creatively about ways government can better provide housing for Albertans in need. We have much work ahead and I am eager to get started.”
Mickey Amery, chair, Affordable Housing Review Panel, and MLA for Calgary-Cross

Panel members bring a diverse range of expertise and backgrounds as housing providers, developers and civil society organizations to identify innovative solutions for Albertans in need of housing. The panel will also receive submissions on populations most in need of affordable housing.
Specifically, the panel will consider:

The role the Government of Alberta plays in providing affordable housing.
Simplifying or easing regulatory structures that create costs and red tape for housing providers.
Gaps in the current affordable housing system.
Innovative approaches that will enable government and its partners to meet increasing demand for affordable housing.

The Affordable Housing Review Panel members are:

Mickey Amery, chair – MLA for Calgary-Cross
Paul Boskovich – president, Genstar Development Company
Lauren Ingalls – chief administrative officer, Westwinds Communities
Jeffrey Johnson – consultant and former Alberta MLA and cabinet minister
Sam Kolias – co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer, Boardwalk REIT
Javaid (Jerry) Naqvi – chairman and founder, Cameron Development Corporation
Marcia Nelson – executive fellow, University of Calgary
Raymond Swonek – chief executive officer, GEF Seniors Housing
Dr. Sasha Tsenkova – professor, University of Calgary
Rachelle Venne – chief executive officer, Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women

To ensure physical distancing, members will rely on virtual technology to facilitate meetings, presentations and engagement, where possible. The panel will hear from groups that are interested in affordable housing. These groups include seniors, Indigenous Peoples, newcomers, people experiencing homelessness, and people with disabilities.

“I feel privileged to help shape the future of the province’s affordable housing system in order to sustain this critical resource. In this economic juncture, housing is more important than ever. I applaud the province for taking steps to review a program that has been evolving since 1958 to ensure it supports housing needs of vulnerable families, seniors and individuals with special needs, while supporting growing demands for innovative housing solutions.”
Lauren Ingalls, chief administrative officer, Westwinds Communities


“Affordable housing is essential for competitive and resilient communities. During the current pandemic, it shelters Albertans from economic shocks, provides a place to work, learn and recover from social stress. The ecosystem of affordable housing providers requires resources, commitment and innovative strategies to address growing housing challenges.”
Dr. Sasha Tsenkova, professor, University of Calgary


“Affordable housing is critical to building safe, inclusive Alberta communities. Housing has been documented often as a critical component to improving the lives of Indigenous women, most recently in the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. I look forward to participating in the Affordable Housing Review Panel with this view in mind.”
Rachelle Venne, chief executive officer, Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women


“On behalf of Cameron Corporation, I am proud to be selected by Minister Pon to be part of the Affordable Housing Review Panel. From our perspective as an immigrant family and an Edmonton-based developer for 40 years, we understand the need to build a community everyone can enjoy, and one in which we all feel accepted. I look forward to working hard alongside my fellow panel members and partner organizations to continue making Alberta accessible for all.”
Jerry Naqvi, chairman and founder, Cameron Development Corporation

The panel’s final report will be submitted to Minister Pon by Sept. 30.
Quick facts

Currently, more than 110,000 Albertans live in affordable housing.
Almost a half-million Albertans spend more than 30 per cent of their household income on rent, which is the standard for affordability.
More than 19,000 households are currently on waiting lists for affordable housing.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The district heating and cooling centre is located in the iconic University Hall building, which first opened in 1971. An upgraded district heating and cooling centre is critical to the continued operation and viability of the vast majority of the current campus. Student residences, academic spaces and research labs will all benefit from a more efficient and functional system. It will also give dozens of Albertans consistent, well-paying jobs – a key government priority under Alberta’s Recovery Plan.
Funding for the University of Lethbridge project is part of an additional $98-million commitment to post-secondary institutions for accelerated capital maintenance and renewal, which is expected to create about 533 full-time jobs around the province.

“The University of Lethbridge is one of the top research universities of its kind, and it’s also a strong pillar of the regional economy. This funding will not only guarantee a high-quality campus experience for years to come, it will also help many Albertans in the Lethbridge area find gainful employment and provide for their families.”
Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education


“Alberta’s Recovery Plan focuses on infrastructure as a critical component for supporting economic growth and jobs for Albertans. This includes investing in shovel-ready projects to upgrade and maintain public facilities, like this post-secondary institution, that help keep Albertans working and stimulate local economies where it matters most.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure


“Our government is working to make smart and responsible investments. This new capital maintenance funding for the University of Lethbridge – funding that has been deferred for over a decade – is a welcome influx of capital to Lethbridge. This is spending that will benefit students, help control the cost of future maintenance to the university, and will also help the community by ensuring that well-calculated and focused projects are creating jobs right here in Lethbridge.”
Nathan Neudorf, MLA for Lethbridge-East


""The investment in a new energy centre at the University of Lethbridge not only creates immediate employment, but will lower our carbon footprint and provide ongoing operational savings through energy efficiency. This new plant and supporting infrastructure will reliably meet the heating and cooling requirements for approximately 80 per cent of our campus buildings.""
Mike Mahon, president and vice-chancellor, University of Lethbridge

Budget 2020 already includes $118.5 million for capital maintenance and renewal at colleges, universities and polytechnics. In April, the Alberta government announced it was accelerating the capital plan and increasing capital maintenance and renewal spending in 2020-21 to almost $2 billion. Advanced Education worked with post-secondary institutions to identify projects, with a focus on addressing existing maintenance issues, ensuring compliance with building codes and regulations, increasing access to services, and reducing operational costs. Government also prioritized projects that will help create jobs, and are ready for work to begin.
The University of Lethbridge project is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending, $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal, $200 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects, $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects, $500 million in municipal infrastructure and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL.
Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and returns investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The Alberta Petrochemicals Incentive Program, part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan, will bring multi-billion dollar investments to petrochemical projects throughout Alberta, helping to strengthen and diversify the province’s economy and create new jobs for Albertans.
The current global health crisis has highlighted the importance of petrochemical manufacturing around the world. Petrochemical facilities make the building blocks required for everyday consumer and professional items like medical equipment, computers and cellphones, personal protective equipment like rubber gloves and masks, car seats and tires, and fertilizer for agriculture and home gardening.
Alberta is already among Canada’s largest hubs for petrochemicals manufacturing, and with global demand for petrochemicals expected to continue to increase, there is a significant opportunity for Albertans and the province to expand this sector. For example, Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Association estimates there could be a further $30 billion of private-sector investment in the province’s petrochemical sector by 2030.

“While Alberta is already a Canadian leader in petrochemicals manufacturing, the sky is the limit for this sector’s benefits to our province. Over the last 10 years, petrochemical investment in the United States reached $250 billion, more than 10 times what was invested in Canada. With our affordable 300-year supply of natural gas, technically skilled and educated workforce, and respected innovation and research sectors, Alberta is ready to seize the opportunity to become a global destination for petrochemical manufacturing, benefiting all Albertans.”
Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity

Compared to previous government petrochemical programs, the Alberta Petrochemicals Incentive Program will cut red tape and increase certainty and flexibility for investors, attracting more financial investment into Alberta’s petrochemicals sector. Key features include:

A 10-year program period during which eligible projects must be built and operational.
Adopting an open and transparent funding process, whereby every project that meets the program’s criteria will receive funding once built and operational. Government will no longer pick winners and losers through a private evaluation process. 
Grants – instead of royalty credits – to be issued to companies after eligible projects are operational. In the current economic climate, grants are the most effective way to attract investment. Grants allow companies to better account for the full value of the incentive provided when calculating their project’s return on investment.  
Making the funds available throughout the program’s duration once the facilities are in service, in order to align with typical business investment cycles.


“The Alberta Petrochemicals Incentive Program will have a significant impact on enhancing the competitiveness of Alberta when attracting large-scale, value-add investments, relative to other global jurisdictions. This program, coupled with the other tremendous competitive advantages that Alberta’s Industrial Heartland has to offer, including world-leading carbon capture and storage infrastructure, will stimulate job-creating economic activity that will benefit all Albertans and all Canadians.”
Mark Plamondon, executive director, Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Association


""Alberta is leading the way on economic recovery. The Alberta Petrochemicals Incentive Program shows that the province understands how to win global-scale chemistry sector investments. In this time of uncertainty, these actions signal confidence in Alberta’s future prosperity and will attract investors to the province.”
Bob Masterson, president and CEO, Chemistry Industry Association of Canada


""Resource Diversification Council member companies commend the Government of Alberta for its bold action introducing a broad-ranging jobs creation program that is intended to attract significant new investment to the Alberta economy, including in the petrochemical sector. Government support is critical to level the playing field with other economic competitors that are aggressively courting investment, especially during these challenging times. Other jurisdictions are doing all that they can to attract investment and the RDC is encouraged to see Alberta sharpen its competitive focus to bring long-term benefit to Albertans.”
David Chappell, board chair, Resource Diversification Council

Government will work with industry over the summer to finalize the program guidelines. More details about eligibility, process, governance and reporting requirements will be available when the program is officially launched in early fall.
Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and return investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada.
Quick facts

Alberta has the most established and potential growth for petrochemical manufacturing centres in Canada through Alberta’s Industrial Heartland, Grande Prairie, Joffre and Medicine Hat.
Every day, people around the world use dozens of products that are made with petrochemicals, including:
	
Medical supplies, such as computers for X-rays and MRIs and personal protective equipment, including disposable masks and gloves
Polyester fabric couches, HD televisions, phones, bicycle helmets, coffeemakers and computers
Car tires, engine hoses, gasoline, radio components and AUX cords, and car seats
Desks, chairs, computers, carpets, cellphones and other office supplies
Food packaging that keeps food fresh and safe during transport and storage


According to the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, Alberta’s chemicals sector, comprised predominantly of petrochemicals, was valued at $12.1 billion and employed about 58,400 people directly and indirectly in 2019.
According to Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Association, there is an opportunity to grow Alberta’s petrochemical sector by more than $30 billion by 2030, resulting in more than 90,000 direct and indirect jobs over the construction and operation periods of new facilities, and more than $10 billion in revenue for the Government of Alberta from corporate and personal income taxes.

The work will include widening Terwillegar Drive from Rabbit Hill Road to and across Anthony Henday Drive to Windermere Boulevard, building a second overpass over Anthony Henday Drive, and making intersection improvements at 23 Avenue and Haddow Drive. This work will support about 865 jobs for Albertans.
The investment will help drive the economic recovery in the province by moving traffic more efficiently in southwest Edmonton – the fastest-growing part of Alberta’s capital city – and the entire capital region.

“This investment in Terwillegar Drive will help support Alberta’s Recovery Plan by ensuring families and businesses can get around faster and safer. I look forward to seeing work get underway on this project, which will create hundreds off jobs and pave the way for economic development in Edmonton for generations to come.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“As a resident of southwest Edmonton who drives these roads every single day, I know how critical this investment is to the overall quality of life for Edmonton families and businesses. Our government recognizes that Edmonton will play a critical role in the economic recovery of our province, which is why we’re investing in completing the expansion of Terwillegar Drive in southwest Edmonton. We’re walking the talk with serious investments in Alberta’s capital city.”
Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs


“I am ecstatic to see that phase two for the Terwillegar Drive expansion is receiving funding. Between the City of Edmonton’s funding of phase one and the Government of Alberta’s funding of phase two, the entire length of Terwillegar Drive will finally be fully upgraded. The residents of southwest Edmonton have been waiting for this for over 30 years and I look forward to seeing shovels in the ground on this project in 2021.”
Tim Cartmell, Ward 9 councillor, City of Edmonton


“This announcement couldn’t come at a better time. Infrastructure investments like this one provide much-needed stimulus by injecting capital into our economy and the creation of good jobs. We’re pleased to see the province and the city working together on the long-awaited enhancements to Terwillegar Drive, which will ensure we move our people and products more efficiently and effectively.”
Janet Riopel, president and CEO, Edmonton Chamber of Commerce.

As Edmonton’s south side continues to grow, completing the expansion of Terwillegar Drive will make it easier to get into and out of the community, especially during the busy morning and evening commutes. Designed to improve long-term productivity, the project is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan.
This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending, $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal, $200 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects, $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects, $500 million in municipal infrastructure and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL.
Alberta’s government is helping to create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and return investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada.
Quick facts

Alberta Transportation is providing up to $120 million in funding to the City of Edmonton for this project.
The work will include:
	
Widening Terwillegar Drive from Rabbit Hill Road to and across Anthony Henday Drive to Windermere Boulevard to four lanes in each direction (this will include a dedicated transit lane).
Building a second overpass over Anthony Henday Drive.
Making intersection improvements at 23 Avenue and Haddow Drive.
Building a multi-use trail on the east boulevard of Terwillegar Drive.
Building a pedestrian bridge, which will take the multi-use trail from Brookview to Brookside.


Between Monday and Friday, about 40,000 vehicles per day travel Terwillegar Drive.

Funding is provided for two projects in Edmonton: $8 million to renew and replace mechanical and electrical systems in the Brain and Aging Research Building, and another $8 million to install a new piping system to heat and cool the Tory Building.
Both projects are ready to start and will create about 90 full-time jobs in Edmonton. Funding for the University of Alberta is part of an additional $98-million commitment to post-secondary institutions for accelerated capital maintenance and renewal, which is expected to create about 533 full-time jobs around the province.
This work will extend the life cycle of both buildings and ensure post-secondary students and staff continue to have high-quality campus experiences. It will also give dozens of Albertans consistent, well-paying jobs – a key government priority under Alberta’s Recovery Plan.

“Our government is committed to developing world-class post-secondary institutions and today’s announcement of an additional $16 million will help us meet students’ evolving needs, give researchers new and better spaces to further their work, and make sure our campuses stay safe and welcoming places. This is part of over $90 million in total that will be provided to our institutions to modernize critical infrastructure and create jobs, as part of our economic recovery plan.”
Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education


“Alberta’s Recovery Plan focuses on infrastructure as a critical component for supporting economic growth and jobs for Albertans. This includes investing in shovel-ready projects to upgrade and maintain public facilities, like this post-secondary institution, that help keep Albertans working and stimulate local economies where it matters most.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure


""Thanks to this generous funding from the Government of Alberta, we can maintain two key areas of teaching, learning, and research on north campus. The upgrades and additions to the Brain and Aging Research Building will enhance one of our state-of-the-art facilities and help continue to facilitate groundbreaking scientific research for the benefit of all Albertans.""
Bill Flanagan, president and vice-chancellor, University of Alberta

Planned upgrades in the Brain and Aging Research Building will support research labs throughout the building’s four floors, while also freeing up more research space on the upper floor. The Tory Building first opened in 1966, and many of its internal parts are original, so a new heating and cooling system will help avoid more costly maintenance in the future.
Budget 2020 already includes $118.5 million for capital maintenance and renewal at colleges, universities and polytechnics.

ASIRT’s investigation was comprehensive and thorough, conducted using current investigative protocols, and in accordance with the principles of Major Case Management (MCM). Numerous witnesses were interviewed, including civilian witnesses. The involved officer declined to provide a statement, as is his constitutional right.
This investigation focused on the handling of a person in the midst of a mental health crisis. Investigation would show, however, that prior to the final incident, the man’s mental health had been markedly deteriorating and interventions had been attempted and failed, leading to the final confrontation.

At the time of his death, the 43-year-old man was approximately 191 cm tall (6’3”) and 101 kg (224 lbs) and had no prior criminal record. In 2015, he was the victim of an assault that resulted in some form of head injury. Friends and family expressed concerns about his declining mental health, which they attributed to this head injury. The man expressed anger towards police for failing to identify the perpetrators; however, there was no record that the matter had ever been reported to CPS.
On January 21, 2018, the man called 911 and requested an ambulance. Police attended and the man told them he was “just messing around” and did not need assistance. As such, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were told that they were not needed. Shortly after, the man called a second time and requested assistance. Police again attended but requested the assistance of EMS on scene. The officers related that the man seemed to be caught in a verbal loop, repeating what sounded like “Bourne, Bourne, Bourne, 911, 911, 911, crickets, crickets, crickets.” He advised police that he was the reincarnation of Jennifer Aniston and told them, “All I want is for someone to tell me I am not insane.” Shortly after 11 p.m., CPS apprehended the man under the Mental Health Act and transported him to the South Health Centre. He was assessed and discharged.
On January 24, 2018, the man spoke with his father and told him he was having mental health issues and that he was going to call 911 and get help. Around midnight, the man again called his father and indicated that he was at the hospital and asked his father to get him a lawyer because he felt the hospital was infringing on his rights. Later that day, the man’s father spoke to someone at the hospital who advised that he had been discharged shortly after 6 a.m., reportedly after a “good night’s sleep.” The father was advised that a doctor determined that there was no medical reason to keep him in hospital and there was no reason for him to see a psychologist.
On January 25, 2018, the man’s father called 911 requesting assistance, indicating that he had spoken with his son, who “seemed out of it,” and that he was concerned that his son might engage in self-harm. CPS responded, but when they arrived on scene, EMS personnel were already present, having responded to the location on an unrelated call. EMS transported the man to the Rockyview Hospital. The father indicated that it was his understanding that he stayed for a few hours before he was once again discharged.
The man next spoke to his father on the evening of January 26, 2018. The father reported that his son seemed more stable, and had told him he was at the casino, that he was tired and was going to get a hotel room. His son did make one cryptic statement to the effect that this was his “last night as a free man,” which he did not explain. This was, tragically, the last time that man would speak to his father.
The Critical Incident
At the time of the incident, the man resided at Grandel Manor, a two-storey apartment building located at 606 68 Avenue SW, in Calgary. The man lived on the second floor in an apartment that had a balcony to the rear of the building, overlooking the parking lot and back alley.
On the night of January 27, 2018, the man and another resident of his building walked to a local pub for a drink. As they walked to the pub, the man ran into traffic, with the resident stating it seemed like he was “trying to get himself killed.” Once at the pub, a conflict with staff led to them leaving after one drink to return to the apartment building.
At about 8:53 p.m., a neighbour called 911 to advise that the man was having some sort of “meltdown” or he was “on something.” The caller advised the man was yelling, screaming and throwing items from his apartment into the hallway. The caller advised that during a brief conversation with the man, he tried to give the caller his pet bearded dragon. The caller advised that this had been going on for about 10 minutes and they were fearful for their safety.
At 8:59 p.m., the same resident who had earlier gone to the pub called 911 and advised that his friend was having “a breakdown.” He advised that the man had previously suffered a brain injury and he was worried that he would harm himself. He also advised that the man had left his pet bearded dragon with him.
Officers responded, arriving on scene at about 9:03 p.m. The officers entered and spoke with the second caller regarding the man’s mental health issues. Officers were aware that the man had previously been apprehended under the Mental Health Act. The officers could hear banging and noise from the man’s apartment and noted numerous items littering the hallway and nearby stairwell, including a smashed air conditioning unit, broken ceramic items and pieces of wood. The man, who was in the apartment behind the closed door, could be heard yelling.
One officer attempted to speak with the man and asked him to come into the hallway so that they could talk, but not to bring anything with him. The officer made this request approximately eight times. The man ultimately acknowledged the officers’ presence from inside the suite, when he said words to the effect of “So what, it’s the police.” The officer continued to encourage the man to come out to speak with him, saying he was concerned about his welfare. At one point, the officer thought that they persuaded the man to come out; however, shortly thereafter, he became more agitated and based on what the officers could hear, resumed smashing things in the apartment. Officers believed, based on the information received, that the man was alone in the suite but could not be sure.
At 9:17 p.m., the decision was made to take a step back and cease trying to talk with the man in order to give him some time to calm down until EMS arrived on scene, at which point they would try to persuade the man to voluntarily go with EMS under the Mental Health Act.
At about 9:21 p.m., an officer parked a marked police vehicle at the rear of the building, in front of a truck identified as belonging to the man. The other officers were either inside or in front of the building. The lone officer could see the man moving in the apartment but could not see specifically what he was doing. What sounded like something being broken and plastic ripping was heard just before the man came out onto his balcony holding what appeared to be a long silver knife in one hand and what was described as an axe in his other hand. The officer indicated that the man began randomly talking about weapons and killing “lots” of people. At about 9:28 p.m, the officer communicated this information to the other officers on scene.
An officer who had been out in front of the building ran to the back of the building to assist, his service pistol drawn at the low ready. As he did so, the officer at the rear asked the man if he had a gun, prompting the man to respond with words to the effect of “No, I wish, I would shoot you all.”
As confirmed by a nearby civilian witness, both officers encouraged the man to calm down. The man climbed onto the balcony railing and jumped off the balcony to the ground below, a distance of approximately 3.92 metres. The second officer told the man to drop the axe. The man responded, “No, I’m going to cut your fucking head off.” The man began very deliberately and quickly advancing on the second officer. In the words of the civilian witness, the man “rushed” the officer. As he did so, he repeated the words “Shoot me, shoot me” as the officer ordered him three or four times to drop the weapon/axe and to stop. The officer’s commands, which were described as clear and concise, were overhead not just by those at the rear of the residence but also by officers and paramedics staged at the front of the building. As the armed man continued closer, the officer fired a single shot that struck the man in the torso. The man twisted around, then fell to the ground. Both the civilian witness and the other officer placed the man as having closed the distance between himself and the second officer to within approximately 3-7 feet before the officer fired.
The two officers secured the man and moved the axe out of his reach. Given the darkness and the snow, they did not immediately see the kitchen knives, which would later be recovered from the snow. The EMS personnel responded immediately to provide emergency treatment and transport to hospital. The man was conscious and complained that his wrists were sore, so the handcuffs were removed. EMS replaced these with soft Velcro restraints at the wrists and legs, as the man became increasingly agitated. Once at the hospital, he immediately underwent emergency surgery; however, he was declared deceased shortly after 2 a.m. on January 28, 2018.
A small black-handled axe and one black-handled kitchen knife were recovered from the snow near where the man fell after being shot. A second black-handled knife was found in the snow under his balcony.
Two additional knives, a folding knife and a throwing knife, were removed from the man’s clothing following the shooting.
 
Top row: Small axe and black-handled knives recovered from the snow. Bottom row: Throwing knife and folding knife recovered from man’s clothing following the shooting. 

The man’s cause of death was determined to be a single gunshot wound to the torso. Toxicology confirmed the presence of alcohol and both the active THC component of cannabis and its metabolite in his body.
Analysis
It is always a tragedy when a life is lost during an encounter with police, even more so when the person dies in the midst of a mental health crisis. It is clear throughout the handling of this matter, however, that the officers were all working towards the safe apprehension of the man under the provisions of the Mental Health Act for assessment and treatment. Unfortunately, even when police act with the best of intentions, their response is determined by the situation. In this case, when the man armed himself and began threatening to kill people, the nature of the encounter changed.
Under the Criminal Code, police officers are granted certain powers and authorities to facilitate the performance of what can be a challenging job. The Criminal Code authorizes a police officer to use as much force as is reasonably necessary in the administration or enforcement of the law. This can, in limited circumstances, include force that is intended or likely to cause grievous bodily harm or death. Resort to lethal force is only permitted where an officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm. Further, the Criminal Code provides that any person, including a police officer, may use reasonable force in self-defence or the defence of another person.
In order for a police officer’s use of force to be authorized, the officer must be acting in the lawful execution of his or her duties. In this particular case, there is no question that all involved officers were acting in the lawful execution of their duties. They had the authority under the Mental Health Act and the Criminal Code to investigate, and apprehend or charge, particularly given the calls from residents who expressed fears for both the man and their own safety.
Upon their arrival, the officers attempted to encourage the man to come speak with them, allowing themselves and the man time to resolve the situation peacefully, with or without the assistance of medical professionals. The strategic decision to step back and contain the man until medical assistance arrived on scene demonstrated their intention to calm things down. It was the man who ultimately escalated the situation to something clearly criminal and life-threatening.
In the circumstances, viewing the incident as a whole, the officer’s use of lethal force, made only upon the man’s rapid advancement on the officer, while armed with an axe and a knife or knives, accompanied by threats to kill, was reasonable and justified. The risk presented by these actions was both serious and immediate. These actions, both objectively and subjectively, were capable of giving rise to a risk of grievous bodily harm or death to the officer, and accordingly, the officer’s decision to fire his service pistol was both lawful and justified. While the man was undoubtedly in the midst of a mental health crisis and potentially suicidal, he was not only capable of causing grievous bodily harm or death, he was threatening to do so. The officer provided clear commands to drop the weapons and/or stop and only fired when the man came close enough to present an imminent threat of grievous bodily harm or death.
Conclusion
There are no reasonable grounds, nor reasonable suspicion, to believe that the officer committed an offence(s) and as such, will not be charged with any offences.
In the vast majority of cases involving a person in the midst of a mental health crisis, intervention, apprehension under the Mental Health Act, and a social-medical approach may be what is called for. It could be a critical mistake and naïve, however, to approach these cases assuming that a mentally ill person is necessarily harmless. Those in the midst of a mental health crisis can be as dangerous and capable of causing harm or killing as any other person, perhaps even more so, as they may not be rational and the opportunity for first responders to employ reason to negotiate a peaceful surrender can be compromised.
The man’s behaviour on January 27, 2018 was that of a person clearly in the height of a mental health crisis. When he was well, prior to his injury in 2015, he was described as a hard worker, and a good son and brother whose family would never have imagined he could be involved in the events that unfolded that night. In this case, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the officers on scene were attempting to work toward a result that would enable the man to obtain the medical help he needed, but the nature of the situation changed dramatically when the man armed himself, made threats to kill, and jumped from the balcony and advanced on the officer.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

“I am pleased to announce that Dave Rodney has been appointed as Alberta’s agent general to Houston. Texas is Alberta’s second-largest export market in the United States, and it is vital we have an in-market presence to lead Alberta’s efforts to expand our commercial ties to the region. With his extensive government experience and his personal drive, Alberta needs someone like Dave who will engage with American business leaders and investors and put Alberta’s interests first. I have the utmost confidence he is the right person for this role.” 
Jason Kenney, Premier  

In his posting as agent general, Rodney will work to establish closer business relationships and pursue new investment opportunities that will revitalize Alberta’s energy sector and create jobs, since the province is a major supplier of energy resources to Texas and other states. Rodney is familiar with the diversity and challenges of the sector through his previous roles in government as the parliamentary secretary for Sustainable Resource Development and as Alberta’s energy representative to the Council of State Governments.
He will also seek business opportunities to expand Alberta’s emerging sectors, including advanced technologies, health sciences, and aerospace and aviation.

“As economies gradually reopen, Alberta needs to be equipped and ready to rebuild its economic relationships with our trading partners. I am pleased that Dave Rodney has agreed to take on the role of agent general; we are beginning a new chapter in Alberta’s relationship with the United States and we need a person of his calibre to seek out new opportunities for Alberta’s businesses.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism

Reporting to the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism, the agent general will play a key role in delivering programming and services that support government priorities in international markets and work closely with the Canadian Consulate in Houston to promote Alberta’s interests in-market.

“I am humbled by the trust that Premier Kenney has placed in me, since he has asked me to assist as Alberta's agent general to Houston, U.S.A. It is an honour to serve the people of the province as we seek to advance the interests of Albertans in this invaluable market. Together, we will prove that investor confidence in numerous sectors is best placed in Alberta; with the resultant improvement of the livelihoods and quality of life of thousands of Albertans. I am ready to play my part in Premier Kenney's efforts to encourage and facilitate further bilateral trade and investment opportunities that will mutually benefit both Alberta and the United States, while seeking to build North American energy self-sufficiency.""
Dave Rodney, Alberta Agent General to the U.S.


“Texas is Alberta’s second-largest partner and a key bilateral relationship. The value of our exports to the Lone Star state is $10.4 billion each year – a number that has been growing even through the last several challenging economic years. This relationship is clearly essential for the North American energy industry, however it has also become important for other strong sectors, including tech and innovation. Our province has a compelling case for greater investment through tax, talent, low cost of living, low cost of office space, and high quality of life. We are becoming hard to ignore. We’re very pleased to see that Alberta will be well-represented in bringing this message to Texas.”
Adam Legge, president, Business Council of Alberta


“We are encouraged to see Alberta’s government strategically advancing our province’s interests and growing markets with our country’s largest trading partner. Growing our relationships and influence with our friends in Texas is something our province can look to in order to help grow our economy in the years to come, and today’s announcement will help facilitate that.”
Terry O’Flynn, board chair, Alberta Enterprise Group


“Canada and the United States have a long history as trading partners, working toward economic growth and a high standard of living for the people of both countries. Alberta supplies significant energy exports to the United States and it is important – now more than ever – to maintain strong relationships and ensure continued market access for our exports.”
Tim McMillan, president and CEO, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers


“Mr. Rodney has been a dedicated public servant and will be a strong representative for the Province of Alberta in this new role. International trade and the Texas market, in particular, are very important for Alberta, and Mr. Rodney’s experience will be of great assistance to Alberta’s exporters seeking to grow in the U.S. markets.”
Joe Lougheed, chair, Calgary Economic Development


“PSAC supported Premier Kenney’s recent mission to Texas and is pleased that it is followed by the appointment of Dave Rodney as Alberta’s agent general to Houston. This is good news for PSAC members as the U.S. is an important source of investment capital for our sector and key export market for oilfield services. An in-market presence in Houston will also be an advantage for Albertan companies seeking opportunities in the U.S. for market intelligence, networking, and exposure.”
Elizabeth Aquin, interim president and CEO, Petroleum Services Association of Canada

Rodney will start his three-year assignment immediately. When the Canada-U.S. border reopens and travel resumes, he will relocate to Houston. Until then, he will connect with American business leaders and investors through other means such as technology. 
He will receive a bi-weekly salary of $9,635.
Quick facts

During his mission to Houston in November 2019, Premier Kenney announced that Alberta would formally establish a presence in Houston.
Texas is Alberta’s second-largest export market overall, and Alberta’s exports to Texas in 2018 totalled $11.6 billion worth of goods. Energy exports accounted for $8 billion.
Alberta is one of the largest suppliers of imported oil and gas to the United States.
In 2018, Alberta’s crude oil exports accounted for about 38 per cent of U.S. crude oil imports.
Alberta is the largest supplier of natural gas to the U.S., providing about 70 per cent of the country’s imports in 2018.
In 2018, Alberta and Texas signed a memorandum of understanding to seek opportunities to enhance trade and investment and to explore prospects for economic development that could contribute to job growth in Alberta and Texas across several sectors.

If passed, Bill 33 will create the Invest Alberta Corporation, an arm’s-length agency that will help promote Alberta as a prime investment location for businesses from across Canada and around the world, attracting high-value, job-creating investment.  

“The Invest Alberta Corporation will lead an aggressive international campaign to attract job-creating investment across key sectors and tell institutional investors the truth about Alberta’s competitiveness and environmentally responsible energy sector. Alberta has seen the flight of tens of billions of dollars of capital in the last five years. In order to get Alberta back to work, we must reverse that flow of investment back to Alberta.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

As an important part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Invest Alberta Corporation would play a central role in Alberta’s economic future. The agency would help instil investor confidence and generate investment in the province’s primary sectors – energy, agriculture and tourism. The corporation would also pursue investment opportunities for Alberta’s high-growth industries, such as technology, aviation and aerospace, and financial services.

“Investment attraction is essential to keep our economy moving. It stimulates sector growth, which in turn creates jobs across the province. The creation of the Invest Alberta Corporation will be pivotal as we plan ahead to restore economic certainty, especially now, when our businesses and Albertans need it most.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism

Alberta must be able to compete with other jurisdictions as global economies reopen. Some jurisdictions in Canada and around the world already have arm’s-length agencies in place to pursue investment opportunities and promote their jurisdictions’ interests. Once created, the new Alberta-based agency would highlight the low tax rates, highly skilled workforce and business-minded government policies that make Alberta a great place for investments.
If the legislation passes, a public board would oversee the corporation’s operations and investment attraction activities. Government would provide $6 million annually for the next three years for its operations.
Invest Alberta will coordinate the work of Alberta’s 11 trade promotion offices around the world, with a renewed focus on attracting foreign direct investment in Alberta. The corporation will also expand its footprint to include key foreign markets for Alberta, beginning with a presence in Houston, Texas.
Alberta’s Recovery Plan builds on our strengths with timely, targeted investments and bold policy reforms that will:

Create tens of thousands of jobs right now.
Make Alberta more competitive in the long term.
Accelerate economic diversification in industries of the future.
Ensure a strong future for the bedrock sector of our economy: Alberta’s innovative energy industry.
Immediately show investors around the world that we mean business.

Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed, and return investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada.

If passed, this legislation could save job creators an estimated $100 million per year by reducing red tape from daily operations – helping them keep their doors open – and provide jobs for hard-working Albertans.

“Our government was elected on the promise of supporting employee choice and to bring balance back to Alberta’s labour laws. This bill will do just that and also help businesses save time and money, letting them focus on getting Albertans back to work while protecting workers.”
Jason Copping, Minister of Labour and Immigration

Bill 32 will provide employees and employers with clearer and more transparent rules promoting fairness and productivity, including more clarity about rest periods and temporary layoff notices.

“As businesses reopen, we need to support our job creators. We told Albertans we would get them back to work and make it easier to do business in Alberta. That’s exactly what we’re doing by cutting this unneeded red tape.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction


""Alberta Construction Association applauds the Government of Alberta for introducing greater flexibility and reduced red tape in averaging agreements, hours of work, and temporary layoffs. Changes to these employment standards support seasonal, remote project-based construction jobs, while maintaining fairness in the workplace.""
Frederick Vine, chairman, Alberta Construction Association


“Merit Contractors Association congratulates the Government of Alberta for returning balance to employers and their employees though revisions to the Labour Relations Code and Employment Standards Act. These positive changes send a message to investors and job creators that Alberta is open for business.”
Malcolm Kirkland, president and chief executive officer, Merit Contractors Association


“The proposed changes in the provisions governing employees in the construction industry are a major step in the right direction for working Albertans. These changes represent good public policy that promotes fair and healthy competition among unions while enhancing worker choice and workplace democracy.”
Dennis Perrin, provincial director, Christian Labour Association of Canada

To help inform these proposed changes, 5,421 responses were received during an online public survey conducted in November 2019.
Restoring balance and economic stability

Clarifying that employees continue to accumulate vacation time while on a job-protected leave.
Clarifying rules for rest periods and flexibility in scheduling breaks.
Restoring balance to the relationship between employers and employees with updated rules for union certification and revocation, such as removing strict timelines and remedial certification provisions.
Increasing employee choice by ensuring union members are not forced to fund political activities and causes without explicit opt-in approval.
Balancing employee rights to fair collective bargaining, striking and picketing with the need to protect businesses and our economy from harm, and ensuring Albertans continue to receive services they rely on.
Preventing unions from disciplining members if they take a significantly different job with a different employer.
Updating rules for collective agreements will allow an existing collective agreement to remain in place if employees in the construction industry choose a new union before it expires.
Changes to collective agreements and first contract arbitration will reduce red tape, encourage stability and help employers and employees work together to reach agreements.
Increasing transparency and democracy in the workplace by making sure employees know how unions are spending their money.
Changing rules for construction industry to ensure workforce stability and to attract major projects and investment.

Keeping businesses open and Albertans employed

Updating rules for temporary layoff notices to help employees stay attached to their jobs longer.
Adding flexibility to rules for hours of work averaging arrangements to make it easier for employers to set up arrangements, create schedules, and calculate overtime.
Helping youth find work, and reducing red tape and administrative burdens by expanding the types of jobs 13- and 14-year-olds are allowed to do without first needing a permit.
Providing flexibility to the Labour Relations Board to expedite processes and efficiency during an emergency.

Saving employers time and money

Creating simpler and more flexible rules for general holiday pay, group terminations, payment of final earnings upon termination, payroll processes and paying administrative penalties to help employers save time and money in their daily operations.
Making it easier for employers to apply for variances and exemptions.
Allowing unions and employers to agree on standards that may work for them.
Enabling the Labour Relations Board to serve employers, employees and unions more efficiently by reducing administrative burdens, costs and unnecessary hearings.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




By amending the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act, the government is eliminating confusion about what constitutes a mineral by providing clear definitions in legislation. This will ensure sand continues to be regulated under its current process, which is simple, straightforward and protects the environment.

“Job creators should not need interpreters to understand legislation and regulatory laws. That’s why the government is taking action to ensure that sand and gravel operators have clear definitions that are accurate in legislation. Environment and Parks has had an effective and environmentally sound regulatory system in place for more than 15 years to review and approve projects. This bill will provide clarity and consistency for job creators in the sand and gravel industry while still maintaining stringent environmental protection regulations.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

If passed, Bill 31 would amend the definition of minerals and pits in the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA), and remove references to silica sand in the Public Lands Act (PLA). 
On May 6, the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled that sand is a mineral under the EPEA. This means that sand operations above 45,000 tonnes each year must be regulated as a quarry instead of a pit. Before this decision, all projects removing sand were regulated as pits.
Legislative changes to two acts are needed to provide clarity and regulatory certainty for operators:

By amending the EPEA, we are removing confusion about what constitutes a mineral. This will ensure sand continues to be regulated under its current process, which is simple, straightforward and reflects its well understood environmental impacts.
By amending the PLA to remove references to silica sand, we are creating certainty about the interpretation of sand by eliminating unclear and duplicative terminology. Since sand is already defined in provincial legislation, also defining silica sand makes application documents unnecessarily complicated for operators.

The court decision affects about 500 applications that are currently awaiting review. Applicants submitted the information required for a pit authorization – not a quarry approval – so the applications are now incomplete and cannot be authorized in their current state without the passing of Bill 31.
Quick facts

Without government’s legislative amendments, any application for a sand project that is more than 45,000 tonnes annually now needs to be revised to include complex approval requirements and an environmental impact assessment (EIA).
There are no consequences to the end of life/reclamation as a result of these proposed legislative amendments. Quarries and pits are both required to be reclaimed at the end of their life cycle.

Proposed amendments will improve governance and accountability, improve access to medically necessary surgeries, and engage more Albertans in making sure the health-care system and health professionals meet their health needs.  

“We are ensuring the legislation governing our health system reflects our modern reality, and enables future innovation. The proposed amendments will ensure patients’ voices are included in the health-care system, help reduce surgical wait times and clarify roles and accountabilities of health system partners.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Highlights of Bill 30, the Health Statutes Amendment Act, include:

Supporting and strengthening the work of the Health Quality Council of Alberta so it can drive health system improvements and positive change for patients and families.
Increasing the number of public members on Health Professional Regulatory College councils to ensure Albertans have a stronger voice and greater role in professional oversight.
Streamlining the approval process for chartered surgical facilities to operate so they can provide more high-quality, publicly funded surgeries to help reduce surgical wait times without compromising patient safety or quality of care.
Making it easier for physicians to enter into alternative relationship plans for compensation.
Enabling government to contract with a range of organizations to operate medical clinics so physicians can focus on providing patient care, rather than administration.
Clarifying the role of Alberta Health Services as the province’s single health authority, with Covenant Health as a strategic partner and the largest faith-based health-care provider.
Ensuring the Hospital Privileges Appeals Board continues to have a strong, qualified group of members to review grievances brought forward by medical staff against hospital boards.
Clarifying COVID-19 quarantine requirements under the Public Health Act to clearly articulate that all international travellers must quarantine for 14 days while the related chief medical officer of health orders are in effect.


“We value being officially recognized as Alberta’s one health authority, and will continue to work closely with our partners to provide quality health services across the province that meet the needs of patients and families.”
Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO, Alberta Health Services


“CARNA believes the voice of patients and their families is critical when setting health-care policy and supports any government direction that legitimizes this voice.” 
Dennie Hycha, president, College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta

Bill 30 would also repeal some legislation that no longer applies, since the bills were written when Alberta had multiple health regions. Full details of the Health Statutes Amendment Act are available online.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




A sandhill crane hunt launches on September 1 in more than 50 wildlife management units in southern and east-central Alberta.

“It’s great to see widespread support for a sandhill crane season in Alberta, which will support the province’s wildlife management goals and boost local economies. Alberta hunters care deeply about the province’s environment, species and wild places, and providing another opportunity to engage in a pursuit that supports conservation as well as economic activity is a win-win.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks


“The Alberta Fish and Game Association is pleased that Alberta hunters will have the opportunity to participate in the sustainable harvest of sandhill cranes starting this fall. The multi-jurisdictional population and harvest monitoring undertaken by Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the support of this season by Alberta Environment and Parks, under the leadership of Minister Nixon, has made this opportunity possible.”
Brian Dingreville, President, The Alberta Fish and Game Association


“This announcement opens up a great opportunity for Albertans to participate in the sustainable harvest of a waterfowl species that has been hunted for many years across the rest of its range. Sandhill crane makes excellent table fare and I am certain Alberta’s waterfowl hunters will find that putting in the effort to harvest a Sandhill crane for a family meal is well worth it.”
Todd Zimmerling, President & CEO, Alberta Conservation Association

The Alberta sandhill crane hunt will be similar to sandhill crane hunts in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with Alberta taking additional precautions by limiting sandhill crane hunting season to areas that are not known to overlap with the whooping crane migration or breeding range.
The number of sandhill cranes in the province has increased steadily in recent years with exceptional survival rates for both young and adult birds.
Alberta’s new sandhill crane hunt is supported by Alberta hunting stakeholders, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the Central Flyway Council.
Quick facts

The new sandhill crane hunt will run concurrently with Alberta’s waterfowl season.
Participating in the sandhill crane hunt requires a provincial game bird licence and a federal migratory bird licence.
Sandhill cranes are hunted and eaten throughout their range. The Alberta hunt is expected to add only two per cent to the number of sandhill cranes harvested across North America.
Sandhill crane hunting seasons have existed in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba for more than 50 years, with the sandhill crane population remaining healthy.
In 2018 – the latest year for which we have numbers –fishing, hunting, trapping, and sport-shooting activities contributed $1.8 billion to Alberta’s GDP supporting 11,700 jobs, and generating $875 million in labour income.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Distribution of masks through these restaurant partners will resume on July 13. More details will be included with the official launch announcement.
In June, 20 million masks were distributed through restaurant partners, municipalities, long-term care facilities, First Nations and Metis Settlements, and other organizations. Alberta is the only province in Canada to take this important step to help limit the spread of COVID-19 throughout the province.

“The first phase of free mask distribution in Alberta was a huge success and the response was an incredible show of community support. Thank you to all Albertans who are doing their part to keep each other safe as we move through stage two of relaunch.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Wearing a non-medical mask when it's difficult to maintain physical distancing of two metres is one way we can continue to limit the spread of COVID-19 as we relaunch our province. This initiative is a key part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely reopen our economy while protecting Albertans from COVID-19.
In addition to the masks now being resupplied to restaurant partner locations, government is also providing more masks to:

Municipalities without easy access to a restaurant partner location
First Nations and Metis Settlements
Places of worship
Transit services provincewide, including in Calgary and Edmonton
	
7-Eleven Canada is providing no-cost shipping of masks from the government’s warehouses to transit system operators across the province


Seniors organizations and independent living facilities
Long-term care and supportive living facilities
Women’s shelters, homeless shelters and street outreach programs
Addiction treatment centres
Other organizations that have highlighted a need for masks

Quick facts

Mask use is not mandatory; they are an option for situations where maintaining a distance of two metres is not possible.
This program is intended to supplement an individual’s own efforts to acquire non-medical masks. Albertans who wish to use non-medical masks are encouraged to purchase their own supply from local retailers in addition to using those provided by government.
Contact 211 for assistance if you cannot access a restaurant partner or access masks through alternate municipal or community providers.
Alberta 211 is a community service partner supporting the distribution of masks. Any concerns or complaints about the distribution of masks should be directed to the feedback form on alberta.ca/masks.
Instructions for proper care and use of non-medical masks are available at alberta.ca/masks.
7-Eleven Canada is providing logistics support to ship non-medical masks to transit system operators across the province.

Choosing the right non-medical mask




Les masques non médicaux gratuits seront bientôt de retour dans les restaurants A&W, McDonald's Canada et Tim Hortons de l'Alberta.
La distribution de masques par ces restaurants partenaires reprendra le 13 juillet. Plus de détails seront inclus dans l'annonce officielle du lancement.
En juin dernier, 20 millions de masques ont été distribués par l'intermédiaire des restaurants partenaires, des municipalités, des établissements de soins de longue durée, des Premières nations et des établissements métis, et d'autres organismes. L'Alberta est la seule province canadienne à avoir pris cette mesure importante pour limiter la propagation de la COVID-19 dans toute la province.

« La première phase de distribution gratuite de masques en Alberta a remporté un énorme succès et a permis à la population de démontrer l’appui communautaire incroyable qu’elle manifeste. Nous remercions tous les Albertains et toutes les Albertaines qui font leur part pour assurer la sécurité de tout un chacun alors que nous traversons la deuxième étape de la relance. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé

Le port d'un masque non médical lorsqu'il est difficile de maintenir une distance physique de deux mètres est une façon de continuer à limiter la propagation de la COVID-19 pendant la relance économique de notre province. Cette initiative est un élément clé de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta, qui vise à remettre notre économie sur les rails en toute sécurité, tout en protégeant la population albertaine contre la COVID-19.
En plus des masques qui sont distribués de nouveau dans les restaurants partenaires, le gouvernement en fournira également aux entités suivantes :

les municipalités qui n'ont pas facilement accès à un restaurant partenaire
les Premières nations et les établissements métis
les lieux de culte
les services de transport en commun de toute la province, y compris ceux de Calgary et d’Edmonton
	
les dépanneurs 7-Eleven Canada assurent l'expédition gratuite de masques depuis les entrepôts du gouvernement vers les exploitants de systèmes de transit de la province


les organismes de personnes âgées et les centres de vie autonome
les centres de soins de longue durée et les centres de soutien
les refuges pour femmes, les refuges pour sans-abri et les organismes de sensibilisation communautaire dans la rue
les centres de traitement des toxicomanies
d'autres organisations qui en ont fait la demande

En bref

L'utilisation du masque n'est pas obligatoire; il s’agit d’une solution pour les situations où il n'est pas possible de maintenir une distance de deux mètres des autres.
Ce programme est destiné à soutenir les efforts des gens qui veulent acquérir des masques non médicaux. Les Albertains et les Albertaines qui souhaitent porter des masques non médicaux sont encouragés à s'approvisionner auprès de détaillants locaux en plus d’utiliser ceux qui sont fournis par le gouvernement.
Composez le 211 pour obtenir de l'aide si vous ne pouvez pas accéder à un restaurant partenaire ou à des masques par l'intermédiaire d'autres fournisseurs municipaux ou communautaires.
La ligne téléphonique Alberta 211 est un partenaire de services communautaires qui soutient la distribution de masques. Toute préoccupation ou plainte concernant la distribution de masques doit être communiquée au moyen du formulaire de commentaires accessible sur le site alberta.ca/masks (en anglais seulement).
Les instructions concernant le soin et l'utilisation appropriés des masques non médicaux sont offertes sur le site alberta.ca/masks (en anglais seulement).
Les dépanneurs 7-Eleven Canada fournissent un soutien logistique pour l'expédition des masques non médicaux aux exploitants des réseaux de transport en commun de la province.

“July 4 marks the start of Canada’s National Fishing Week and Alberta’s second Free Family Fishing Weekend of 2020.
“Fishing is a unique outdoor experience enjoyed in all parts of our province by Albertans of all ages. Getting out on the water is an important tradition for many families in the province.
“As an avid outdoorsman, I appreciate the quality and diversity of fishing experiences that are found here in Alberta.
“As Minister of Environment and Parks, I’m focused on ensuring Albertans have even more opportunities to enjoy a rewarding fishing experience in our province, while ensuring we maintain healthy fish populations.  
“Last winter, we spoke with some of Alberta’s most passionate anglers at open houses across the province on ideas to improve fishing opportunities, while continuing to protect species at risk. This valuable feedback is reflected in our 2020 sportfishing regulations.
“One of the highlights of National Fishing Week is Alberta’s Free Family Fishing Weekend on July 4 and 5. If it’s been a while since your last catch or you’ve been planning to teach your kids to fish, there’s no better time.
“Everything you need to plan your next Alberta fishing adventure can be found online. Visit mywildalberta.ca for a list of stocked waterbodies, fish handling tips and Alberta’s 2020 sportfishing regulations.
“I hope you’ll find the time to head out to your favourite spot during National Fishing Week or try fishing for the first time during Alberta’s free fishing weekend. Good luck!”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Almost 12 years after TC Energy first proposed the project, thousands of local workers, including engineers, welders, heavy equipment operators, labourers, teamsters, safety inspectors, Indigenous monitors and other skilled tradespeople, are lacing up their work boots near Oyen and beginning construction on the Alberta spread of the 1,947-kilometre pipeline.
Keystone XL will safely and reliably deliver up to 830,000 barrels per day of western Canadian crude oil from Hardisty to Steele City, Neb., where it will connect with existing facilities to reach U.S. Gulf Coast refiners to meet critical needs for transportation fuel and other life-enhancing products. Our province’s $1.5 billion equity stake in Keystone XL will enhance and protect the value of our natural resources, to the benefit of all Albertans.

“After many years of stringent environmental review, collaboration with landowners, local officials and Indigenous groups and a dogged determination to never say die, this project – essential to our economic recovery – is well underway. Not only will Keystone XL create jobs when they are needed most, it will strengthen continental energy security and independence by ensuring that Canadian oil – developed under the world’s highest environmental, human rights, and labour standards – continues to be a dominant force in global supply.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

The project will see about 2,000 construction workers hired in Alberta over the next two years, spurring thousands of additional jobs and increased economic activity in associated trades, retail, and hospitality services along the construction route. Overall, the project will contribute about $2.4 billion to Canada’s GDP and will generate more than $7 million in property taxes in the first year in service. It’s estimated the project will generate $30 billion in tax and royalty revenues for current and future generations of Albertans.

“Keystone XL is an important energy infrastructure project that is poised to put thousands of people to work, generate substantial economic benefits and strengthen North American energy security. We greatly appreciate Premier Kenney’s partnership in this important investment and we look forward to working with his government as we continue to invest in and strengthen Alberta’s economy. We also strongly value the ongoing collaboration and support from First Nations, building trades unions, landowners, and our contractors and suppliers over the last dozen years.”
Richard Prior, president, Keystone XL


“When post-pandemic energy demand revives, there will be a greater need than ever for Alberta to get our energy to market. We are immensely proud of our industry and will continue to stand alongside it and advocate for its resurgence. The Canadian oil sands will continue to be developed and continue to serve as a stable, reliable and responsible source of energy for Canada, the United States and the world.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy


“Keystone XL not only benefits the province’s economic wellbeing, it also benefits our municipality. By working together with the Province of Alberta, TC Energy, Michels and local officials, we will ensure the continued prosperity of our rural communities.”
Roger Didychuk, senior vice-president, SITE Resource Group

Investing in Keystone XL is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending, $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal, $150 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects, $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects, $500 million in municipal infrastructure and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL.
Quick facts

269 kilometres of pipeline will be constructed and commissioned in Alberta over the next three years.
Keystone XL is expected to be complete and operational in 2023.
Safety is the project’s highest priority, and with the current and evolving COVID-19 conditions, construction crews will continue to take guidance from health authorities to determine the most proactive and responsible actions in order to ensure the workforce and the surrounding communities are safe during Keystone XL’s construction activities.

“In 2016, a piece of rope tied into a noose was found taped to the door of an operating room at the Grande Prairie Hospital. In August of 2019, I was first made aware of this incident and was reassured by senior officials that the matter was being dealt with appropriately.
“Recently, individuals with first-hand knowledge of the incident have raised this matter again, questioning how AHS handled this matter in 2016. I share their concerns and I am not satisfied that this matter was handled appropriately.
“Racism and bigotry have no place in our health-care system. That’s why I am announcing an independent third-party investigation of how this matter was handled by Alberta Health Services.
“It also appears that the investigation was limited by medical staff bylaws that govern how AHS responds to complaints and disciplines staff. These bylaws have not been updated in more than a decade. Consequently, I have issued a directive requiring AHS to revise their bylaws within 60 days.
“Finally, I will be introducing legislation next week that will increase the number of public representatives on college councils, hearing tribunals and complaint review committees from 25 per cent to 50 per cent – which will increase the public’s oversight of health professions.
“These initial steps are only the beginning. The review, which will be made public, will undoubtedly bring further required changes to our attention. While it may be uncomfortable for some, Albertans demand and expect our health-care system to reject racism and intolerance. If our system failed, we will fix it.”

Albertans’ donations, combined with government’s matching dollars, raised about $7 million for the designated COVID-19 fundraising campaigns. Donations will help feed the hungry, care for seniors, support at-risk children, and keep Albertans employed.

“Albertans have come together to help others during a time when we are all struggling with different challenges due to COVID-19. As we begin the road to recovery, we thank Albertans for their overwhelming response and for kindly donating to help these fundraising campaigns so they can continue to meet the needs of vulnerable communities. Every donation matters, and we are hearing amazing stories about the great work our partner charities are doing to get dollars quickly to local charities delivering services to Albertans in need.”

Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women



“Thanks to the generosity of Albertans and the Government of Alberta’s matching program, millions of dollars have been raised to support people most at risk during COVID-19. We’ve been able to work with local partners, philanthropists, and a strong network of social agencies to quickly provide help with basic needs like food, shelter, mental health supports, technology, and personal protective equipment. This has made a huge difference in our communities at a time when many Albertans are struggling with unemployment, poverty, isolation, homelessness and other challenges. As the province moves from emergency response to recovery, we will continue to help vulnerable individuals, families, children and seniors. Thank you to Minister Aheer and the Government of Alberta for your tremendous support.”
Karen Young, president and CEO, United Way of Calgary and Area

COVID-19 fundraising programs play an important role in ensuring donations flow through to local community-based non-profits and charitable organizations delivering services to vulnerable Albertans. We salute the following partner organizations for making this initiative such a success through their campaigns:

La province remercie les Albertains et les Albertaines d’avoir versé 5 millions de dollars aux organismes de bienfaisance participant au programme de dons jumelés.
Le gouvernement de l’Alberta a appuyé les efforts de lutte contre la pandémie de COVID-19 en s’engageant à doubler les dons versés entre le 15 avril et le 31 mai à huit organismes de bienfaisance enregistrés en Alberta, dans la limite de 2 millions de dollars. Les dons ainsi collectés, associés aux dons jumelés du gouvernement, ont permis de recueillir environ 7 millions de dollars dans le cadre des campagnes partenaires de lutte contre la pandémie. Les dons permettront d’apporter une aide alimentaire, de prendre soin des personnes âgées, de soutenir les enfants à risque et de préserver les emplois.

« Les Albertains et les Albertaines se sont unis pour aider les autres à un moment où nous sommes tous aux prises avec différentes difficultés en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19. Maintenant que nous sommes sur la voie du rétablissement, nous remercions la population pour sa réaction extraordinaire et pour ses dons généreux en faveur des collectes de fonds qui permettront de poursuivre les actions au profit des communautés vulnérables. Chaque don compte, et nous recevons des récits étonnants sur les efforts que font nos organismes de bienfaisance partenaires pour reverser rapidement cet argent aux organismes caritatifs locaux qui fournissent des services aux personnes dans le besoin. »
Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine


« Grâce à la générosité des Albertains et des Albertaines et au programme de dons jumelés du gouvernement de l’Alberta, des millions de dollars ont été recueillis pour soutenir les personnes les plus à risque pendant la pandémie. Nous avons pu travailler avec des partenaires locaux, des philanthropes et un solide réseau d’agences sociales afin d’apporter rapidement de l’aide pour les besoins de base, comme la nourriture, le logement, le soutien en santé mentale, la technologie et l’équipement de protection individuelle. Cela a eu un énorme impact dans nos collectivités à un moment où de nombreuses personnes sont aux prises avec le chômage, la pauvreté, l’isolement, l’itinérance et d’autres difficultés. Alors que la province passe de l’intervention d’urgence au rétablissement, nous continuerons d’aider les personnes, les familles, les enfants et les aînés vulnérables. Merci à la ministre Aheer et au gouvernement de l’Alberta pour leur formidable soutien. »
Karen Young, première dirigeante, Centraide de Calgary et de la région

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The twinning project will support about 755 jobs and will drive economic recovery and diversification in southern Alberta. Twinning Highway 3 will improve safety along this increasingly busy portion of the highway.

“This project is part of our government’s $10-billion economic recovery program. We need to build, diversify and create jobs following the largest financial hit in Alberta’s history. These projects lay the foundation for the private sector to create thousands of well-paying jobs for workers while creating many spinoff benefits for Alberta — including making communities more attractive to businesses looking to relocate. A strong highway network is vital to create jobs, spur economic growth and get Alberta back on track to economic recovery and growth.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“The agri-business sector is a key part of Alberta’s economic recovery. That’s why we are investing in critical infrastructure that creates jobs now and ensures that we can support the growth of this important sector. Twinning Highway 3 makes the roads safer, more efficient, and gets Albertans working when jobs are needed most.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation


“The twinning of Highway 3, between Taber and Burdett, will not only increase safety in the movement of goods, services and people but it will also be a major infrastructure tool in helping establish this busy corridor as the agri-food hub of Canada.”
Grant Hunter, MLA for Taber-Warner

Highway 3 is a vital east-west link, and is the major connector between Saskatchewan and British Columbia, south of the Trans-Canada Highway.
Designed to improve long-term productivity, the Highway 3 twinning project is part of the more than $10-billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending; $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal; $150 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects; $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects; $500 million in municipal infrastructure; and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL.
Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefit Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and return investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada.
Quick facts

Construction will begin in 2021.
The project will take about three years to complete.
In addition to twinning, there will be key intersection improvements, in particular at Highway 877 at Grassy Lake.
This stretch of Highway 3 sees about 3,900 vehicles per day.

“The Government of Alberta welcomes the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), which comes into effect July 1. Alberta relies on the free flow of trade and investment for job creation across all sectors of the economy. This agreement will serve as the foundation of our economic relationship with our North American partners – including our largest trading partner the United States – for years to come. This is an important milestone for Alberta, and for Canada.
“CUSMA provides clarity, economic stability and facilitates job creation with an agreed set of rules that govern cross-border trade and investment with our trading partners in Mexico and the United States. The CUSMA is a modern and forward-looking agreement, covering new areas such as digital trade, and encouraging new entrants to trade, such as micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, making it easier to attract investment into these areas.
“For Alberta businesses, this means we can broaden our commercial ties with certainty and forge bonds with job creators across the continent. We have the opportunity to accelerate the flow of Alberta’s goods and expand our exports throughout North America.
“As we begin to reopen our economy, the timing of the CUSMA is significant, especially for our province’s energy sector. Because Alberta’s energy industry is highly integrated throughout North America, this is a signal to investors they can look to our province with increased confidence as an attractive investment destination. 
“Moving forward, our government will continue its efforts to strengthen our relationships throughout the world to grow our economy, encourage trade and investment, and pursue innovation and commercialization of new technology that will help create jobs across the province.”

By fully implementing the Job Creation Tax Cut a year and a half ahead of schedule, government is sending a strong message that we are open for business. Alberta’s general corporate income tax rate is now at least 30 per cent lower than any other provincial rate.
Accelerating the tax cut provides Alberta businesses with confidence and certainty as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, freeing up resources to hire Albertans. It also makes Alberta an attractive location for companies outside the province to relocate and take advantage of the province’s competitive tax rate.

“As Alberta moves towards recovery, we remain committed to making our province one of the most tax-competitive jurisdictions in North America and the top business destination in the country. The Job Creation Tax Cut will dovetail with the new Innovation Employment Grant to support a wide range of Alberta job creators.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

Corporate tax cut and new incentive promote economic diversification
The Innovation Employment Grant, recently announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan, will complement the Job Creation Tax Cut by targeting small and medium-sized companies in the early stages of operation. Combined, these programs will reward innovation, diversification and investment by businesses of all sizes in all sectors of the economy.
Both measures support the development of new products and ideas, but a low general corporate tax rate also provides a strong incentive to commercialize those products here in Alberta, instead of other jurisdictions.
A low general corporate tax rate also encourages diversification, as it provides more benefit to companies outside the resource sector and adds extra incentive to invest and grow in Alberta. This includes both smaller and larger firms, as government estimates that 75 per cent of the businesses benefiting from the Job Creation Tax Cut file taxes as small businesses.   
More information about the Innovation Employment Grant will be available soon.
Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and returns investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada.

Happy Canada Day!
153 years ago today our great Northern Dominion began, binding together the colonies and territories of British North America.
Their unity was built on a shared belief in ordered liberty, safeguarded by the institutions of Parliamentary government within a constitutional Monarchy.  With Confederation, our founders also launched a bold experiment that sought unity in diversity, bringing together in one political community different cultures, languages and faiths.
The country that they united developed through the sacrifices of waves of newcomers, each drawn to Canada as a land of freedom and opportunity, a freedom that Canadians defended at great cost on foreign battlefields.  On this Dominion Day, let us be grateful for their sacrifices, and for the vision of our founders, foremost amongst them Sir John A Macdonald. 
As Albertans, let us celebrate the enormous contribution that we have made as champions of enterprise, helping to make Canada one of the most prosperous nations on Earth.  It is no accident that our province’s motto “fortis et liber,” comes from the national anthem’s call for a “true North strong and free.”
Let us also resolve to continue building a Canada that is freer, fairer, and more just.  We must keep continue on the path of reconciliation with Indigenous people whose ancestors first inhabited this land, ensuring that equality of opportunity is a reality for them, and for Canadians of all backgrounds. And we must repair inequities within the federation, so that all provinces are unleashed to flourish and prosper.
Today should be one of gratitude and celebration as we strive to fulfill the vision of the martyr of Confederation, Thomas D’Arcy McGee:
“I see in the not remote distance, one great nationality bound, like the shield of Achilles, by the blue rim of ocean – I see it quartered into many communities – each disposing of its internal affairs – but all bound together by free institutions, free intercourse, and free commerce; I see within the round of that shield, the peaks of the Western mountains and the crests of the Eastern waves…, I see a generation of industrious, contented, moral men, free in name and in fact – men capable of maintaining, in peace and in war, a Constitution worthy of such a country.”
*Editor's note: statement has been updated from a previous version.

The investment in the agri-food hub, which is part of the centre’s larger redevelopment project, will serve as an anchor for growth of Alberta’s value-added food sector.
The project aligns with the work of the regional partners in Canada's Premier Food Corridor to attract private investment and includes collaboration with Lethbridge College, capitalizing on their applied research success in the agri-food sector and providing applied learning opportunities for culinary students.
The project will generate 400 construction jobs and an estimated 50 incremental jobs after completion. Its estimated ongoing economic impact will grow to $90 million annually, an economic boost to Lethbridge and southern Alberta.

“Alberta’s agriculture and agri-food sector is a cornerstone of our economic recovery plan. This investment will help get Albertans back to work now and will fuel the long-term growth of Alberta’s dynamic agriculture industry.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

The expansion will also more than double Exhibition Park’s capacity, attracting more and larger national and international events. As well, there will be enhanced incubation opportunities for local producers to build their business and sell their products nationally and internationally.
Increasing the space available for food production by more than 10 times the current amount means more possibilities for the students in Lethbridge College’s Culinary Arts Program. This expansion will help Exhibition Park offer the finest and largest-scale farm-to-table culinary experience in the industry. Exhibition Park is currently working with area partners to make this a reality.

“Agriculture contributes so much to Alberta’s economy and this investment at Exhibition Park to develop an agri-food hub will continue to strengthen our agriculture sector.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


“It’s hard to overstate how important Exhibition Park is to Lethbridge, socially and economically. This investment will help it serve even more of Lethbridge and southern Alberta and I look forward to attending events in the new space.”
Nathan Neudorf, MLA for Lethbridge-East


“The City of Lethbridge welcomes this investment in the Exhibition Park agri-food hub. We see this project as an economic catalyst that will lead to greater investment and job creation as agricultural industries further develop in the city and the region. We are proud to be recognized as part of Canada’s premier food corridor and look forward to strengthening that position with this project.”
Chris Spearman, mayor, City of Lethbridge


“This commitment to the community, industry and region establishes immediate and long-term job creation, creates external investment opportunity and further showcases southern Alberta as a world-leading agricultural production and processing region.”
Mike Warkentin, chief operating officer, Lethbridge and District Exhibition

Quick facts

The expansion project is targeting the following:
	
A 22 per cent increase in event capacity
A food production capacity increase of more than 10 times the current amount


Exhibition Park, also known as the Lethbridge and District Exhibition, is Alberta’s fourth-oldest agricultural society.
	
It held its first fair in 1897.

Before this regulation amendment, only physicians could complete driver medical examination forms in Alberta. Driver medical examinations are required at specified intervals for drivers age 75 or older, commercial drivers, and those with certain medical conditions.

“Nurse practitioners are already able to complete the tasks to assess a driver’s medical fitness, but they are not legally allowed to conduct a driver medical exam and fill out the driver medical form in Alberta. This change is long overdue and will reduce red tape while increasing Albertans’ access to services without affecting safety on our roads.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation


“Our government is creating another way for Albertans to benefit from the skills of nurse practitioners as part of our broader strategy to allow all health-care professionals to work to their full competence and give Albertans more choice and better access to services.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“Nurse practitioners have advanced qualifications that enable them to provide independent primary care in Alberta. This is a welcome change and will give nurse practitioners more opportunities to work to their full scope of practice. We will continue to work with government to support nurse practitioners’ expanded role in our health system.”
Mary-Elizabeth Cooper, president, Nurse Practitioner Association of Alberta


“CARNA is pleased Albertans will now benefit from the skills and professionalism of nurse practitioners with this amendment. Keeping Albertans safe on our roads is critical and nurse practitioners are an ideal health-care profession to help safeguard the licensing process.”
Dennie Hycha, council president, College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta

The government will engage with other health-care professional regulatory colleges to determine if other health-care providers are also qualified to conduct driver medical examinations. 
Quick facts

The amendment to the Operator Licensing and Vehicle Control Regulation authorizes nurse practitioners to complete driver medical examinations.
About 150,000 driver’s medical examination forms are filed with Alberta Transportation each year. Most are for individuals applying for a commercial driver’s licence.
Driver’s medical examinations are required for:
	
Class 3, 5, 6 and 7 licences at age 75, age 80 and every two years after age 80
Class 1, 2 and 4 commercial driver’s licences every  five years until age 45, every two years after age 45 until age 65, and annually after age 65
Medically-at-risk drivers


Allowing nurse practitioners to complete driver medical examinations is not considered a change in responsibilities, as the tasks they complete when assessing a driver’s medical fitness are already within their regulated scope of practice under the Health Professions Act.

The $50-million project will support about 256 jobs and address traffic safety issues associated with narrow segments along this busy corridor by increasing lane and shoulder widths.

“Yellowhead County and the Municipal District of Greenview are growing destinations for tourism and recreation, as well as expanding natural gas developments and increasing forestry activity. Improving Highway 40 will give Albertans better access to explore the Rocky Mountains and will create jobs and economic development in our important natural resource industries. This project is part of our government’s recovery plan to create jobs, build infrastructure to spur economic growth, and continue to diversify our economy.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation


“In West Yellowhead, we love the Rockies and want people to be able to live here safely, as well as work and visit. These needed infrastructure improvements south of Grande Cache will help give industry, residents and visitors peace of mind while exploring one of the most scenic places in our great province.""
Martin Long, MLA for West Yellowhead

Highway 40 is an important corridor for accessing tourism and recreation opportunities, transporting services to communities north of the Yellowhead Highway, and supporting the growing natural gas and forestry industries in the area.
Quick facts

The 36-kilometre section of Highway 40 will be expanded from a width of eight metres to 12 metres, and will include culvert extensions.
Construction could begin in 2021.
The project will take about two years to complete.

William Watson Lodge provides year-round, barrier-free wilderness lodging for persons with disabilities, seniors and their families. Beginning in late July, the existing main day lodge will be demolished and a new day lodge will be built.
The Government of Alberta is investing $6 million into the project, which will take about two years to complete and create well-paying construction jobs for Alberta workers.

“William Watson Lodge has served Albertans with accessibility challenges for almost 40 years and we want this tradition to continue. The new day lodge will vastly improve safety for visitors, caregivers and staff, and construction will create jobs for Albertans. I look forward to seeing the new facility when it is fully operational and ready to welcome visitors again.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

The day lodge is at the end of its lifespan and requires replacement in order to continue to be able to serve Albertans living with disabilities and Alberta seniors. Design plans will improve its environment footprint by using low-impact building materials and reducing the facility’s energy consumption while complying with international accessibilty standards. To ensure a safe construction site, the area will be fully closed to visitors for the duration of the rebuild.  
Built in 1981, William Watson Lodge has connected people of all abilities, ages and cultures to recreational opportunities in nature.
Until construction is underway, the lodge and campground will accept bookings for visitors from July 2-26. To make a reservation, please call 403-591-7227.
Quick facts

William Watson Lodge was named after an Albertan who worked to improve the social and environmental conditions for persons with disabilities.
The site contains:
22 accessible cabins
11 accessible RV (full-service) campsites
one comfort parks trailer
one accessible comfort camping hut
accessible picnic sites
more than 20 kilometres of accessible trails

The increase applies to attendees at community outdoor events such as festivals, fireworks displays, rodeos and sporting events, and outdoor performances.
All public health measures, including physical distancing, remain in place. Seated outdoor events will still require the necessary space between families and cohorts within stadium-style seating.
Any large gathering increases the risk of transmission. Evidence suggests that outdoor events have a lower risk of transmission, provided other public health guidance is followed. Alberta Health will continue to monitor case numbers and adjust as necessary.
For more information on outdoor and indoor gathering restrictions, visit alberta.ca/restrictions-on-gatherings.
General relaunch guidance, including sector-specific recommendations, can be found at alberta.ca/guidance-documents.

La limite des rassemblements en plein air est passée de 100 à 200 personnes.
Cette augmentation s'applique aux participants d’événements communautaires en plein air tels que les festivals, les feux d'artifice, les rodéos et les événements sportifs, ainsi qu'aux spectacles à l’extérieur.
Toutes les mesures de santé publique, y compris l'éloignement physique, restent en place. Pour les événements extérieurs où les participants sont assis, la distance nécessaire entre les familles et les cohortes devra être respectée dans les gradins.
Tout grand rassemblement augmente le risque de transmission. Les études montrent que les événements en plein air présentent un risque de transmission plus faible, à condition que les autres recommandations de santé publique soient suivies. Le ministère de la Santé de l'Alberta continuera de surveiller le nombre de cas et de procéder aux ajustements nécessaires.

Following the initial economic devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented crash in oil prices, the Government of Alberta is stepping forward with a plan to address both the short-term and long-term challenges facing our province. It is a plan to create jobs now that will set Alberta on a path for economic growth, diversification and renewal for the future.

“Albertans have risen to the challenge of the pandemic, though we will continue to be careful, especially for those who are most at risk. Now we must extend that same culture of resilience to overcoming the greatest economic challenge of our time. Today, we take a big step forward in that journey with the launch of Alberta’s Recovery Plan, a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build our province, to diversify our economy, and to create jobs.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Alberta’s Recovery Plan includes the many government relief programs that we have put in place to support Albertans and Alberta job creators through the COVID-19 pandemic. It also builds on strategic investments already underway, including the Keystone XL pipeline and $1 billion in accelerated Capital Maintenance and Renewal funding, which are putting thousands of Albertans to work this summer. The plan will continue under three main pillars: creating jobs, building infrastrtucture that will spur ecnomic growth, and continuing to diversify our economy.
Building: Investing in Infrastructure
This year Alberta will see the largest ever investment in the province’s infrastructure, with $10 billion being spent on projects in every corner of the province, creating 50,000 jobs. Government is taking unprecedented actions to create immediate jobs in ways that build communities for a bigger, brighter future and support long-term private sector job creation. Workers will be getting back on the job of building facilities, repairing roads and preparing Alberta to be stronger than ever.
Strategic projects
In a major new initiative, the government will launch a series of large-scale infrastructure projects this summer at a total cost of $612 million. These projects are designed to create at least 2,500 jobs and the projects have been chosen to improve long-term economic growth and to encourage investment across the province.
These strategic projects will be spread across every region of the province, and will include the twinning of highways, projects that support growth in the agricultural sector, gas line extensions for northern residents, treatment facilities for Albertans recovering from addictions, and other important projects. The projects announced today will be followed by more projects announced in the coming months that will drive economic expansion and provide a legacy that will benefit our province for decades to come.
Creating jobs
Strong economic fundamentals are reinforced in Alberta’s Recovery Plan with the immediate acceleration of the Job Creation Tax Cut. On July 1, the corporate income tax rate will drop to eight per cent – a year and a half sooner than promised. Government is also doubling down on its commitment to reduce red tape by ensuring government processes and regulations in the province do not constrain growth.

“The Job Creation Tax Cut is essential to Alberta’s recovery, ensuring our province has a competitive tax regime for job creators. When Alberta’s corporate income tax rate hits eight per cent, British Columbia’s corporate income tax will be 50 per cent higher at 12 per cent. As employers work to recover from COVID-19 they can be confident that Alberta will be the best place in Canada – by far – to locate, bringing with them jobs and prosperity.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

Innovation Employment Grant
We are also introducing an Innovation Employment Grant targeted to smaller companies and encouraging technology and investment in Alberta. It will provide a refundable tax credit to companies that invest in research and development, leaving them more money to employ Albertans in areas of innovation. With the Innovation Employment Grant, Alberta-based companies will have a competitive advantage at every stage in their development. During pre-income and scale-up phases, companies will benefit from this program, and as they become profitable and no longer qualify for the grant, they will benefit from the Job Creation Tax Cut.
Putting Albertans first
We will put Albertans, including recently arrived new Canadians, first for available jobs by asking the federal government to remove most occupational categories under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program for Alberta. At the same time, we will help employers connect with unemployed Albertans, making job training programs more responsive, and accelerating the Fairness for Newcomers Action Plan to put new Albertans who are already here to work faster in jobs that reward their skills and training.  
Due to the impairment of international travel, and the deep jobs crisis, government will also reduce by at least one-third this year’s targeted admissions under the Alberta Immigration Nominee Program, while moving ahead with key platform commitments like the Foreign Graduate Startup Visa Program to support growth in the tech and innovation sectors. This reflects evidence that newcomers who arrive during economic recessions do less well economically in the short term and for the rest of their careers. When economic conditions improve and employment rises, we will return to previous levels.
Supporting arts and culture
We will create a Cultural Event Relaunch Program to support music, performing arts and landmark events which have been especially hard-hit by public health measures. This program will help those events which may relaunch in the summer address physical distancing requirements, or relaunch as strong as ever in the next season. The government has also committed to growing Alberta’s cultural industries by 25 per cent to $1.5 billion in the next decade.
Municipal infrastructure
Funding for strategic projects is supplemented by increased funding for municipal programs.
In addition to the $50 million announced for municipalities through the Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program (STIP) to fund bridge improvements, upgrades to roads and community airports and other initiatives and a further $150 million for water infrastructure grants through the Alberta Municipal Water/Wastewater Partnership, we have identified up to $500 million in further funding for municipalities, funding we expect will be matched by Ottawa. Even before the federal contribution, this represents an increase to municipal infrastructure funding of almost 30 per cent in the current fiscal year.
It is estimated this new $500 million will support the creation of at least 2,500 jobs – immediate new jobs for projects that support people in the communities where they live, and drive future economic growth in the province.
Diversifying the economy
Sector strategies
Alberta’s Recovery Plan will focus on sector strategies for diversifying the economy. Building on our advantages in energy, agriculture, technology and tourism, these strategies will serve to support growth in other high-opportunity sectors such as value-added petrochemical manufacturing, minerals, including rare earth minerals, pharmaceuticals, the financial sector, logistics and aviation. The details of these sector strategies will be announced this summer and fall.
Technology
Government is also announcing its commitment to diversification through a re-capitalization of the Alberta Enterprise Corporation (AEC). Government is investing $175 million over the next three years in capital funds that support the technology sector in Alberta.
Promoting Alberta
Government is establishing a new investment agency to help restore economic growth, create jobs, and diversify our economy.
The Invest Alberta corporation will boost investment attraction efforts in key markets with major partners around the globe. It will increase investment in Alberta’s primary industries – energy, agriculture, and tourism and encourage investment in our high-potential sectors, such as technology, aviation and aerospace, and financial services. Government has allocated $6 million annually for the next three years for its operations.
This funding is part of the $75 million allocated to implement the Investment and Growth Strategy over the next three years to rebuild Alberta’s reputation as a destination for business and investment.

“Altogether, this plan represents a bold statement of confidence in the future of Alberta. It is based on common sense, not ideology. It balances targeted government spending in areas like job-creating infrastructure with strong incentives for private sector growth, like the accelerated Job Creation Tax Cut and the expanded Red Tape Reduction initiative. It ensures a future for our largest industry – oil and gas – while boosting diversification in key growth sectors, like tech and innovation through the new Innovation Employment Grant, and the Alberta Enterprise Corporation.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Le plan de relance de l’Alberta présente la stratégie économique détaillée de la province, notamment un investissement record de 10 milliards de dollars dans l’infrastructure et un plan visant la création de 50 000 emplois cette année.
À la suite de la dévastation économique initiale causée par la pandémie de COVID-19 et de l’effondrement sans précédent des prix du pétrole, le gouvernement de l’Alberta présente un plan pour relever les défis à court et à long terme auxquels la province est confrontée. Il s’agit d’un plan visant à créer des emplois maintenant afin que l’Alberta assure des perspectives de croissance, de diversification et de renouveau économiques pour l’avenir.

« Les Albertains et les Albertaines ont relevé le défi de la pandémie, mais nous continuerons d’être prudents, surtout en ce qui concerne les citoyens qui sont les plus à risque. Nous devons maintenant faire preuve de la même résilience pour surmonter le plus grand défi économique de notre époque. Aujourd’hui, nous franchissons une étape importante de la reprise avec le lancement du plan de relance de l’Alberta, une stratégie audacieuse et ambitieuse à long terme visant à bâtir l’infrastructure de la province, diversifier notre économie et créer des emplois. »
Jason Kenney, premier ministre

Le plan de relance de l’Alberta comprend les nombreux programmes d’aide gouvernementaux que nous avons mis en place pour soutenir la population albertaine et les créateurs d’emplois de l’Alberta pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Ce plan s’appuie également sur des investissements stratégiques déjà en cours, notamment le pipeline Keystone XL et un financement accéléré de 1 milliard de dollars pour l’entretien et le renouvellement des immobilisations, permettant à des milliers d’Albertains et d’Albertaines de travailler cet été. Le plan se poursuivra avec trois piliers principaux : la création d’emplois, la construction d’infrastructures pour stimuler la croissance économique et la poursuite de la diversification de notre économie.
Bâtir : Investir dans l’infrastructure
Cette année, l’Alberta verra le plus important investissement jamais réalisé dans l’infrastructure de la province, avec 10 milliards de dollars investis dans des projets à l’échelle de la province, grâce à la création de 50 000 emplois. Le gouvernement prend des mesures sans précédent pour créer immédiatement des emplois assurant un meilleur avenir pour les collectivités et soutenir la création d’emplois à long terme dans le secteur privé. Les travailleurs reprendront la construction d’installations, la réparation des routes et ils contribueront à faire de l’Alberta une province plus forte que jamais.
Projets stratégiques
Dans le cadre d’une nouvelle initiative majeure, le gouvernement lancera cet été une série de projets d’infrastructure à grande échelle pour un coût total de 612 millions de dollars. Ces projets sont destinés à créer au moins 2 500 emplois et les projets ont été choisis pour améliorer la croissance économique à long terme et encourager les investissements dans toute la province.
Ces projets stratégiques seront répartis dans toutes les régions de la province et comprendront l’élargissement à quatre voies d’autoroutes, des projets qui appuient la croissance dans le secteur agricole, des prolongements de conduites de gaz pour les résidents du Nord, des centres de traitement pour les Albertains et les Albertaines qui se remettent d’une toxicomanie et d’autres projets importants. Les projets annoncés aujourd’hui seront suivis par d’autres qui seront annoncés au cours des prochains mois, qui stimuleront l’expansion économique et assureront des retombées durables qui profiteront à notre province pendant des dizaines d’années.
Créer des emplois
Des bases économiques solides sont renforcées dans le plan de relance de l’Alberta avec l’accélération immédiate de la baisse d’impôt pour la création d’emplois. Le 1er juillet, le taux d’imposition des sociétés sera réduit pour s’établir à 8 %; un an et demi plus tôt que prévu. Le gouvernement renforce également son engagement à réduire les formalités administratives en veillant à ce que les processus et les règlements gouvernementaux de la province ne freinent pas la croissance.

« La réduction d’impôt pour la création d’emplois est essentielle à la reprise de l’Alberta, car elle garantit à notre province un régime fiscal concurrentiel pour les créateurs d’emplois. Lorsque le taux de l’impôt sur le revenu des sociétés de l’Alberta atteindra 8 %, l’impôt sur le revenu des sociétés de la Colombie-Britannique sera de 12 %, ce qui est 50 % plus élevé. Alors que les employeurs s’efforcent de se redresser par suite de la COVID-19, ils peuvent être certains que l’Alberta sera de loin le meilleur endroit au Canada pour s’installer, leur offrant emplois et prospérité. »
Travis Toews, président du Conseil du Trésor de l’Alberta et ministre des Finances

Subvention à l’emploi pour l’innovation
Nous introduisons également une subvention à l’emploi pour l’innovation destinée aux petites entreprises et nous encourageons les technologies et l’investissement en Alberta. Cette subvention sera un crédit d’impôt remboursable accordé aux entreprises qui investissent dans la recherche et le développement, leur laissant plus d’argent pour embaucher des Albertains et des Albertaines dans les domaines de l’innovation. Grâce à la subvention à l’emploi pour l’innovation, les entreprises établies en Alberta bénéficieront d’un avantage concurrentiel à chaque étape de leur croissance. Pendant les phases d’avant revenu et d’expansion, les entreprises bénéficieront de ce programme et, à mesure qu’elles deviendront rentables et ne pourront plus bénéficier de la subvention, elles bénéficieront de la réduction d’impôt pour la création d’emplois.
Priorité aux Albertains et Albertaines
Nous placerons les Albertains et les Albertaines, y compris les nouveaux arrivants au Canada, au premier rang des emplois offerts en demandant au gouvernement fédéral de supprimer la plupart des catégories professionnelles du Programme des travailleurs étrangers temporaires pour l’Alberta. De même, nous aiderons les employeurs à établir des liens avec les Albertains et les Albertaines au chômage, en faisant en sorte que les programmes de formation professionnelle soient plus adaptés et en accélérant le plan d’action pour l’équité envers les nouveaux arrivants pour que les nouveaux Albertains et les nouvelles Albertaines qui sont déjà dans la province puissent travailler plus rapidement dans des emplois qui récompensent leurs compétences et leur formation.
En raison de la diminution des voyages internationaux et de la crise profonde en matière d’emploi, le gouvernement réduira également d’au moins un tiers les admissions ciblées cette année dans le cadre du programme des candidats à l’immigration de l’Alberta. Des engagements clés de la plateforme, comme le programme de visa pour les jeunes diplômés étrangers, seront toutefois respectés afin de soutenir la croissance dans les secteurs de la technologie et de l’innovation. Nous devons tenir compte du fait que les nouveaux arrivants qui arrivent en période de récession économique s’en sortent moins bien sur le plan économique à court terme et tout au long du reste de leur carrière. Lorsque les conditions économiques s’amélioreront et que l’emploi repartira à la hausse, nous reviendrons aux niveaux précédents.
Soutenir les arts et la culture
Nous allons créer un programme de relance des événements culturels pour soutenir la musique, les arts du spectacle et les événements marquants qui ont été particulièrement touchés par les mesures de santé publique. Ce programme aidera les organisateurs d’événements susceptibles d’être relancés pendant l’été à répondre aux exigences d’éloignement physique ou à reprendre comme avant la crise lors de la prochaine saison. Le gouvernement s’est également engagé à faire croître les industries culturelles de l’Alberta de 25 %, visant des retombées de 1,5 milliard de dollars au cours des 10 prochaines années.
Infrastructure municipale
Le financement des projets stratégiques est complété par une augmentation du financement des programmes municipaux.
En plus des 50 millions de dollars annoncés pour les municipalités dans le cadre du Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program (programme des infrastructures stratégiques de transport) pour financer l’amélioration des ponts, la modernisation des routes et des aéroports communautaires et d’autres initiatives, ainsi que des 150 millions de dollars supplémentaires de subventions à l’appui des infrastructures d’eau dans le cadre du partenariat Alberta Municipal Water/Wastewater Partnership (partenariat relatif aux réseaux municipaux d’eau potable et d’eaux usées), nous avons cerné jusqu’à 500 millions de dollars de financement supplémentaire pour les municipalités, financement qui devrait être jumelé par Ottawa. Même avant la contribution fédérale, cela représente une augmentation de près de 30 % du financement des infrastructures municipales au cours de l’exercice courant.
On estime que ce nouveau montant de 500 millions de dollars permettra d’appuyer la création d’au moins 2 500 emplois; de nouveaux emplois immédiats pour des projets qui soutiennent les personnes dans leurs collectivités, et qui sont le moteur de la croissance économique future de la province.
Diversifier l’économie
Stratégies sectorielles
Le plan de relance de l’Alberta mettra l’accent sur les stratégies sectorielles de diversification de l’économie. S’appuyant sur nos atouts en matière d’énergie, d’agriculture, de technologie et de tourisme, ces stratégies serviront à soutenir la croissance dans d’autres secteurs à fort potentiel tels que la fabrication de produits pétrochimiques à valeur ajoutée, les minéraux, notamment les minéraux de terres rares, les produits pharmaceutiques, le secteur financier, la logistique et l’aviation. Les détails de ces stratégies sectorielles seront annoncés cet été et cet automne.
Technologie
Le gouvernement annonce également son engagement en faveur de la diversification au moyen d’une recapitalisation d’Alberta Enterprise Corporation. Le gouvernement investira 175 millions de dollars au cours des trois prochaines années dans des fonds d’immobilisations qui soutiennent le secteur technologique en Alberta.
Promouvoir l’Alberta
Le gouvernement est en train de créer une nouvelle agence d’investissement pour aider à relancer la croissance économique, à créer des emplois et à diversifier notre économie.
La société Invest Alberta intensifiera les efforts déployés pour attirer des investissements sur les marchés clés avec des partenaires majeurs du monde entier. Elle augmentera les investissements dans les industries primaires de l’Alberta (l’énergie, l’agriculture et le tourisme) et encouragera les investissements dans nos secteurs à fort potentiel, comme la technologie, l’aviation et l’aérospatiale et les services financiers. Le gouvernement a attribué 6 millions de dollars annuellement pour les trois prochaines années pour ses activités.
Ce financement fait partie des 75 millions de dollars attribués à la mise en œuvre de la stratégie d’investissement et de croissance au cours des trois prochaines années pour rebâtir la réputation de l’Alberta en tant que destination d’affaires et d’investissement.

« Dans l’ensemble, ce plan représente une audacieuse déclaration de confiance dans l’avenir de l’Alberta. Il est fondé sur le bon sens et non sur une idéologie. Il établit un équilibre entre les dépenses publiques ciblées dans des domaines tels que les infrastructures créatrices d’emplois et les fortes incitations à la croissance du secteur privé, comme la réduction accélérée de l’impôt pour la création d’emplois et l’initiative élargie de réduction des formalités administratives. Il assure un avenir à notre plus grande industrie, les hydrocarbures, tout en stimulant la diversification dans des secteurs de croissance clés, comme la technologie et l’innovation grâce à la nouvelle subvention à l’emploi pour l’innovation, et à Alberta Enterprise Corporation. »
Jason Kenney, premier ministre

Until now, Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba had separate processes and systems for corporations and limited partnerships to complete their extra-provincial business registrations and maintenance filings. On June 27, the four provinces were the first to implement the online Multi-jurisdictional Registry Access Service (MRAS), a hub that allows corporate information sharing between the provinces, making extra-provincial registration faster and easier.

“The launch of this online service is just one of the ways we are cutting red tape for businesses, which is especially important as we relaunch our economy. MRAS is convenient and efficient, and makes it easier for Alberta job creators to expand their operations across Western Canada and for western Canadian job creators to grow into Alberta.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta

As members of the New West Partnership Trade Agreement, the four western provinces committed to reconciling business registration and reporting requirements between the jurisdictions, thus simplifying extra-provincial business registration processes.

“We are always pleased to reduce red tape and make it easier for businesses to register and set up operations in Saskatchewan and Western Canada.”
Don Morgan, Minister of Justice and Attorney General, Government of Saskatchewan

Through MRAS, other jurisdictions will eventually be able to share corporate information, thus extending the New West Partnership’s efficiencies across Canada.

 “Manitoba is eager to work with our western neighbours under the New West Partnership Agreement and find ways to make life easier for business owners. A priority for our government is to reduce red tape and this is another way we are able to do so and improve economic trade across Western Canada.”
Scott Fielding, Minister of Finance, Province of Manitoba


“People using this new service will find it easier to register their business in multiple provinces, and efficiently complete necessary paperwork through one central hub. This joint effort under the New West Partnership Agreement streamlines trade between our provinces and opens up the possibility of including other provinces and territories in the future.”
Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services, Province of British Columbia 


“We are pleased to see the western provinces move ahead with the Multi-jurisdictional Registry Access Service and reduce the regulatory burden on businesses who operate within different provinces. Today’s announcement is one step in the right direction on creating a more open interprovincial trade environment in Canada. It is encouraging to see these provinces move on this key recommendation CFIB made to the Canada Free Trade Agreement.”
Marilyn Braun-Pollon, vice-president, Western Canada & Agri-business, CFIB   

Quick facts

MRAS allows jurisdictions to share corporate information so corporations and limited partnerships can complete and update their extra-provincial registration online.
MRAS also includes a national corporate registry search tool, which provides core registration information for corporations and extra-provincial corporations.
At this time, MRAS is not available for limited liability partnerships and cooperatives. These filings will continue to be completed through the current model.

The Small and Medium Enterprise Relaunch Grant offers financial assistance to Alberta businesses, cooperatives, and non-profit organizations that faced restrictions or closures from public health orders, and experienced a revenue loss of at least 50 per cent due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Eligible job creators can apply for up to $5,000 through this program.
This relief for businesses and non-profits can be used to offset the costs they are facing as they reopen their doors. This includes the costs of implementing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as physical barriers, PPE and cleaning supplies, as well as rent, employee wages, replacing inventory and more.

“Small- and medium-sized businesses are job creators. They employ hundreds of thousands of Albertans and are the backbone of our economy. That’s why we are taking further action to support them as we relaunch our economy and get folks back to work. This builds on Alberta’s nation-leading support for job creators, and will help businesses, cooperatives and non-profits get Albertans working and our economy back on track.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism


“We continue to hear from small businesses that although they are now fully open, it is not business as usual – with only 20 per cent making normal or better revenues for this time of year. This program will help small businesses in the economic relaunch phase who are struggling to pay for fixed costs such as rent and additional new costs like PPE.”
Annie Dormuth, Alberta provincial affairs director, Canadian Federation of Independent Business


“Businesses continue to struggle with the additional costs of getting their businesses – and therefore Alberta’s economy – back up and running. This grant program is very much appreciated and welcomed by small- and medium-sized businesses.”
Ken Kobly, president and CEO, Alberta Chambers of Commerce


“Prior to COVID-19, our Thursday buffet was our busiest day. With the help of the funding, we plan to purchase equipment to turn our self-serve buffet into a closed buffet so we can continue to offer this experience to our guests, just with adjustments to serving style.”
Done Philip, owner, PDS Restaurant in Brooks


“We will be using the funds to purchase personal protective equipment for our staff and facilities to ensure our customers feel safe when they come back to our businesses.”
Peter and Kamal Sandhu, owners, Care Edmonton Inc., and Care Beauty Spa & Hair Inc. in Edmonton

To be eligible, small- and medium-sized businesses, cooperatives and non-profits must have 500 or fewer employees.
The program has a budget of $200 million.
Application intake will open at 10 a.m. on June 29, and remain open until Aug. 31, or for four weeks following the start of stage three of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy – whichever is later.
To manage the expected volume of applications, during the first week of application intake (June 29 to July 3), a specific application day has been designated for specific regions of the province. During this time, applicants are encouraged to apply on the application day that is specified for their region. Beginning July 4,
businesses, cooperatives and non-profits from all regions may apply at any time until application intake closes.
Full program details, including additional eligibility criteria, application days by region, and how to apply, are outlined in the program guidelines.
A program web page and online application portal will launch on alberta.ca when application intake opens at 10 a.m. on June 29.
Quick facts

Many businesses have experienced a dramatic decrease in revenues, while other businesses have temporarily ceased operations as a result of COVID-19.
An Alberta Chambers of Commerce survey conducted in May found that affordability of PPE and sanitization materials is an issue for 22 per cent of businesses.

Dès le 29 juin, les petites et moyennes entreprises, les coopératives et les organismes sans but lucratif admissibles peuvent présenter une demande de financement afin d’ouvrir leurs portes et de permettre aux Albertains et aux Albertaines de retourner travail.
La subvention pour la relance des petites et moyennes entreprises est une aide financière aux entreprises, coopératives et organismes sans but lucratif de l’Alberta qui ont été soumis à des restrictions et à des fermetures imposées par des ordonnances de santé publique et ont subi une perte de revenus d’au moins 50 % en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19.
Les créateurs d’emplois admissibles peuvent demander jusqu’à 5 000 $ au titre de ce programme.
Cette aide aux entreprises et aux organismes sans but lucratif peut être utilisée pour compenser les coûts associés à la reprise de leurs activités. Il s’agit notamment des coûts des mesures visant à prévenir la propagation de la COVID-19, comme les barrières physiques, l’équipement de protection individuelle, les fournitures de nettoyage, les loyers, les salaires des employés, le remplacement des stocks, etc.

« Les propriétaires de petites et moyennes entreprises créent des emplois. Ils emploient des centaines de milliers d’Albertains et d’Albertaines et constituent le pilier de notre économie. C’est pourquoi nous prenons des mesures supplémentaires pour les soutenir dans le cadre de la relance notre économie et du retour au travail de la population active. Cette démarche vient renforcer le soutien que l’Alberta accorde aux créateurs d’emplois, l’un des plus importants au pays. Les Albertains et les Albertaines pourront ainsi reprendre le travail dans ces entreprises, coopératives et organismes sans but lucratif et contribuer au rétablissement de l’économie. »
Tanya Fir, ministre du Développement économique, du Commerce et du Tourisme


« Les propriétaires de petites entreprises continuent de nous dire que, malgré la reprise complète de leurs activités, tout n’est pas comme avant, car seulement 20 % d’entre eux enregistrent des recettes normales ou supérieures pour cette période de l’année. Ce programme aidera les propriétaires de petites entreprises en phase de relance économique qui peinent à payer des coûts fixes comme leur loyer et des coûts supplémentaires inédits comme l’équipement de protection individuelle. »
Annie Dormuth, directrice des affaires provinciales de l’Alberta, Fédération canadienne de l’entreprise indépendante


« Les propriétaires d’entreprises peinent encore à assumer les coûts supplémentaires associés à la reprise de leurs activités, et donc de l’économie de l’Alberta. Ce programme de subventions est très apprécié et accueilli favorablement par les propriétaires de petites et moyennes entreprises. »
Ken Kobly, premier dirigeant, Alberta Chambers of Commerce (chambre de commerce de l’Alberta)


« Avant la pandémie de COVID-19, notre buffet du jeudi correspondant à notre journée la plus chargée. Grâce au financement, nous allons acheter du matériel pour transformer notre buffet libre-service en buffet fermé afin de pouvoir continuer à proposer cette expérience à nos clients, tout en adaptant le style de notre service. »
Done Philip, propriétaire, PDS Restaurant à Brooks


« Nous utiliserons les fonds pour acheter de l’équipement de protection individuelle pour notre personnel et nos installations, afin que nos clients se sentent en sécurité lorsqu’ils reviendront dans nos établissements. »
Peter et Kamal Sandhu, propriétaires, Care Edmonton Inc. et Care Beauty Spa & Hair Inc. à Edmonton

Pour être admissibles, les petites et moyennes entreprises, les coopératives et les organismes sans but lucratif doivent compter 500 employés ou moins.
Le programme dispose d’un budget de 200 millions de dollars.
Les demandes pourront être déposées à partir de 10 h le 29 juin et jusqu’au 31 août, ou pendant quatre semaines après le début de la troisième étape de la Stratégie de relance de l’Alberta, selon la date la plus tardive.
Pour gérer le volume prévu de demandes, chaque journée de la première semaine du programme (du 29 juin au 3 juillet) sera consacrée aux demandes émanant de régions précises de la province. Pendant cette période, les entreprises sont encouragées à déposer leur demande le jour réservé à leur région. À partir du 4 juillet,
les entreprises, les coopératives et les organismes sans but lucratif de toutes les régions pourront déposer leur demande à tout moment, et ce, jusqu’à la clôture de la période de présentation des demandes.
Les détails complets du programme, y compris les critères d’admissibilité supplémentaires, les dates réservées aux régions et les modalités de dépôt des demandes, sont précisés dans les lignes directrices du programme (en anglais seulement).
Une page Web sur programme et un portail de demande en ligne seront lancés dans alberta.ca lorsque la réception des demandes débutera à 10 h le 29 juin.
En bref

De nombreuses entreprises ont connu une baisse spectaculaire de leurs revenus, tandis que d’autres ont temporairement cessé leurs activités en raison de la COVID-19.
Une enquête de l’Alberta Chambers of Commerce menée en mai a permis de révéler que le prix de l’équipement de protection individuelle et du matériel d’assainissement était un problème pour 22 % des entreprises.

“This is the first time in 25 years that the Government of Alberta has a ministry dedicated to multiculturalism, because we understand that our diversity makes us stronger. Our focus on multiculturalism encourages Albertans to learn more about each other, celebrate our cultural diversity, and acknowledge the work that must be done to fight racism and build a province where all people feel safe, welcome and valued.
“Multiculturalism and anti-racism work hand in hand to target the root causes of discrimination: fear of the unknown and intolerance. By learning more about the diverse cultures in Alberta, we discover unity in our shared values. After all, we all want a safe home for our families and the opportunity to succeed.
“Recent events have shown us that this is especially important in addressing the barriers that exist in our workplaces, schools and public spaces.
“On Canadian Multiculturalism Day, I encourage all Albertans to celebrate their heritage and share their traditions. This kind of sharing helps create connections and strong communities, which will be crucial for us in ending the scourge of racism and working together to continue to build a strong, resilient, and compassionate future for our province.”

Madame Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine, a fait la déclaration suivante à l'occasion de la Journée canadienne du multiculturalisme :
« C'est la première fois en 25 ans que le gouvernement de l'Alberta compte un ministère consacré au multiculturalisme, car ce gouvernement a compris que notre diversité nous rend plus forts. L'accent que nous mettons sur le multiculturalisme encourage les Albertains et les Albertaines à mieux se connaître, à célébrer leur diversité culturelle et à reconnaître le travail qui doit être accompli pour vaincre le racisme et bâtir une province où tous et toutes se sentent valorisés, en sécurité et les bienvenus.
« Le multiculturalisme et la lutte contre le racisme travaillent main dans la main pour s’attaquer aux causes profondes de la discrimination, c’est-à-dire la peur de l'inconnu et l'intolérance. En apprenant à mieux connaître les diverses cultures de l'Alberta, nous découvrons des valeurs communes qui nous unissent. Tout ce que nous voulons tous et toutes, après tout, c’est un foyer sécuritaire pour nos familles et une chance de réussir.
« Les événements récents nous ont montré que cela est particulièrement important pour lever les obstacles qui existent dans nos lieux de travail, nos écoles et nos espaces publics.
« En cette Journée canadienne du multiculturalisme, j'encourage tous les Albertains et toutes les Albertaines à célébrer leur héritage et à partager leurs traditions. Ce partage contribue à créer des liens et des communautés fortes, éléments cruciaux pour l’ensemble de notre population dans la lutte contre le fléau du racisme et dans la collaboration qui nous permettra de bâtir un avenir sûr, rempli de résilience et de compassion, pour notre province. »

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Anyone can become ill from this virus. Older Albertans and those with heart disease, diabetes or other underlying medical conditions are the most at risk of experiencing severe health outcomes.
To date, 139 of the 154 deaths reported in Alberta were individuals over the age of 70. Almost 90 per cent of those who died from COVID-19 had two or more underlying conditions.

“Albertans have faced COVID-19 as they do any other obstacle –  head-on, with grit and determination. Our government will continue providing unprecedented support for vulnerable groups, but we need everyone to act responsibly and encourage others to do the same. Simple actions save lives, so let’s all keep doing our part.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“COVID-19 is still a threat to Alberta. We are extending critical supports put in place to protect those most at risk, including residents in continuing care facilities. This includes provincewide funding to help cover costs arising from COVID-19 protective measures and help seniors to remain safe at home.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“Every one of us acts as a shield that protects our friends, families and neighbours from this virus. By taking simple, everyday actions, we can help limit the spread, particularly to those most at risk of COVID-19. Every time we step out the door, we should ask ourselves: ‘Who am I protecting today?’”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health

Strong protections across the province
Government is extending the robust supports put in place during the spring to protect at-risk Albertans.
This includes $14.2 million a month – and more than $170 million total – in additional funding to help keep residents and staff safe in long-term care, designated supportive living facilities and seniors lodges. Funding will continue until the orders from Alberta's chief medical officer of health are lifted. It is being distributed in coordination with Alberta Health Services and Seniors and Housing.
Operators are using this money to pay for enhanced staffing and extra cleaning supplies, and to address lost accommodation revenue. Long-term care and designated supportive living operators have already received $38.7 million.
The wage top-up of an additional $2 per hour for health-care aides at contracting continuing care facilities will also continue, along with funds to increase staffing levels, at a cost of $7.3 million a month.
Other recent investments for at-risk Albertans include:

$500 million in additional funding for Budget 2020 to support Alberta’s health system during the pandemic.


$30 million to charities, not-for-profits, food banks and civil society organizations to support their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
$25 million to expand shelter space across the province to protect Albertans experiencing homelessness and allow for physical distancing.
$21.6 million to expand online resources and virtual supports for Albertans seeking help for mental health and addiction challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
$5 million for women’s emergency shelters to support women and children fleeing violence to ensure they are protected and have access to safe isolation with supports.

Additional measures to support at-risk populations
A number of other targeted measures will also continue until further notice, including:

Asymptomatic testing for all Albertans, including at all locations with outbreaks and all continuing care facilities.
Mandatory protections for staff and residents at continuing care facilities, including continuous staff masking, staff screening, and restrictions on staff working at more than one facility.
Enhanced outbreak protocols and infection prevention and control measures for all continuing care facilities and independent seniors living facilities.
Strengthened protections at residential addiction treatment facilities, including screening protocols for residents and staff, enhanced cleaning and outbreak reporting requirements.
Almost 20 million free non-medical masks distributed to Albertans in June, with another 20 million to be released in July.
Expanded monitoring of licensed supportive living and long-term care settings to ensure compliance to protocols and standards.

Government is now engaging with those most at risk of severe outcomes to hear their ideas on what restrictions can be safely relaxed while still protecting them from infection. This includes seniors, senior-serving organizations, and disability groups.
Remember who you’re protecting
While these measures are vital, the most effective way to protect at-risk individuals is through collective action that makes our communities safe for all.
Leaders from the worlds of sports, music, media, and government in Alberta have come together in a new video encouraging Albertans to ‘remember who you’re protecting.’
By taking simple, everyday actions, we can all protect our family, friends and neighbours, particularly those most at risk of COVID-19. Stay home if you are sick, get tested, practise physical distancing, wear a non-medical mask when you can’t, and wash your hands regularly.
Albertans who may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 can also take steps to protect themselves. Follow the public health guidance provided, and talk to your health-care provider about specific ways to support your well-being.
Quick facts about at-risk populations in Alberta

The average age of a death from COVID-19 is 83.
All Albertans over the age of 80 face the same risk of death from a COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether they live in continuing care or the community.

Le gouvernement demande à l’ensemble des Albertains et des Albertaines de ne pas oublier qui ils protègent contre la COVID-19.
N’importe qui peut tomber malade à cause du virus de la COVID-19. Les personnes âgées et celles souffrant de maladies cardiaques, de diabète ou d’autres problèmes de santé sous-jacents sont les plus à risque de souffrir de graves problèmes de santé.
À ce jour, 139 des 154 personnes décédées recensées en Alberta avaient plus de 70 ans. Près de 90 % des personnes décédées de la COVID-19 souffraient de deux affections sous-jacentes ou plus.

« La population albertaine a abordé la COVID-19 comme elle l’aurait fait pour toute autre épreuve, c’est-à-dire de front, avec courage et détermination. Notre gouvernement continuera d’apporter un soutien sans précédent aux groupes vulnérables, mais nous avons besoin que chacun agisse de manière responsable et encourage les autres à faire de même. Des actions simples sauvent des vies, alors continuons de collaborer. »
Jason Kenney, premier ministre


« La COVID-19 est toujours une menace pour l’Alberta. Nous étendons les mesures de soutien critiques mises en place pour protéger les personnes les plus à risque, y compris les résidents des établissements de soins de longue durée. Elles comprennent un financement provincial destiné à prendre en charge une partie des coûts engendrés par les mesures de protection contre la COVID-19 et à aider les personnes âgées à rester chez elles en sécurité. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé


« Chacun de nous est un rempart qui protège ses amis, sa famille et ses voisins contre le virus. En respectant des mesures simples au quotidien, nous pouvons aider à limiter la propagation de la COVID-19, en particulier chez les populations les plus à risque. Chaque fois que nous sortons, nous devrions nous demander qui nous protégeons aujourd’hui. »
Dre Deena Hinshaw, médecin-hygiéniste en chef

Des mesures de protection rigoureuses dans toute la province
Le gouvernement étend les mesures de soutien fortes prises au printemps pour protéger les Albertains et les Albertaines à risque.
Ces mesures comprennent 14,2 millions de dollars par mois – et plus de 170 millions de dollars au total – en fonds supplémentaires pour aider à assurer la sécurité des résidents et du personnel des établissements de soins de longue durée, des établissements d’aide à la vie autonome et des foyers pour personnes âgées. Le financement sera maintenu jusqu’à ce que les ordonnances de la médecin-hygiéniste en chef de l’Alberta soient levées. Les fonds sont distribués en coordination avec l’Alberta Health Services (services de santé de l’Alberta) et le ministère des Aînés et du Logement (Seniors and Housing).
Les exploitants utilisent ces fonds pour renforcer leurs effectifs et acheter des fournitures de nettoyage supplémentaires, mais aussi pour compenser la perte de revenus d’hébergement. Les exploitants des établissements de soins de longue durée et d’aide à la vie autonome ont déjà reçu 38,7 millions de dollars.
Le complément de salaire de 2 $ l’heure accordé aux préposés aux aides en soins de santé dans les établissements de soins de longue durée sera également maintenu, tout comme le financement destiné à soutenir l’augmentation des effectifs, pour un coût de 7,3 millions de dollars par mois.
D’autres investissements ont récemment été faits en faveur des Albertains et des Albertaines à risque :

500 millions de dollars de financement supplémentaire pour le budget de 2020 afin de soutenir le système de santé de l’Alberta pendant la pandémie;


30 millions de dollars pour des organismes de bienfaisance, des organismes sans but lucratif, des banques alimentaires et des organisations de la société civile pour appuyer leur lutte contre la pandémie de COVID-19;
25 millions de dollars pour mettre à disposition plus d’espace pour les refuges dans toute la province, afin de protéger les personnes sans abri et d’assurer l’éloignement physique;
21,6 millions de dollars pour élargir les ressources en ligne et les mesures de soutien virtuelles pour les Albertains et les Albertaines qui ont des problèmes de santé mentale et de toxicomanie en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19 et qui cherchent de l’aide;
5 millions de dollars pour les refuges d’urgence réservés aux femmes afin de protéger les femmes et les enfants fuyant la violence et de leur garantir un isolement sécuritaire avec du soutien.

Mesures supplémentaires en faveur des populations à risque
Plusieurs autres mesures ciblées seront également maintenues jusqu’à nouvel ordre, notamment :

les tests de dépistage pour toutes les personnes asymptomatiques, y compris partout où des éclosions se sont produites et dans tous les établissements de soins de longue durée;
les mesures de protection obligatoires pour le personnel et les résidents des établissements de soins de longue durée, y compris le port du masque en continu par le personnel, le dépistage du personnel et les restrictions imposées au personnel travaillant dans plusieurs établissements;
l’amélioration des protocoles en cas d’éclosion et des mesures de prévention et de contrôle des infections pour tous les établissements de soins de longue durée et les établissements pour personnes âgées autonomes;
le renforcement des mesures de protection dans les établissements résidentiels de traitement de la toxicomanie, y compris les protocoles de dépistage pour les résidents et le personnel, le renforcement des exigences de nettoyage et de déclaration des éclosions;
près de 20 millions de masques non médicaux gratuits ont été distribués à la population albertaine en juin, et 20 millions supplémentaires devraient être distribués en juillet;
la surveillance accrue des établissements agréés d’aide à la vie autonome et de soins de longue durée pour assurer la conformité aux protocoles et aux normes.

Les membres du gouvernement communiquent actuellement avec les personnes les plus à risque de contracter une infection grave pour recueillir leur avis sur les restrictions qui peuvent être assouplies en toute sécurité tout en les protégeant de l’infection. Cette initiative vise les aînés, les organisations de services aux aînés et les groupes de personnes en situation de handicap.
N’oubliez pas qui vous protégez
Bien que ces mesures soient essentielles, le moyen le plus efficace de protéger les personnes à risque est d’agir collectivement pour rendre nos collectivités sûres pour tous.
Des chefs de file du monde du sport, de la musique, des médias et du gouvernement de l’Alberta ont participé à la réalisation d’une nouvelle vidéo encourageant les Albertains et les Albertaines à ne pas oublier qui ils protègent.
En appliquant des mesures simples au quotidien, nous pouvons tous protéger notre famille, nos amis et nos voisins de la COVID-19, en particulier ceux qui sont le plus à risque. Restez chez vous si vous êtes malade, subissez un test de dépistage, respectez les consignes d’éloignement physique ou portez un masque non médical dans le cas contraire, et lavez-vous les mains régulièrement.
Les Albertains et les Albertaines qui pourraient être particulièrement vulnérables face à la COVID-19 peuvent également prendre des mesures pour se protéger. Suivez les consignes de santé publique qui vous sont données, et discutez avec votre professionnel de la santé des moyens précis de favoriser votre bien-être.
Quelques faits sur les populations à risque en Alberta

L’âge moyen des personnes décédées de la COVID-19 est de 83 ans.

The contract for the final portion of the West Calgary Ring Road has been awarded to Calgary Safelink Partners for
$277 million. Construction will get underway this summer on the south portion of the road, which is expected to be completed in 2024.

“The ring road is a critical project that has been years in the making and Calgarians have been waiting decades for it to be completed. When construction wraps up, the ring road will provide more than 100 kilometres of free-flow travel, making it faster and easier for Calgarians and job creators to get around Alberta’s largest city. Most importantly, this major infrastructure project will help get Albertans back to work by supporting thousands of much-needed jobs.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation


“I know I speak for myself and the constituents of Calgary-West when I say that the completion of the Calgary Ring Road has been highly anticipated in our riding. The Calgary Ring Road is a necessary project that will bring greater efficiency and free flow of traffic to our city, and I eagerly await the final phase to begin construction this summer.”
Mike Ellis, MLA for Calgary West


“This project is something that the people of Calgary-Bow have been looking forward to for some time. I am pleased to see that the final construction contract has been awarded and like many of my neighbours, I am eagerly looking forward to greater connectivity with the city and the province once the project has finished. Finishing the ring road will make life better for the people of Calgary-Bow.”
Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education and MLA for Calgary-Bow

Another milestone was recently marked by the completion of about 80 per cent of the Southwest Calgary Ring Road, which is on schedule to be completed in fall 2021. A portion of the road will open this fall.
Quick facts

Budget 2020 allocated about $1.4 billion for the Calgary Ring Road.
Once complete, the ring road will provide 101 kilometres of free-flow travel around Calgary, and its construction will support more than 8,000 jobs.

Southwest Calgary Ring Road

The Southwest Calgary Ring Road will connect Highway 8 and Macleod Trail.
Construction began in 2016 and will be completed in 2021.
A portion of the road between Glenmore Trail and Fish Creek Boulevard is expected to open to traffic in fall 2020.

West Calgary Ring Road

The West Calgary Ring Road connects Highway 8 and the Trans-Canada Highway.
The West Calgary Ring Road will be completed in three sections:
	
North project (Trans-Canada Highway to Old Banff Coach Road)
West Bow River Bridge project  
South project (Old Banff Coach Road to Highway 8)


The South project is targeted for completion in 2024 due to delays in relocating the ENMAX utility line, which required Alberta Utilities Commission approval, as well as considerations for the COVID19 pandemic.
Preparations for a new storm pond are complete, and girders have been installed on the new bridge for the Scenic Acres Link NW exit.
The new Bow River Pathway is now open, and work continues on the Trans-Canada Highway and Valley Ridge Boulevard NW interchange.

Stage two of relaunch underway

Stage two of Alberta’s relaunch strategy is underway.
More businesses, sport and recreation services are open. Some larger gatherings are permitted.
Public health guidance must be followed.
Stage three depends on success in stage two, determined by: active case numbers, infection rates, health-care system capacity based on numbers in hospital and intensive care.
For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.
The relaunch status map shows the level of risk in regions and information about local health measures. It also shows the rate of COVID-19 cases and the number of active cases.

Asymptomatic testing at community pharmacies

Participating community pharmacies will soon offer testing to Albertans without symptoms and no known exposure to COVID-19, making it easier to access testing and help stop the spread.
At first, the number of pharmacies offering testing is limited. People should call their pharmacy to find out if it offers testing, and to book a test.

Serology testing to track the spread

Alberta is investing $10 million in voluntary serology testing for targeted groups for past exposure.
This will help measure the virus spread among people who never felt sick, or didn’t report it.

Access to justice

The Court of Queen’s Bench is scheduling more previously postponed matters. For details, visit https://albertacourts.ca/qb/resources/announcements.

Supporting Alberta businesses through relaunch

The Alberta Biz Connect web page has health and safety guidelines for general workplaces and specific industry sectors. Businesses are encouraged to check for new and updated guidance documents.


A template on the website can help businesses plan how to protect employees and patrons from infection. Completing the template is voluntary.

Albertans downloading tracer app

The ABTraceTogether app enhances manual contact tracing and capacity, and facilitates early detection. It means Albertans will be contacted more quickly if they are at risk.
Use of the app is voluntary; users must opt in. The app currently has 216,280 registered users.
Privacy is protected. The app does not track a user’s physical location or use GPS. All contact data is only on the user’s phone and is deleted after 21 days.  
Secure contact tracing is a cornerstone of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy.

Mental health supports

Confidential supports are available to help with mental health concerns. The Mental Health Help Line at 1-877-303-2642 and the Addiction Help Line at 1-866-332-2322 operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Canadian Mental Health Association has resources at mentalhealthweek.ca.
The Kids Help Phone is available 24-7 and offers professional counselling, information and referrals and volunteer-led, text-based support to young people by texting CONNECT to 686868.
Online resources provide advice on handling stressful situations and ways to talk with children.

Family violence prevention

A 24-hour Family Violence Information Line at 310-1818 provides anonymous help in more than 170 languages.
Alberta’s One Line for Sexual Violence is available at 1-866-403-8000, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
People fleeing family violence can call local police or the nearest RCMP detachment to apply for an Emergency Protection Order. The requirement for in-person applications is temporarily suspended.
Information sheets and other resources on family violence prevention are at alberta.ca/COVID19.

Quick facts

Good hygiene is the most important measure to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.
	
Wash your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching your face, cough or sneeze into your elbow or sleeve, and dispose of tissues appropriately.


Albertans are asked to share acts of kindness they have experienced in their community during this difficult time by using the hashtag #AlbertaCares.
The Alberta Connects Contact Centre (310-4455) is available to Albertans Monday to Friday, from 8:15 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

“From Day 1, our government has strongly and consistently taken action to support and protect the interests of Albertans and our energy sector. This included launching a public inquiry into the existence of a well-funded foreign campaign aimed at discrediting Alberta’s energy sector – a campaign which is alleged to have robbed the people of Alberta of billions of dollars in lost revenues and thousands of jobs.
“The commissioner’s initial findings have shown that additional time and work is required to complete the final report. This extension will allow the commissioner to fairly and justly complete the inquiry process and follow up on the materials discovered to date. Due diligence cannot, and will not, be sacrificed on an issue this important to the future of our province and country.
“As such, we have extended the commissioner’s deadline to submit his final report from July 2 to Oct. 30. To align with this additional time, we are also re-allocating $1 million from the Canadian Energy Centre’s 2020-21 budget to complete the inquiry.
“How Alberta – and Canada – come through this economic crisis depends in large part on the survival and successful recovery of our energy sector. This sector helps some of our country’s most important industries thrive – including health care, manufacturing and transportation – and the revenue it generates supports the public services Canadians rely on. We look forward to the recommendations of the commissioner. We will do whatever it takes to support one of Canada’s most important industries, as we set a path towards economic recovery and renewed prosperity.”

A limited number of community pharmacies will begin to offer testing to Albertans without symptoms and no known exposure to COVID-19. This is in addition to the robust COVID-19 testing already offered by Alberta Health Services.
Alberta remains among the world leaders in COVID-19 testing per capita. More than 415,000 tests have been completed across the province.

“Alberta is a world leader in testing, and this will further expand our capacity. By gradually expanding COVID-19 testing in community pharmacies, we continue to put safety first as we reopen the economy and get Albertans back to work. This is a key part of Alberta's relaunch strategy and will help us continue protecting Albertans from this virus.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“Our testing data has shown that the vast majority of Albertans who have gone for testing without symptoms or known exposure to COVID have tested negative. This is encouraging. Whether you have symptoms or not, please consider getting tested. You are helping us understand more about the spread of COVID-19 in Alberta.” 
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health


 “Pharmacist practitioners prescribe, vaccinate, and will now be able to administer COVID-19 tests for asymptomatic individuals.  Pharmacists volunteering to offer COVID-19 testing further acknowledges the vital role they continue to play in the delivery of public health care, helping to keep our communities safe and enhancing the fight against COVID-19.”
Margaret Wing, CEO, Alberta Pharmacists’ Association

Over the next few days, a group of 20 community pharmacies located primarily in Edmonton and Calgary will begin to offer testing. The pharmacy test is a throat swab, which is sent to Alberta Precision Labs for analysis.
The number of pharmacies initially conducting COVID-19 testing is being limited to ensure the processes and flow of test materials and data is working well before expanding further. Additional pharmacies are planning to offer testing in the coming weeks.
Albertans are encouraged to talk to their local pharmacist to see if testing is available. Each participating pharmacy will adhere to strict protocols and has the specialized skills needed to protect patient safety. 
All Albertans are encouraged to be tested, even if they don't have symptoms. In addition to participating pharmacies, anyone who wants to get tested can book an appointment online with the AHS assessment tool.
Quick facts

Alberta has one of the highest COVID-19 testing rates in the world, and has performed more than 415,000 tests on more than 367,000 Albertans.
Only those who are asymptomatic and have no known exposures to COVID-19 can be tested at participating pharmacies.
Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms must complete the COVID-19 self-assessment or call Health Link 811.
Test kits for pharmacies are being produced and analyzed by Alberta Precision Laboratories.
AHS will directly contact any Albertan who tests positive to discuss the results, begin contact tracing and protect the public’s health.

L’Alberta offrira des tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 aux personnes asymptomatiques dans les pharmacies, ce qui permettra à la population albertaine d’accéder plus facilement aux tests et aidera à enrayer la propagation de la maladie.
Un nombre limité de pharmacies commenceront à offrir des tests de dépistage aux Albertains et aux Albertaines sans symptômes ni exposition connue à la COVID-19. Cette mesure vient s’ajouter aux tests de dépistage rigoureux déjà offerts par l’Alberta Health Services (services de santé de l’Alberta).
L’Alberta fait toujours partie des chefs de file mondiaux en matière de nombres de tests effectués en fonction du nombre d’habitants. Plus de 415 000 tests de dépistage ont déjà été effectués dans l’ensemble de la province.

« L’Alberta est un leadeur mondial en matière de tests de dépistage et cette mesure accroîtra davantage notre capacité. En élargissant progressivement les tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 aux pharmacies, nous continuons à accorder la priorité absolue à la sécurité, alors que nous relançons l’économie et que les Albertains et les Albertaines retournent au travail. Cette mesure est un élément clé de la stratégie de relance de l’Alberta qui nous aidera à continuer à protéger la population albertaine contre ce virus. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé


« Nos données sur les tests de dépistage ont montré que les tests étaient négatifs pour la grande majorité des Albertains et des Albertaines sans symptômes ou qui, à leur connaissance, n’avaient pas été exposés à la COVID. C’est encourageant. Que vous présentiez ou non des symptômes, envisagez de subir un test. Vous nous aidez à mieux comprendre la propagation de la COVID-19 en Alberta. »
Dre Deena Hinshaw, médecin-hygiéniste en chef


 « Les pharmaciens praticiens prescrivent, vaccinent et pourront désormais faire passer des tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 à des personnes asymptomatiques. Les pharmaciens qui se sont portés volontaires pour proposer des tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 reconnaissent, en outre, le rôle vital qu’ils continuent de jouer dans la prestation des soins de santé publique et qu’ils contribuent à assurer la sécurité de nos communautés et à renforcer la lutte contre la COVID-19. »
Margaret Wing, directrice générale, Alberta Pharmacists’ Association (association des pharmaciens de l’Alberta)

Dans les prochains jours, un groupe de 20 pharmacies situées principalement à Edmonton et à Calgary commenceront à offrir des tests de dépistage. Le test effectué en pharmacie est un prélèvement de la gorge qui est envoyé aux laboratoires Alberta Precision Laboratories aux fins d’analyse.
Avant de l’élargir davantage, nous limitons dans un premier temps le nombre de pharmacies effectuant les tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 afin de nous assurer du bon fonctionnement des processus de même que du flux de matériel nécessaire aux tests et des données qui y sont liées. D’autres pharmacies prévoient proposer des tests de dépistage au cours des prochaines semaines.
Les Albertains et les Albertaines sont encouragés à s’informer auprès de leur pharmacien local pour savoir s’il effectue des tests de dépistage. Chaque pharmacie participante respectera des protocoles stricts et possède les compétences spécialisées nécessaires pour protéger la sécurité des patients.
Tous les Albertains et toutes les Albertaines sont encouragés à subir un test, même s’ils ne présentent aucun symptôme. En plus des pharmacies participantes, toute personne qui souhaite subir un test peut prendre rendez-vous en ligne à l’aide de l’outil d’évaluation de l’Alberta Health Services (AHS assessment tool; en anglais seulement).
En bref

L’Alberta a l’un des taux de tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 les plus élevés au monde et a effectué plus de 415 000 tests de dépistage sur plus de 367 000 Albertains et Albertaines.
Seules les personnes asymptomatiques et sans exposition connue à la COVID-19 peuvent subir un test dans les pharmacies participantes.
Toute personne présentant des symptômes de la COVID-19 doit remplir l’outil d’auto-évaluation de la COVID-19 (en anglais seulement) ou appeler la ligne téléphonique Health Link 811.
Les trousses de tests de dépistage pour les pharmacies sont produites et analysées par les Alberta Precision Laboratories.
L’Alberta Health Services communiquera directement avec les Albertains et les Albertaines dont le test de dépistage est positif pour discuter des résultats, commencer la recherche des contacts et protéger la santé du public.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The program is being established to help affected citizens and the communities recover from uninsurable loss and damages caused by overland flooding from extraordinary rainfall on June 13.

“This is a difficult time for all Albertans, and to experience a significant disaster while dealing with a pandemic is nothing short of stressful. Our government is here to help support communities and Albertans recover by providing funding for uninsurable losses and damages.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

The funding will help communities recover from damages to infrastructure and property, and recover costs incurred during emergency operations, response and cleanup. Funding will also be available to residents and business owners for uninsurable losses caused by overland flooding.

“Government operates an objective process to determine DRP eligibility. Following that process, we are now in a position to move forward with disaster relief. This funding will help affected communities recover and rebuild from this disaster.”
Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs

MLAs have been working tirelessly to respond to damage on the ground and assist residents with filing their insurance claims.

“We know the damage from this storm has been devastating to Calgary and area residents. Our government will stand with you as we rebuild and manage the impact of this extreme weather. This disaster recovery assistance will provide some relief and make a positive difference for affected Albertans and their families.”
Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services

Uninsurable loss and damages
Only uninsurable costs are eligible for funding under the Disaster Assistance Guidelines. Hail, sewer backup and insurance deductibles do not qualify under the program, as insurance coverage is considered reasonably and readily available for these issues. Damages caused by overland flooding are eligible for a disaster recovery program, however.
Albertans are encouraged to work with their insurance providers for damages caused by the storm. For more information, call the Insurance Bureau of Canada at 1-844-227-5422, or visit them online.
Individuals who have not chosen to insure their property or belongings, or those who do not have adequate insurance, will not be eligible to receive funding through the disaster recovery program.
Information, application processes and updates on approved disaster recovery programs can be found online at Alberta.ca/DRP.
Quick facts

Flooding also affected public infrastructure, such as the Calgary International Airport and roadways, and damaged homes and small businesses.
There are many ways you can be prepared for an emergency. Start by going online for information on emergency preparedness and hazards in Alberta. Be sure you have the Alberta Emergency Alert app downloaded on your mobile device.

Premier Jason Kenney, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions Jason Luan, MLA for Leduc-Beaumont Brad Rutherford, Director of HiMARC Suzette Brémault-Phillips, and others, met with Edmonton Police Chief Dale McFee and AHS Director of EMS Operations Dale Weiss earlier this week to discuss mental health support for first responders.

Premier Jason Kenney and Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions Jason Luan held a roundtable discussion this week to raise awareness of first responder mental health for PTSD Awareness Month with representatives from local first responder agencies and the HiMARC organization.
HiMARC is receiving funding to develop web-based resources to build resilience among first responders and expand clinical trials using virtual reality to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among military members and veterans to a sample of other first responders, including law enforcement and health-care providers.

“First responders such as military members, law enforcement and other emergency services members have been on the front lines of our pandemic response. We are pleased to support HiMARC’s important work providing a platform for members of these groups to develop and practise resilience skills.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Many Albertans need additional mental health supports during the pandemic, but none more so than our first responders. Our government is proud to support this program that seeks to provide resources and learning opportunities to help first responders and military members be ready to respond to emergencies at a moment’s notice.”
Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions


“Edmonton Police Service members have played a key role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic so far. The stress and long hours can take a toll on officers. We are grateful to the Government of Alberta and we are pleased to be a partner organization with HiMARC and support this important work.”
Dale McFee, chief of police, Edmonton Police Service

The Alberta government is providing $362,000 to HiMARC for this important work through the COVID-19 Mental Health and Addiction Action Plan – the largest of its kind in Canada.

“Military members, veterans and other first responders are at higher risk of developing PTSD through their work. HiMARC’s programs will help these heroes in our communities find effective treatment for this serious illness.”
Brad Rutherford, MLA for Leduc-Beaumont, and Military Liaison


“HiMARC aims to enhance resilience, address trauma and mental health challenges when they arise, and facilitate successful return to work and life transitions. With support from and collaboration with the Government of Alberta and our partners, we will continue to expand our research and services to enable those who serve and have served, their families, organizations and communities to thrive.”
Suzette Brémault-Phillips, director, HiMARC and associate professor, Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta


""The Heroes in Mind, Advocacy and Research Consortium is an important example of how the University of Alberta's research and education engages multiple sectors and disciplines to benefit the broader community. We are pleased to be working with the Government of Alberta on these two projects to provide continued support to our military, veterans, first responders, and their families."" 
David H. Turpin, president and vice-chancellor, University of Alberta


“AHS Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is grateful to see this funding provided to HiMARC for ongoing research and treatment of mental health issues in military, veterans, first responders and their families. Paramedics on the frontlines will benefit from the increased resiliency and treatment as they deal with difficult situations every day. HiMARC has been a strong partner in mental health and we look forward to working with them in the future. EMS thanks Premier Jason Kenney, Associate Minister Jason Luan and MLA Brad Rutherford for their work in funding this initiative to make it a reality.”
Dale Weiss, executive director, EMS Operations, Alberta Health Services

Quick facts

HiMARC was established through the Chair of Canadian Military and Veterans Clinical Rehabilitation in Canada at the University of Alberta’s Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine to develop and implement innovative solutions to improve operational readiness, resilience and growth, as well as health and well-being of organizations, military members, veterans, public safety personnel, and their families.
HiMARC’s 3MDR project uses an immersive virtual reality system, including exposure therapy, psychotherapy, virtual reality imagery and treadmill walking, to treat PTSD, moral injury and other mental health conditions.
The new online platform will include resources and resilience-building activities, as well as a trial of virtual group activities.

At about 4 a.m. on June 23, EPS received a call reporting an individual behaving erratically at a gas station. EPS officers responded, and the 48-year-old man was arrested for public intoxication and transported to EPS Southwest Division station to be held in custody until sober. At about 7 a.m., police found the man unresponsive inside his cell. EMS attended and pronounced the man deceased. The date of birth the man provided at the time of arrest was incorrect; it has now been determined that the man was 48 years old.
With ASIRT’s investigation underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

The previous government updated the act in 2018 – but failed to address many critical gaps. The proposed changes will address those gaps, such as creating a level playing field for challengers and incumbents and more democratic elections for voters and citizens.
The proposed changes were informed by an extensive consultation process with voters, community advocacy groups, elected officials, school board associations, municipalities and municipal associations.

“The next round of local elections will be critical for the future of Alberta. These changes are about levelling the playing field, so the best candidates for local office – regardless of where they stand on the political spectrum – are running and winning.”
Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs


“AUMA and its members support many of these practical changes to the Local Authorities Election Act that enable fair, transparent elections. It is paramount that local elections remain local, and that amendments preserve the non-partisan, democratic processes that Albertans expect.”
Barry Morishita, president, Alberta Urban Municipalities Association


“It is crucial that municipal elections focus on local issues and provide a level playing field for all candidates. The Local Authorities Election Act continues to be an important tool in supporting local democracy and strong municipal governance. RMA looks forward to working with members to implement changes to the act in advance of the upcoming 2021 municipal election.”
Al Kemmere, president, Rural Municipalities of Alberta


“This legislation was updated in 2018, but those changes didn’t do a lot to help newcomers. As a previously unknown challenger who successfully defeated an incumbent by working extremely hard, I know first-hand how hard it is to break into local politics. These changes create hope and opportunity for all those seeking to represent their communities.”
Jon Dziadyk, Ward 3 councillor, City of Edmonton


“Local leadership matters. These common-sense improvements will help level the playing field and remove barriers to entry. We need a diverse field of candidates to step forward to offer their leadership through our many present challenges. By reducing advantages for incumbents, and increasing financial oversight over large campaigns, Albertans will have more tools and better opportunity to hold their elected officials accountable. Alberta is set to have races that celebrate our full diversity and allow for the most competitive local elections in the country.”
Jeromy Farkas, Ward 11 councillor, City of Calgary

Some of the proposed amendments to municipal and school board elections include:

Ensuring campaign surpluses over $1,000 are donated to charity, instead of requiring municipalities and school boards to open trust accounts to hold them – levelling the playing field for new candidates who may not have previously raised funds.
Allowing Albertans to support and donate to as many candidates as they choose, up to $5,000 per candidate – ensuring those without public name recognition have more flexibility to raise funds and get their message out.
Protecting freedom of speech for third-party advertisers, like unions and corporations, by removing the definition of “political advertising” from the act – creating more open debates on issues and policies.
Allowing candidates to self-finance up to $10,000 a year for their campaigns.
Increasing the limit that potential candidates can raise outside of the campaign period from $2,000 to $5,000 annually – allowing candidates, particularly newcomers, to take steps to increase public awareness earlier.
Making it so candidates do not have to file any disclosures before election day, meaning they can spend their time on their main priority – running for office.
	
To increase transparency, candidates who receive contributions of $50,000 or who spend more than $50,000 will be required to have a chartered professional accountant review their financial statements before submitting them to the municipality or school board.



Quick facts

A surplus of less than $1,000 may be kept by the candidate and used at their discretion. 
The electoral changes will be made as soon as possible to give municipalities and school boards time to prepare materials, candidate packages, municipal bylaws and procedures for the 2021 elections.
If passed, Bill 29 will take effect on Sept. 1.

Proposed changes to the Vital Statistics Act would require anyone 18 years of age or older to submit to a criminal background check as part of their application to change their name.
Those convicted of designated sexual offences under the Criminal Code will be ineligible to complete a legal change of name in Alberta. Designated offences include sexual exploitation, incest, aggravated sexual assault, child pornography, and others.  

“Sexual crimes, especially against children, are truly heinous. Prohibiting these offenders from legally changing their names is yet another step we are taking to ensure the safety of Alberta families in our communities.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Today, I’m issuing a call to action to my counterparts across the country to join us in closing this loophole. Survivors of sexual violence live with the effects of that trauma for the rest of their lives. We are making sure their offenders have to live under their own names.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta

Alberta already has some of the strongest legislation around name changes and these proposed changes will make it even stronger. Under existing rules, anyone applying for a legal change of name in Alberta must be fingerprinted and submit an RCMP fingerprint confirmation letter with their application. Despite this safeguard, convicted sex offenders have still been allowed to legally change their names, provided their applications met all legislated requirements.

“This legislation takes an important step forward for survivors by better recognizing the lifelong impacts they face and making their offenders face the consequences of their actions daily.”
Sheldon Kennedy, survivor, advocate, and co-founder of Respect Group Inc.


“This legislation helps to keep our communities safe by preventing recidivism and ensuring that offenders continue to be held accountable for the harms they have committed.”
Deb Tomlinson, chief executive officer, Association of Alberta Sexual Assault Services


“Any time a child walks through our doors, it means that they’ve been deeply hurt and that is unacceptable. We’re pleased to see the government taking steps to protect children and youth in our communities through this legislation.”
Cheryl Diebel, chief executive officer, Zebra Child Protection Centre

Quick facts

Each year, about 4,000 Alberta residents complete a legal change of name.
Under the existing rules, several requirements must be met:
	
The applicant must be an Alberta resident.
The proposed name must meet requirements set out in the Vital Statistics Act.
Applicants 12 years and older must submit electronic fingerprint confirmation letters with their applications (fingerprints are sent directly to RCMP in Ottawa).
The applicant must provide acceptable government-issued identification, plus proof of current legal name and their proposed new name.


Under the Vital Statistics (Protecting Albertans from Convicted Sex Offenders) Amendment Act, anyone 18 years of age or older applying for a legal change of name in Alberta would also have to submit either a criminal record check or a police information check.
Those convicted of designated offences listed in subsection 490.011(1) (a), (c), (c.1), (d), (d.1) and (e) of the Criminal Code of Canada would be banned for life from completing a legal change of name in Alberta.
The Alberta government stopped publishing legal changes of name in the Alberta Gazette in 2016 out of concern for the safety of vulnerable Albertans like transgender persons and victims of domestic abuse.

“The first record of French settlers celebrating June 24, Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, dates back to the early 17th century. The annual celebration in Canada, recognizing the patron saint of French Canadians, became tradition in the 1800s.
“Today, French-speaking Albertans across the province celebrate Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day with lively music, dance and meals befitting of the cultures that make up la Francophonie. While these celebrations are affected by COVID-19, we can still reflect on the day and keep the thoughts and spirit of these celebrations in our hearts and minds as we look forward to celebrating together in years to come.
“To all French-speaking Albertans, joyeuse Saint-Jean-Baptiste!”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women


“Today, on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, it’s a wonderful opportunity to highlight the vitality of the Canadian Francophonie and the dynamism of the French language and cultures in Alberta. From Plamondon to Grande Prairie, from Fort McMurray to Lethbridge, communities across Alberta celebrate this important day and their joie de vivre.
“French was the first European language spoken in Alberta and it remains the most widely spoken language after English. Although historically, much of Alberta's francophone population could trace its origins to Quebec and France, today francophones in Alberta come from across the country and around the world. This year’s celebrations have gone digital in many cases, which has allowed francophones from across the province to connect with one another and celebrate through our shared language.
“I want to wish everyone a happy Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day!”
 Laila Goodridge, parliamentary secretary for the Francophonie


Mesdames Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine, et Laila Goodridge, secrétaire parlementaire à la francophonie, ont émis la déclaration suivante à l'occasion de la Saint-Jean-Baptiste :

« Les colons français auraient célébré la Saint-Jean-Baptiste pour la première fois un 24 juin du début du 17e siècle. Au Canada, cette célébration annuelle en reconnaissance du saint patron des Canadiens français est devenue une tradition dans les années 1800.
« Aujourd'hui, les Albertains et les Albertaines francophones de toute la province célèbrent la Saint-Jean-Baptiste en musique, en danse et en repas animés, adaptés aux cultures qui forment la francophonie de la province. Bien que les célébrations de cette année soient affectées par la COVID-19, rien ne nous empêche de nous pencher sur le sens de l’événement et faire vivre les pensées et l'esprit de ces célébrations dans nos cœurs et nos esprits tout en nous réjouissant à l’idée de célébrer ensemble dans les années à venir.
« Je souhaite une bonne Saint-Jean-Baptiste à tous les Albertains et toutes les Albertaines francophones! »

Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine



« Aujourd'hui, la fête de la Saint-Jean-Baptiste nous offre une belle occasion de souligner la vitalité de la francophonie canadienne et le dynamisme de la langue et des cultures françaises en Alberta. De Plamondon à Grande Prairie, de Fort McMurray à Lethbridge, des communautés célèbrent cette journée importante et leur joie de vivre partout en Alberta.
« Le français a été la première langue européenne parlée en Alberta, et elle demeure la langue parlée le plus couramment dans notre province après l'anglais. Bien qu'historiquement, une grande partie de la population francophone de l'Alberta ait pu trouver ses origines au Québec et en France, les francophones de l'Alberta viennent aujourd'hui de partout au pays et du monde entier. Cette année, bon nombre des célébrations sont passées au numérique, ce qui a permis aux francophones de toute la province de se connecter les uns aux autres pour célébrer dans leur langue.
« Je souhaite à tous et à toutes une bonne Saint-Jean-Baptiste! »
Laila Goodridge, secrétaire parlementaire à la francophonie

More businesses, sport and recreation services are open. Some larger gatherings are permitted.
Public health guidance must be followed.
Stage three depends on success in stage two, determined by: active case numbers, infection rates, health-care system capacity based on numbers in hospital and intensive care.
For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.
The relaunch status map shows the level of risk in regions and information about local health measures. It also shows the rate of COVID-19 cases and the number of active cases.

Serology testing to track the spread

Alberta is investing $10 million in voluntary serology testing for targeted groups for past exposure.
This will help measure the virus spread among people who never felt sick, or didn’t report it.

Access to justice

The Court of Queen’s Bench is scheduling more previously postponed matters. For details, visit https://albertacourts.ca/qb/resources/announcements.

Supporting Alberta businesses through relaunch

The Alberta Biz Connect web page has health and safety guidelines for general workplaces and specific industry sectors. Businesses are encouraged to check for new and updated guidance documents.


A template on the website can help businesses plan how to protect employees and patrons from infection. Completing the template is voluntary.

Albertans downloading tracer app

The ABTraceTogether app enhances manual contact tracing and capacity, and facilitates early detection. It means Albertans will be contacted more quickly if they are at risk.
Use of the app is voluntary; users must opt in. The app currently has 214,650 registered users.
Privacy is protected. The app does not track user’s physical location or use GPS. All contact data is only on the user’s phone and is deleted after 21 days.  
Secure contact tracing is a cornerstone of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy.

ALBERTA UTILITIES COMMISSION ACT (section 3) - Effective June 24, 2020, designates Carolyn Dahl Rees as the Chair of the Alberta Utilities Commission for a term to expire on June 23, 2021, and rescinds the appointment of a member of the Alberta Utilities Commission.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Serology testing is used to detect the presence of antibodies in a person’s blood, indicating that a person has been exposed to the COVID-19 virus in the past. This is different from the robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing already available to all Albertans, which is the most effective way to test if anyone currently has the virus.
Alberta Health is investing in four voluntary public health studies, which will serologically test specific groups of Albertans for the virus. Alberta Health Services (AHS) will also make serology testing available for specific clinical purposes where testing can inform treatment decisions.
Alberta is the first province in Canada to make this targeted serology testing available.

“We committed to investing in expanding COVID-19 testing as part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy. Investing in these focused studies of select groups will help us get a better sense of the situation in Alberta and learn more about the virus. The more we know about how COVID-19 is spreading, the better we can protect Albertans.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“We anticipate that there are people in the province who have been infected with COVID-19 and either were not tested, or were unaware that they had the virus. Investing in these representative public health studies will help us understand what percentage of Albertans have a history of infection, and how to improve our health response.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health


“Albertans’ collective efforts to follow public health guidelines have helped to significantly slow the spread of COVID-19 in our province. In addition to our robust testing efforts to detect positive cases, antibody testing is one more tool that will provide the critical data we need to monitor and track the virus within our communities.”
Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO, Alberta Health Services

The $10-million investment will fund two pediatric studies that will measure COVID-19 antibody prevalence among groups of Calgary and Edmonton children until 2022. A third study will test samples from blood collected for other purposes across the province, and a fourth will regularly test select Albertans over the age of 45 to help officials better estimate the number of people exposed to COVID-19.
By investing in serology studies, Alberta will be able to better estimate the number of people who have previously contracted COVID-19 and learn about how the virus is spreading over time.
As well, Alberta Precision Laboratories will offer serology testing for specific clinical purposes and funded population-level serology research studies.

L'Alberta investit 10 millions de dollars dans des tests sérologiques ciblés qui permettront de suivre la propagation de la COVID-19 dans la province.
Les tests sérologiques servent à détecter la présence d'anticorps dans le sang et peuvent ainsi indiquer qu'une personne a déjà été exposée au virus de la COVID-19. Ces tests diffèrent du robuste test d'amplification en chaîne par polymérase (PCR), déjà offert à toute la population albertaine et qui constitue le moyen le plus efficace de vérifier si une personne est actuellement porteuse du virus.
Le ministère de la Santé investit des fonds dans quatre études volontaires de santé publique, qui permettront de tester la sérologie de groupes spécifiques d'Albertains et d’Albertaines pour le virus. L’Alberta Health Services (services de santé de l'Alberta (AHS)) mettra également à disposition des tests sérologiques à des fins cliniques spécifiques dans le but d’éclairer les décisions de traitement.
L'Alberta est la première province du Canada à offrir ce test sérologique ciblé.

« Nous nous sommes engagés à investir dans le développement d’autres tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 dans le cadre de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta. En investissant dans ces études ciblées sur des groupes sélectionnés, nous serons en mesure de mieux comprendre la situation en Alberta et d’en apprendre davantage sur le virus. Plus nous en saurons sur la manière dont la COVID-19 se propage, mieux nous pourrons protéger les Albertains et les Albertaines. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé


« Nous pensons qu'il y a des personnes dans la province qui ont été infectées par la COVID-19 sans le savoir ou sans avoir été testées. En investissant dans ces études représentatives de santé publique, nous aurons une meilleure idée du pourcentage d’Albertains et d’Aa population aoir été testées. lbertaines qui ont été infectées et de la façon dont nous pouvons améliorer nos interventions en matière de santé. »
Dre Deena Hinshaw, médecin hygiéniste en chef


« Les efforts collectifs déployés par la population albertaine pour suivre les directives de santé publique ont contribué à ralentir considérablement la propagation de la COVID-19 dans notre province. En plus de nos solides efforts de dépistage, le test de dépistage des anticorps est un outil supplémentaire qui fournira les données essentielles dont nous avons besoin pour surveiller et suivre la propagation du virus au sein de nos communautés. »
Dre Verna Yiu, présidente et directrice générale, Alberta Health Services

L'investissement de 10 millions de dollars financera deux études pédiatriques qui mesureront la prévalence des anticorps de la COVID-19 chez des groupes d'enfants de Calgary et d'Edmonton jusqu'en 2022. Une troisième étude analysera des échantillons de sang prélevés à d'autres fins dans toute la province, et dans le cadre d’une quatrième étude, les responsables testeront régulièrement des Albertains et Albertaines de plus de 45 ans afin de pouvoir mieux estimer le nombre de personnes exposées à la COVID-19.
En investissant dans des études sérologiques, l'Alberta sera mieux en mesure d’estimer le nombre de personnes qui ont déjà contracté la COVID-19 en plus d'apprendre comment le virus se propage au fil du temps.
En outre, les laboratoires Alberta Precision Laboratories proposeront des tests sérologiques à des fins cliniques spécifiques et financeront des études de recherche sérologique au sein de la population.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Aligning with the government’s commitment to review Alberta’s electricity agencies, Carolyn Dahl Rees, a current AUC commissioner, will serve as interim chair of the AUC for up to 12 months. She has extensive legal and regulatory experience within the electricity sector, including a previous term as acting chair and vice-chair of the AUC from 2008 to 2012. As interim chair, Dahl Rees will strengthen the Commission’s focus on streamlining regulatory processes and reducing red tape in order to provide more certainty to investors, the electricity market, and ultimately, consumers. The appointment takes effect June 24.

“The AUC has existed in its current form for 12 years, and it’s important we allow it to adapt, as necessary, to best serve Albertans. Ms. Dahl Rees is well qualified to provide leadership as the Commission modernizes its operations while continuing to focus on its core operations. I thank Mark Kolesar, the outgoing chair, for his service.”
Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity

Government expects the AUC to strengthen its work through streamlining processes, reducing red tape, and increasing investor confidence in Alberta’s electricity sector. Government also looks forward to reviewing the findings of an AUC-established independent committee focused on improving the timeliness of its regulatory proceedings – including how processes and procedures can be eliminated or made more efficient.
Quick facts

The AUC regulates Alberta’s utilities and natural gas and electricity markets to protect the social, economic and environmental interests of ratepayers where competitive market forces cannot. The AUC is responsible for ensuring that the delivery of Alberta's utility service is fair, responsible, and in the public interest.
The AUC was created in 2008, following the passing of the Alberta Utilities Commission Act.
Alberta has four electricity agencies:

Referendums enhance democracy by consulting Albertans on issues of importance. As the Fair Deal Panel recommended, Albertans want a real and direct say on laws and issues that affect them to best meet their current and future needs.

“Albertans continue to tell us that they want a greater say in the politics in this province – and that is what we’re doing. This legislation will help us strengthen democracy and increase accountability, giving Albertans a louder voice and a direct impact on the actions of government.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“The Fair Deal Panel was clear – Albertans want a more direct say on important matters. Expanding what referendums can be held on would give Albertans the opportunity to have their say on matters that affect both their daily lives and the future of our province.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General

Referendums could be held on a number of government-led initiatives or matters of public interest before they are implemented, including the recommendations of the Fair Deal Panel. Referendums could be held alongside a provincial or municipal election, or be held separately or by mail-in ballot.
Government also introduced Bill 27, the Alberta Senate Election Amendment Act. If passed, this bill would make minor wording and housekeeping changes, as well as give the Minister of Municipal Affairs the same directive-making powers they have in municipal elections when a Senate election is held in conjunction with a municipal election.

“The temporary reporting relief provided through Environment and Parks allowed industry time to ensure the health and safety of staff and the communities in which they work. Now that the public health emergency is no longer in effect and Alberta is reopening as part of our phase two relaunch, industry can resume business while keeping communities and employees safe.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

Alberta Environment and Parks also authorized a three-month extension to industry to submit regulatory reports for emissions reduction achievements and renewable fuel operator compliance. These reports are due June 30. All documentation related to Water Act approvals and licences, reports for public land rentals, and reports related to Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act authorizations that were collected since the ministerial order was put in place must now be submitted. Drinking water facilities were not affected by the order and were still required to submit reports during the pandemic.
Ministerial orders put in place by the Ministry of Energy are also being rescinded on July 15, earlier than anticipated.

“There is no higher priority than the safety of workers and the communities they work in. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic required us to operate under an abundance of caution during the height of the health emergency. While this pause was of low risk, it is also important that we maintain full confidence in the rigour of our regulatory system and return to all regular reporting activities as soon as it is safe to do so. While we expect precautionary measures to be taken, we have no doubt that industry is more than capable of adapting to these challenges.”

Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy

“Today, on the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism, we pay tribute to those who were murdered or maimed in terror attacks and their loved ones whose lives were destroyed by this senseless evil. This is also a day on which we reiterate our commitment to vigilance against these assaults on our values.
“Canadians are not immune to these acts of hatred. June 23 was chosen to commemorate the 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182, which took the lives of 329 innocents, including 280 Canadians. While this horrific act of evil remains the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history, extremists have continued to inflict violence upon Canadians at home and abroad, from Ottawa and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, to New York City and Tel Aviv.  
“While we mourn the victims of senseless violence and grieve along with their loved ones, we also honour our law enforcement and military personnel who defend our values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.
“The calculated, far-reaching violence inflicted on free peoples and the threat of it to achieve political ends is pure evil and we cannot ignore it, we cannot tolerate it, we cannot excuse it, and we cannot allow it to continue. While the scars and wounds are borne by victims and their families, they are also an assault on Albertans’ core ideals and undermine the democratic principles we uphold.”

“Today’s announcement that Nisku-based contractor Michels Canada will construct the Alberta portion of the Keystone XL pipeline confirms thousands of new jobs will begin to fuel the provincial economy within weeks.
“After several months of bleak economic news, it’s invigorating to see Alberta’s investment in Keystone XL begin to pay off with confirmation of the imminent hiring of 1,000 construction workers each year over the next two years.
“This will spur thousands more jobs and economic activity in associated trades, retail and hospitality services in communities along the route when construction begins this summer. It’s another significant step in fulfilling our commitment to Albertans to protect the value of the province’s energy resources and attract new investment.
“Overall, Keystone XL will support 17,000 Canadian workers, contribute $2.4 billion to Canada’s GDP and will generate an estimated $30 billion in revenues for future generations of Albertans and Canadians.
“Once operational, the TC Energy project will provide North America with a stable, secure supply of crude oil, reducing reliance on supply from OPEC. The pipeline will carry 830,000 barrels per day of oil to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, where Western Canadian crude is in high demand.
“We have been working closely with our U.S. partners at the state and federal level to strengthen North American energy security and independence. The overwhelming consensus is projects such as Keystone XL will play a vital role in the post-pandemic economic recovery of both our countries.
“Construction of the Alberta portion of the pipeline will begin this summer near Oyen and finish near Hardisty in the spring of 2022.”

An additional six million masks have been or will be shared directly with municipalities, seniors organizations, Indigenous partners, places of worship and others to help limit the spread of COVID-19.
Thanks to the success of the program, we have paused the distribution of free non-medical masks at the three restaurant partners until the second phase in July. Albertans who have not received a mask can continue to call 211 to request a package.
Alberta is the only province in Canada to make free non-medical masks available to help limit the spread of COVID-19.
Another 20 million masks will be distributed in July, via drive-thrus and other partners. Details will be announced in the next couple of weeks.

“Thank you to all our partners for helping our government distribute millions of non-medical masks to every corner of Alberta. No other province in Canada has accomplished such a feat. A program of this scale would not have been possible without your hard work and community support. We will continue to support Albertans as we move through stage two of relaunch, and people continue to get back to work.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

This initiative is a key part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely reopen our economy while protecting Albertans from COVID-19.
In addition to the masks shared via drive-thru windows, the Alberta government provided masks directly to:

Edmonton Transit, Calgary Transit, and municipalities without convenient access to a drive-thru
First Nations and Metis Settlements
Seniors organizations and independent living facilities
Long-term care and permanent supportive living facilities
Women’s shelters, homeless shelters and street outreach programs
Addiction treatment centres
Foster and kinship parents
Albertans who contacted 211 and couldn’t access a drive-thru partner or the alternate municipal or community providers

The distribution of masks to municipalities without easy access to a drive-thru, First Nations, Metis Settlements and other local agencies will continue following the timelines set by those groups.
As of June 19, government has received 1,000 requests for masks from places of worship across the province, and more than two million masks will be provided to them in the next few days for distribution to their congregations.
Quick facts about the mask distribution

More than 20 million non-medical masks have or will soon be shared with Albertans.
14 million masks were shared through nearly 600 A&W, McDonald’s Canada, or Tim Hortons drive-thrus.
About 95 per cent of Albertans live within 10 kilometres of the drive-thrus through which the masks were distributed.
Mask use is not mandatory; they are an option for situations where maintaining a distance of two metres is not possible.
Alberta 211 is a community service partner supporting the distribution of masks. Any concerns about the distribution of masks should be directed to the feedback form on alberta.ca/masks.
Instructions for proper care and use of non-medical masks are available at alberta.ca/masks.

La première phase de la distribution gratuite de masques non médicaux en Alberta est terminée, avec plus de 14 millions de masques distribués aux services à l’auto des restaurants A&W, McDonald's Canada et Tim Hortons de la province.
Six millions de masques supplémentaires ont été ou seront envoyés directement avec les municipalités, les organismes de personnes âgées, les Autochtones et les lieux de culte, entre autres, afin d’aider à limiter la propagation de la COVID-19.
À la suite du succès du programme, nous avons interrompu la distribution de masques non médicaux gratuits dans les trois chaînes de restaurants partenaires jusqu'à la deuxième phase en juillet. Les Albertains et les Albertaines qui n'ont pas reçu de masques peuvent continuer de composer le 211 pour en commander un paquet.
L'Alberta est la seule province canadienne à offrir des masques non médicaux gratuits pour aider à freiner la propagation de la COVID-19.
Vingt millions de masques supplémentaires seront distribués en juillet aux services à l’auto et par l'intermédiaire d'autres partenaires. Les détails concernant la distribution seront annoncés dans les deux prochaines semaines.

« Nous remercions tous nos partenaires d'avoir aidé notre gouvernement à distribuer des millions de masques non médicaux dans tous les coins de l'Alberta. Aucune autre province du Canada n'a accompli un tel exploit. Un programme de cette envergure n'aurait pas été possible sans leur travail acharné et le soutien de la communauté. Nous continuerons à soutenir la population albertaine pendant la deuxième étape de la relance et à mesure que les gens retourneront au travail. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé

Cette initiative est un élément clé de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta, qui vise à redresser l’économie en toute sécurité tout en protégeant les Albertains et Albertaines contre la COVID-19.
En plus des masques distribués par l'intermédiaire des guichets de service à l’auto, le gouvernement de l'Alberta a fourni directement des masques aux communautés et organismes suivants :

les sociétés de transport d’Edmonton et de Calgary, et les municipalités qui n'ont pas d'accès pratique à un service à l’auto
les premières nations et établissements métis
les organismes de personnes âgées et centres de vie autonome
les centres de soins de longue durée et les centres de soutien permanent
les refuges pour femmes, les refuges pour sans-abri et les programmes de sensibilisation communautaires dans la rue
les centres de traitement des toxicomanies
les parents et les familles d'accueil
les Albertains et les Albertaines qui ont contacté le 211 parce qu’ils n'ont pas pu accéder à un partenaire de service au volant ou aux autres fournisseurs municipaux ou communautaires

La distribution de masques aux municipalités qui n'ont pas facilement accès à un service à l’auto, aux Premières nations, aux établissements métis et à d'autres organismes locaux se poursuivra selon les échéances fixées par ces groupes.
Au 19 juin, le gouvernement avait reçu 1 000 demandes de masques de lieux de culte situés dans toute la province, et plus de deux millions de masques seront fournis à ces endroits au cours des prochains jours pour être distribués au sein des congrégations.
Quelques faits sur la distribution des masques

Plus de 20 millions de masques non médicaux ont été ou seront bientôt distribués au sein de la population albertaine.
Quatorze millions de masques ont été distribués dans près de 600 restaurants A&W, McDonald's Canada et Tim Hortons.
Environ 95 % des Albertains et des Albertaines vivent dans un rayon de 10 kilomètres d’un service à l’auto où les masques ont été distribués.
L'utilisation des masques n'est pas obligatoire; il s’agit d’une option dans les situations où il n'est pas possible de maintenir une distance de deux mètres avec les autres.
La ligne Alberta 211 est un partenaire de service communautaire qui soutient la distribution des masques. Toute préoccupation concernant la distribution des masques doit être communiquée au moyen du formulaire de commentaires accessible dans le site alberta.ca/masks.
Des instructions pour le soin et l'utilisation appropriés des masques non médicaux sont offertes à alberta.ca/masks.

An additional $4 million over four years will help expand access to the Virtual Opioid Dependency Program (VODP). The Alberta Health Services program uses telehealth technology to allow Albertans to access treatment for opioid use disorder. In addition to medical support, the VODP provides clients with addiction counselling and other supports including transitional services.
The Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT) Gap Coverage program will cover the costs of medications to treat opioid use disorder for Albertans who are waiting to receive coverage through a supplementary health benefit plan. The program will cover costs for up to 120 days, during which an Albertan can apply for and receive supplementary health benefits.

“We’re creating pathways for recovery across the continuum of care for Albertans. The Virtual Opioid Dependency and OAT Gap Coverage programs are important tools to help people across the province get the treatment they need to recover and live healthy, successful lives.”
Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions

The VODP has already proven effective at helping Albertans dealing with addiction. About 40 per cent of VODP clients over the past year reported an opioid overdose upon entering the program. After a year in the program, fewer than 10 per cent of clients reported an overdose.
Albertans can be referred to the VODP by any community health-care provider or even refer themselves to the program. Once enrolled, patients have regular video conferencing visits with a doctor and other health professionals. Video conferencing visits can be arranged in any community in Alberta.

“Our clients come from many backgrounds and have, by and large, experienced a lot of hardship.  Despite this, clients and their families tell us that they are moving forward in recovery to lives they never thought they could have. It is critical that we meet people where they are at and remove obstacles to getting better. This program delivers high-quality addiction treatment to people when they need it, no matter where in Alberta they live or work. Our team collaborates with local supports, including those in community pharmacies, enabling people to access care as close to home as possible.“
Dr. Nathaniel Day, medical director, Addiction and Mental Health, VODP

VODP quick facts

The VODP is available province wide and has served more than 2,000 clients to date, including almost 1,300 in the past year.
The program helps ensure smooth transitions for patients who are moving from one care setting to another (e.g., from hospital-based care to community-based care).
The VODP was recently recognized by the Health Quality Council of Alberta for improving patients’ overall experience in accessing and receiving health-care services.
The additional funding will also assist with increasing existing programming and service capacity.
To learn more about the Virtual Opioid Dependency Program or refer yourself for treatment, call 1-844-383-7688.

The OAT Gap Coverage program covers all payments for buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone. These medications are used to treat opioid use disorder. They must be taken every day and can cost more than $10,000 per year for those without supplementary health benefits.
OAT Gap Coverage Program quick facts

The program launched on April 1. Since then, more than 1,100 Albertans have been enrolled.
Albertans must enrol in a supplementary health benefits plan to continue to receive coverage for OAT medications after the 120-day period covered by the program.
The OAT Gap Coverage Program is funded through the Government of Canada’s Emergency Treatment Fund. Program funding this year is estimated to be about $2 million.

ALBERTA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CORPORATION ACT (section 4); ALBERTA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CORPORATION REGULATION (section 2) - Effective July 1, 2020, reappoints Tom Woods as a member of the board of directors of the Alberta Investment Management Corporation for a term to expire on June 30, 2023, and appoints Mark Wiseman as a member and designates him as chair of the board of directors of the Alberta Investment Management Corporation for a term to expire on June 30, 2023.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




On May 17, a concrete drop structure failed on the St. Mary Canal, which is located in northern Montana and owned by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The canal diverts water from the St. Mary River to the Milk River. Permanent repairs to the canal will begin immediately, with completion scheduled for September. Repairs will be paid for by U.S. officials.

“We recognize the severity of the situation and the importance of the Milk River basin to surrounding communities and the local economy. Environment and Parks is supporting Alberta water users and working with our federal and U.S. counterparts to keep water users informed as work to repair the canal progresses.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks


“I want to assure my constituents in Taber-Warner that we are taking the situation along the Milk River very seriously. I will continue to meet with the local mayors, reeves and irrigators over the coming weeks and months as this situation continues to evolve.”
Grant Hunter, MLA for Taber-Warner

Environment and Parks will support Alberta water users in the Milk River basin with an updated water supply outlook, updates on infrastructure repairs south of the border, details on allotments and water use by each country and support for water conservation planning, as necessary.
With no canal in place, water licence holders in Alberta should be prepared for only natural flows on the Milk River throughout the summer and should proactively explore options for water conservation.
Recreational users will also be impacted. Without diverted water via the St. Mary Canal, Milk River water levels will likely be too low this summer for activities like canoeing or kayaking.
No impacts to drinking water or household use are expected. The province provided the Town of Milk River with funding to increase water storage. The town’s current stored water supply would support four months of water use in the event the town was unable to draw any more water from the river.
Quick facts

Water use on both the St. Mary River and the Milk River are governed by the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909.
The accredited officers for the St. Mary and Milk rivers calculate natural flows and water usage by each country semi-monthly during the irrigation season, ensure deficits are balanced by Oct. 31, and resolve disputes, if necessary.
During the irrigation season (April 1 to Oct. 31), Canada is entitled to 25 per cent of the natural flow of the Milk River, up to a natural flow of 18.9 cubic metres per second, and 50 per cent of natural flows above this threshold.
On the St. Mary River, from which the St. Mary Canal diverts water, Canada is entitled to 75 per cent of natural flows up to 18.9 cubic metres per second during the irrigation season and 50 per cent of natural flows above this threshold. Natural flows are shared equally with the United States from Nov. 1 to March 31.
The United States may accumulate a deficit on the St. Mary River from March 1 to May 31, which would be equalized through a Canadian entitlement to water on the Milk River transferred via the St. Mary Canal.
The St. Mary Canal was constructed between 1907 and 1915.

People can visit alberta.ca until Aug. 10 to share their feedback. Responses from the online survey will assist government in developing the Alberta Infrastructure Act, which will outline how government will plan for and prioritize capital spending. Input collected will also help inform development of a 20-Year Strategic Capital Plan, which will guide government’s approach to long-term planning for infrastructure.

“Infrastructure is a critical part of Alberta’s relaunch plan to protect jobs and get our province back to work. What we build today will impact the education, health care, and social services we deliver in the future. We are investing in critical projects today, that will help ensure our province remains the best place to live, work and raise a family, while creating jobs when they are needed most. We want to hear and learn from industry, tradespeople and everyday Albertans on how we can best address the infrastructure needs of the province.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure

The Alberta Infrastructure Act and 20-Year Strategic Capital Plan will help with forward planning of all types of infrastructure, including the SUCH sector (schools, universities, colleges and health), irrigation and rural broadband projects, roads, bridges, and infrastructure critical to support natural resource development.
Quick facts

The Alberta Infrastructure Act is expected to be introduced in the fall 2020 legislative session.
The 20-Year Strategic Capital Plan is expected to be released by early 2021.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Alberta families welcomed 51,598 babies in 2019 – 26,328 boys and 25,270 girls. Noah returned as the most popular boy’s name for the second time in three years, previously topping the list in 2017. For the seventh year in a row, Olivia was the most popular girl’s name.
Other popular names for boys were Liam, Oliver, Ethan and Jack, while Charlotte, Sophia, Emma and Ava rounded out the top five names for girls.

“One of the most memorable moments for me as a new father was when my wife and I chose the name for our son last fall. Choosing a name for your child is fun and exciting. I want to congratulate all new parents in Alberta and reassure them, as well as Albertans expecting a child in the near future, that we are working every day to make sure your children have a great future in a strong Alberta.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta

Of the 13,718 different names recorded in 2019, some Alberta parents seem to have been inspired by popular culture, such as Game of Thrones (Khaleesi, Sansa, Brienne), Lord of the Rings (Arwen, Eowyn, Theoden), and Marvel comics (Loki, Rogue, Xavier-Charles).
Some Alberta parents also selected names referencing Greek (Artemis, Apollo, Persephone, Zeus) and Roman (Juno, Mars, Venus, Neptune) mythology, while others chose names referring to geographic locations (Arizona, Memphis, Salem, Jerusalem).
Quick facts

Notable changes to the 2019 lists:
	
Hannah reappeared on the Top 10 girls’ names list for the first time since 2014.
Logan dropped to 12th place on the boys’ names list after appearing in the top five in 2017 and 2018.
Harper dropped to 16th place on the girls’ names list after placing seventh in 2018.


The highest annual birth count in Alberta remains 56,744, which was recorded in 2015.
Parents have up to one year to register their child’s birth. As a result, the 2019 list of baby names and birth statistics may change slightly.

“Today, Albertans join all Canadians in celebrating National Indigenous Peoples Day. It is a day to honour the unique histories and cultures of First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples.
“Also on this day in 1899, Treaty 8 was signed in northern Alberta – the largest land treaty in our country’s history. Alberta respects the First Nations’ treaty relationship with the Crown, and we are proud of the government-to-government relationship we share.
“Our government is committed to a better and more inclusive Alberta for all, which is why we are working to remove barriers to prosperity for Indigenous Peoples. More than 258,000 First Nations, Métis and Inuit people call Alberta home, and we’re confident their business acumen and vision will be instrumental in restoring our province’s economy.
“By creating programs for community groups to invest in natural resource projects, like the Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation, we are helping to build a clearer path to economic reconciliation.
“We are also walking side by side with communities toward social change, so current and future generations of Indigenous people can live free of culture- and gender-based harm. Celebrating a bright future depends on us all taking action today.
“I encourage all Albertans to take the time to learn more about how Indigenous cultures and contributions have enriched the province we know today. The month of June provides many special opportunities to celebrate Indigenous people in Alberta. Let’s continue to reach out to them all through the year, with appreciation and understanding.
“Happy National Indigenous Peoples Day!”

“Whether the man you honour is a father by blood or by the heart, Father’s Day is an opportune time to express love and gratitude for his role in your life.
“This year has been especially difficult. Public health restrictions leave many Albertans unable to visit their fathers. Protecting them from infection also is an act of love. While the pandemic has changed much, what hasn’t changed is our love and gratitude for all our fathers do and mean to us.
“I encourage everyone to find a way to pay tribute to the man we call Dad. Happy Father’s Day!”

The additional grant funding will support about 1,800 jobs in communities across Alberta.

“Albertans in every corner of the province are facing real challenges as our economy recovers from COVID-19 and our municipalities rely on strong local infrastructure to attract investment and grow their economies. As we move ahead with Alberta’s relaunch, this additional investment will go a long way to helping rural municipalities get back on their feet and back to work.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“We are taking the next step in Alberta’s economic recovery by significantly increasing funding for well-used infrastructure and water grant programs for our municipalities. This stimulus funding is just one part of our government’s economic recovery plan to get Albertans back to work. It makes sense to flow stimulus funding into our municipalities through existing programs that communities are familiar with, that build and rebuild roads, bridges, and water infrastructure that communities need constructed and fixed.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation


“Increased funding through key infrastructure grant programs is welcomed to support the construction and maintenance of needed municipal road and bridge infrastructure that Alberta’s industries rely on for access to natural resources and markets. Rural municipalities look forward to utilizing increased STIP funding for municipal infrastructure projects that will contribute to local economic growth and Alberta’s overall economic recovery.”
Al Kemmere, president, Rural Municipalities of Alberta

Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program (STIP)
About $50 million in additional STIP funding will go to municipalities across Alberta to support 69 projects and about 480 jobs. The program funds bridge improvements, upgrades to resource roads and community airports and other municipal initiatives.
Water Infrastructure Grants
About $150 million will support 55 water and wastewater improvement projects and approximately 1,300 jobs.

$137 million allocated to the Alberta Municipal/Wastewater Partnership for 54 projects


$13 million to the First Nations Water Tie-in Program to support a water tie-in program for the Ermineskin Cree Nation to the Ponoka regional water pipeline.

Quick facts

These awards were presented to individuals and teams who demonstrated outstanding leadership qualities and delivered extraordinary work within the public service.
Six Government of Alberta employees received individual leadership awards, one of the highest honours a member of the Alberta Public Service can receive. Included in this group is Dr. Deena Hinshaw, who was recognized for her leadership during the pandemic.

“Albertans are so fortunate to have such dedicated public servants. They have distinguished themselves with calm and caring leadership, compassionate service, and by being strong role models. This is especially true of those public servants who helped Alberta respond to the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic. But, as much as those serving during this challenging time rose to the call of duty, so too do the public servants across Alberta every day. This passionate, dedicated service makes Alberta the best place to live, work and raise a family. I’m grateful every day for the dedication and service of those who answer the call of public service. 
Jason Kenney, Premier

Six teams were also presented with Premier’s Public Service Awards for exceptional work in service delivery and public policy innovation.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




If passed, Bill 25, Protecting Alberta Industry from Theft Act, 2020, and associated regulations will require scrap metal dealers to report all transactions involving commonly stolen metals and items such as catalytic converters to law enforcement.
Metal theft is a significant risk to individuals, their families, their communities, and the public at large. Thieves terrify property and business owners by trespassing and stealing materials such as copper wire and industrial batteries, and frequently damage and interfere with critical systems like electrical lines, telecommunications networks and transportation infrastructure.
Criminals often steal metal from property owners and businesses in isolated areas to avoid detection, making rural Albertans a particular target of thieves and trespassers looking for metal to steal and sell.
The government took decisive steps against metal theft in fall 2019 by proclaiming the Scrap Metal Dealers and Recyclers Identification Act, which passed in 2013 but previous governments never brought into force.

“Our government has heard loud and clear from Albertans who have been victimized by property theft for far too long. We are taking action to protect them by making it more difficult for criminals to monetize the goods and materials they steal. This will send a strong message that taking advantage of vulnerable Albertans and their businesses will not be tolerated. We want Albertans to know we are going to do everything we can as a provincial government to help them feel safe.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


“Scrap metal theft is an ongoing challenge across rural Alberta with major impacts on many rural business and industries. Bill 25 is an important step toward protecting rural Albertans from the risks of scrap metal theft by developing a centralized database of scrap metal sales. RMA appreciates the Government of Alberta’s decisive action to address rural crime and support safe rural communities.”
Al Kemmere, president, Rural Municipalities of Alberta

Amendments to the act and new regulations define the types of metal subject to reporting rules, specify identification requirements for sellers and record-keeping duties for dealers, as well as raising the penalties for anyone who contravenes the act. 

“We welcome these regulations and thank the government for taking strong measures to address the issue of metal theft in our province. The theft of copper wire and other metals from critical infrastructure, including the electricity sector, can be a fatal mistake for thieves and risks the safety of our employees and communities across Alberta.”
Scott Yost, senior manager, security and contingency planning, Capital Power

To give stakeholders time to adjust and comply, the new provisions would be implemented in two stages.
On Sept. 1, new provisions would include a requirement for sellers to provide government-issued photo ID. Dealers would be required to record and retain the seller’s ID information, as well as details of the transaction.
Provisions coming into force on Nov. 1 would include requirements for dealers to report transactions to law enforcement and for all payments to be made using traceable forms of currency, such as electronic transfers or cheques.
Quick facts

Proposed increased fines for contraventions of the act:
	
For individuals:
		
First offence: $10,000 or one year in jail, or both (up from $5,000)
Second or subsequent offence: $25,000 or one year in jail, or both (up from $15,000)


For corporations:
		
First offence: $50,000 (up from $15,000)
Second or subsequent offence: $200,000 (up from $50,000)

The bill proposes amendments to 15 acts across seven ministries. The amendments are being proposed now that the state of public health emergency has ended.
The proposed amendments will allow some pandemic response efforts to continue and introduce new measures to support the safe and successful reopening of Alberta’s economy.

“Bill 24 allows us to continue to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic to protect public health and ensure Albertans have access to the services and support they need as Alberta moves forward with reopening our economy.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Highlights of the bill include extending existing measures, such as:

Extending to August 2021 the unpaid job-protected leave specific to COVID-19, which allows employees to take leave to care for a child due to school or daycare closures or to care for an ill or self-isolating family member.
Providing updated guidance for operating child care programs, including increasing the maximum cohort group size from 10 to 30 staff and children, helping operators reopen safely and ensuring parents have access to child care as they return to work.
Allowing for remote signing and witnessing of estate and care documents through two-way video conferencing, ensuring Albertans continue to have access to justice during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Extending the maximum time for temporary layoffs related to COVID-19 from 120 days to 180 days (this change would come into force upon first reading).
Extending arrangements that support the Chief Medical Officer of Health Order No. 10 that allows a health-care facility to limit employees to working at one site.
Extending the use of emergency powers for an additional 60 days now that the state of public health emergency has ended, and extending existing ministerial orders to continue to protect the health of Albertans during relaunch.
Creating a new regulation-making authority to support and empower orders of the chief medical officer of health, as required. All current public health orders that have been put in place by the chief medical officer of health remain in force.

New measures include:

Providing the province and municipalities with flexibility and authority to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and future provincial emergencies, including to suspend or modify permit requirements for temporary facilities such as drive-thru COVID-19 testing sites.
Extending the deadline for the public release of Alberta’s annual report and financial statements to Aug. 31.
Ensuring Albertans retain their rights to appeal claims related to private career colleges in the courts or for the Government of Alberta to make claims related to

student financial assistance.

Extending the grace period of expired board member appointments to the Apprenticeship and Industry Training Board from three to five months after the term expires to allow time for a safe recruitment process.

Full details of Bill 24 are available online.

Le projet de loi 24, la loi modifiant les lois de lutte contre la pandémie de COVID-19 (COVID-19 Pandemic Response Statutes Amendment Act) vise à proposer des mesures pour aider la population albertaine alors que la province poursuit sa relance.
Le projet de loi propose la modification de 15 lois dans sept ministères. Les modifications sont proposées maintenant, puisque l’état d’urgence sanitaire est terminé.
Les modifications proposées permettront de déployer des efforts de lutte contre la pandémie afin de poursuivre les mesures d’aide à une relance de l’économie albertaine sécuritaire et fructueuse, et d’en introduire de nouvelles.

« Le projet de loi 24 nous permet de continuer de lutter efficacement contre la pandémie de COVID-19 pour protéger la santé publique et garantir à la population albertaine un accès aux services et à l’aide dont ils ont besoin, alors que le gouvernement de l’Alberta poursuit la relance de son économie. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé

Les points saillants du projet de loi comprennent la prorogation des mesures existantes, notamment :

Prolonger jusqu’en août 2021 du congé sans solde assorti d’une protection de l’emploi en lien avec la COVID-19, grâce auquel les employés peuvent prendre un congé pour s’occuper d’un enfant en raison de la fermeture des écoles et des garderies, ou pour prendre soin d’un membre de sa famille malade ou en isolement volontaire.
Fournir des conseils à jour sur le fonctionnement des programmes de garde d’enfants, notamment l’augmentation de la taille maximale des groupes de cohortes de 10 à 30 personnes (membres du personnel et enfants), aidant ainsi les exploitants à rouvrir en toute sécurité et garantissant aux parents l’accès aux services de garde d’enfants à mesure qu’ils retournent au travail.
Permettre la signature et la certification à distance de documents de succession et de gestion par vidéoconférence bidirectionnelle, garantissant aux Albertains et aux Albertaines un accès continu à la justice pendant la pandémie de COVID-19.
Prolonger le délai maximum des mises à pied temporaires associées à COVID-19 jusqu’à 180 jours au lieu de 120 jours (ce changement entrerait en vigueur en première lecture).
Prolonger les dispositions qui appuient l’ordonnance no 10 de la médecin hygiéniste en chef qui permet à un établissement de santé de limiter le nombre d’employés travaillant à un seul emplacement.
Prolonger l’utilisation des pouvoirs d’urgence pendant 60 jours supplémentaires, maintenant que l’état d’urgence pour la santé publique a pris fin, et proroger les ordonnances ministérielles existantes pour continuer à protéger la santé de la population albertaine durant la relance.
Créer un nouveau pouvoir de réglementation pour appuyer et autoriser les ordonnances de la médecin hygiéniste en chef, au besoin. Toutes les ordonnances de santé publique délivrées par la médecin hygiéniste en chef restent en vigueur.

Les nouvelles mesures comprennent notamment :

Modifier les exigences relatives aux installations de santé temporaires associées à la pandémie, y compris l’autorisation d’exemptions pour les installations temporaires comme les centres de dépistage de la COVID-19 au volant.
Proroger la date limite de publication du rapport annuel et des états financiers du gouvernement de l’Alberta jusqu’au 31 août.
Veiller à ce que les Albertains et les Albertaines aient toujours le droit d’interjeter appel auprès des tribunaux des réclamations relatives aux collèges privés d’enseignement professionnel ou que le gouvernement de l’Alberta puisse présenter des réclamations concernant l’aide financière aux étudiants.
Prolonger la période de grâce des nominations ayant expirées des membres du Apprenticeship and Industry Training Board (conseil de l’apprentissage et de la formation en industrielle) jusqu’à cinq mois au lieu de trois mois après l’expiration du mandat pour qu’un processus de recrutement sécuritaire puisse être suivi.

Tous les détails du projet de loi 24 sont disponibles en ligne (en anglais seulement).

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




These camps have been affected in a unique way due to the COVID-19 pandemic, losing revenue while incurring ongoing overhead costs such as insurance, security systems and utilities to maintain facilities and prevent damage. Under the Overnight Camps (for Children and Youth) Facility Overhead Funding Program, non-profit organizations that own or operate overnight camps and meet criteria will be able to apply for a one-time grant to help with ongoing facility costs so they can open next year.

“Overnight camps play a vital role in providing recreation and cultural experiences, education, social interaction and skill development for Alberta’s children and youth. Many camps will not survive a full year of lost revenue, which would be devastating for our children and youth who are struggling without school, their friends or extracurricular activities. This funding for overnight camps is an important investment in our kids to ensure the excitement and lifelong memories of an overnight camp experience are there for our kids next summer.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women


“Overnight camps for children are invaluable to the holistic well-being of children and the staff that service them. As a mother of campers, a teacher, former camp staff member and camp board member, I have seen for the past 20 years how camps across Alberta instil and develop skills and values in our children critical to citizenship. Most importantly, they develop extensive relationship skills that foster community building and contribute to inclusion, open-mindedness, caring for others of all ages, leadership and confidence. Camps teach our children to live lives of integrity and critical awareness. Camp gives children and staff time in our environment in which they learn to appreciate nature and be balanced as people who contribute to the common good.”
Shanley Mercer, parent and former camp staff member

The one-time grant program addresses a number of funding gaps compounded by the summer closure of overnight camps. Overnight camps are not typically eligible for existing federal or provincial pandemic response funding, and because they are usually remote or rural, they cannot generate revenue through day programming or rental of space. However, non-profit organizations that operate other public spaces, such as community halls, sport, recreation and cultural facilities, will be able to operate their facilities and generate revenue in some capacity in stages two and three of Alberta’s relaunch.

“We are so thrilled the province sees our industry as invaluable to our communities. This grant will go a long way to helping us maintain overnight camping in Alberta in the years to come. We are so appreciative. Our camp was very concerned about celebrating our 65th anniversary in 2021. This money can help erase that doubt.”
Stacy Shaikin, camp director, Camp BB Riback


“Easter Seals Alberta and Camp Horizon have proudly served Albertans with disabilities and complex medical conditions for over 50 years. Due to COVID-19, we have lost all sources of revenue. We have lost all of our planned fundraising events and had to cancel all summer camps at Camp Horizon. Not only did we lose our revenue, but our campers are so disappointed to lose their summer experiences and friendships. Some of our campers have been attending Camp Horizon for over 40 years! The unfortunate reality is that we still have fixed costs just to maintain Camp Horizon and to make sure we are viable when this is all behind us. We need to maintain the facilities and many of our costs are unavoidable. We still need running water, heat and facility maintenance staff. We are committed to doing all that we can do to keep our doors open so that future generations of Albertans with disabilities can come to Camp Horizon and experience inclusion, increased self-esteem and barrier-free recreation.”
Paula Telfer, chief executive officer, Easter Seals Alberta

The Overnight Camps (for Children and Youth) Facility Overhead Funding Program will be a new stream under the Community Initiatives Program. To be eligible, an organization must own or operate permanent overnight camp facilities for children and youth and show a loss in revenue equal to or greater than their fixed overhead costs. Overnight camp organizations must also demonstrate financial need and that they are planning for their future viability.
Program details are being confirmed, and the online application is expected to be available soon. Applications will be accepted until Aug. 31.

La province apporte une aide aux camps d’été destinés aux enfants et aux jeunes afin qu'ils puissent être prêts à ouvrir en 2021.
Ces camps ont dû surmonter des défis uniques pendant la pandémie de COVID-19, car ils ont perdu des revenus tout en continuant à devoir payer des frais généraux fixes tels que les coûts liés aux assurances, aux systèmes de sécurité, à l’entretien des installations et à la prévention des dommages. Dans le cadre du programme Overnight Camps (for Children and Youth) Facility Overhead Funding Program (programme de financement des frais généraux des camps d’été destinés aux enfants et aux jeunes), les organismes sans but lucratif qui sont propriétaires ou qui gèrent des camps d’été et qui répondent aux critères établis pourront demander une subvention unique pour les aider à couvrir les frais permanents des installations, afin qu'ils puissent ouvrir l'année prochaine.

« Les camps d’été jouent un rôle essentiel en offrant aux enfants et aux jeunes de l'Alberta des expériences récréatives, culturelles et éducatives, en plus d’occasions d’interactions sociales et de développement des compétences. De nombreux camps ne survivront pas à une année complète sans revenus, ce qui serait dévastateur pour nos enfants et nos jeunes qui ont de la difficulté à se priver de leur vie à école, de leurs amis ou de leurs activités extrascolaires. Ce financement des camps d’été est un investissement important pour nos enfants, car il leur garantira que l'excitation et les souvenirs de toute une vie créés dans ces camps d’été seront possibles dès l'été prochain. »
Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine


« Les camps d’été sont inestimables pour le bien-être général des enfants et du personnel qui les sert. En tant que mère de campeurs, enseignante, ancienne membre du personnel et du conseil d'administration d'un camp, j'ai vu, au cours des 20 dernières années, comment les camps de l'Alberta inculquent et développent chez nos enfants des compétences et des valeurs essentielles à la citoyenneté. En plus, ils développent des compétences relationnelles solides qui favorisent le rapprochement de la communauté et qui contribuent à l'inclusion, à l'ouverture d'esprit, au leadeurship, à la confiance en soi et à la prise en charge d’autres individus de tous âges. Les camps apprennent à nos enfants à vivre une vie intègre et à développer leur sens critique. Ils permettent aux enfants et au personnel de passer du temps dans le milieu naturel, qu’ils apprennent à apprécier, et à développer leur équilibre mental de façon à contribuer au bien commun. »
Shanley Mercer, parent et ancienne employée de camp

Le programme de subvention unique vise à combler un certain nombre de lacunes de financement aggravées par la fermeture estivale des camps d’été. Ces camps ne sont généralement pas admissibles aux programmes de financement fédéraux ou provinciaux créés en réponse à la pandémie et, parce qu'ils se tiennent généralement en milieu éloigné ou rural, ils ne peuvent pas générer de revenus par le biais de programmes de jour ou de location de leurs locaux. Toutefois, les organismes sans but lucratif qui exploitent d'autres espaces publics, comme des salles communautaires, des installations sportives, récréatives et culturelles, pourront exploiter leurs installations et générer des revenus à un titre ou à un autre au cours des deuxième et troisième étapes de la relance de l'Alberta.

« Nous sommes ravis que la province considère notre industrie comme inestimable pour nos communautés. Cette subvention nous aidera grandement à maintenir les camps d’été en Alberta dans les années à venir. Nous en sommes très reconnaissants. Notre organisme était très préoccupé à l’idée de ne pas pouvoir célébrer le 65e anniversaire de son camp en 2021. Cet argent pourra aider à éliminer cette crainte. »
Stacy Shaikin, directrice du Camp BB Riback


« Easter Seals Alberta et Camp Horizon sont fiers de servir les Albertaines et les Albertains handicapés et souffrant de troubles médicaux complexes depuis plus de 50 ans. En raison de la COVID-19, nous avons perdu toutes nos sources de revenus. Nous avons dû annuler tous nos événements de collecte de fonds ainsi que tous les camps d'été du Camp Horizon. Non seulement avons-nous perdu nos revenus, mais en plus, nos campeurs sont extrêmement déçus d’être privés de leurs expériences d'été et de leurs amitiés. Certains de nos campeurs participent à Camp Horizon depuis plus de 40 ans! La triste réalité est que nous avons encore des coûts fixes pour maintenir le Camp Horizon et pour nous assurer que nous serons viables quand tout cela sera derrière nous. Nous devons maintenir les installations et bon nombre de nos frais sont inévitables. Nous avons toujours besoin d'eau courante, de chauffage et de personnel d'entretien des installations. Nous nous engageons à faire tout ce que nous pouvons pour garder nos portes ouvertes afin que les futures générations d'Albertaines et d’Albertains handicapés puissent venir au Camp Horizon et faire l'expérience de l'intégration, d'une meilleure estime de soi et de loisirs sans obstacles. »
Paula Telfer, directrice générale, Easter Seals Alberta

Le Overnight Camps (for Children and Youth) Facility Overhead Funding Program sera un nouveau volet du Community Initiatives Program (programme d'initiatives communautaires). Pour être admissible, un organisme doit posséder ou exploiter des installations permanentes de camp d’été pour les enfants et les jeunes et présenter une perte de revenus égale ou supérieure à ses frais généraux fixes. Les organismes de camps d’été doivent également démontrer qu’ils ont un besoin de financement réel et qu’ils planifient leur viabilité future.
Les détails du programme sont en cours de confirmation, et le processus de demande devrait être offert en ligne prochainement. Les candidatures seront acceptées jusqu'au 31 août.

For the past 20 years, individuals with ALS have only had one approved drug treatment option.

“With only one medication available for this progressive neurodegenerative disease, providing Albertans with another treatment option is vital. June is ALS Awareness Month and providing access to this new drug is the best way to demonstrate our support for those living with ALS.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

ALS is an illness involving progressive paralysis of an individual’s voluntary muscles. Its cause is unknown. Symptoms of ALS often include loss of motor control, muscle weakness, fatigue, stiffness, muscle cramping and twitching.
Drug treatment may help to slow a patient’s loss of function and mobility, enabling them to better manage the disease and improve their quality of life.

“We applaud the Alberta government for providing Albertans with access to Radicava through government-sponsored drug coverage. The availability of new drug therapies is critical for people living with this terminal disease and gives hope for new treatments. This is a significant milestone for Albertans affected by ALS.”
Karen Caughey, Executive Director, ALS Society of Alberta

The evaluation program will better track vendor performance to ensure the delivery of quality housing for seniors and other Albertans with low income is on time and on budget. Timely feedback will ensure vendors identify and address issues early. Evaluation results will be valuable when considering vendors for future contracts.
The formal process will evaluate the performance of vendors granted contracts by the Alberta Social Housing Corporation.

“Our ability to track, analyze and manage the performance of a vendor will ensure fairness and help us mitigate risks and enable improvement throughout the term of contracts. The program will help us deliver high-quality housing for seniors and other Albertans with low income, and provide prudent fiscal management of public funds.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“The Alberta Construction Association applauds Alberta Seniors and Housing for adopting the vendor performance framework developed by Alberta Infrastructure with industry input. Consistent rules and reporting reduce red tape and costs. Seniors and Housing is a good business partner.”
Ken Gibson, executive director, Alberta Construction Association

Quick facts

Beginning in June, the vendor performance management program will be used to evaluate planning, design and major construction contracts.
The program will be reviewed annually.

ASIRT’s investigation was comprehensive, thorough and conducted using current investigative protocols. ASIRT interviewed all relevant police and civilian witnesses, including all subject officers who provided voluntary statements. Additionally, the investigation was aided considerably by the availability of significant, high-quality Watchguard video from a number of the RCMP vehicles.
On March 25, 2018, a 22-year-old woman, Nadia El-Dib, was found deceased behind a home in Calgary. An autopsy confirmed that she had been the victim of a particularly violent attack involving the use of an edged weapon and a firearm. The Calgary Police Service (CPS) investigators quickly identified a suspect: a 21-year-old man who had briefly dated the young woman and was associated with the residence behind which she was found. A warrant was issued for the man for the offence of first-degree murder. He remained at large and was believed to be armed and dangerous.
On the morning of March 29, CPS advised RCMP officers that evidence placed the fugitive in the Evansburg area. He was believed to be armed with a CSA VZ.58 semi-automatic rifle and driving a dark blue 2004 Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle. The man had made statements to the effect that he would not go down without a fight. This information was shared with RCMP officers in the detachments west of Edmonton along the Highway 16 corridor.
At 5:13 p.m., while heading home at the end of his shift, an RCMP officer in full uniform and operating a black Chevrolet Tahoe, discreetly marked with black (shadow) reflective strips in the standard RCMP design pattern, encountered the blue Ford Explorer and began following the vehicle, calling in that they were now northbound on Highway 22, about 15 kilometres south of Highway 16. Efforts to conduct a traffic stop of the vehicle were not successful and at 5:17 p.m., a police pursuit ensued.
The pursuit continued for approximately 70 minutes and covered approximately 140 kilometres, traveling north on Highway 22 onto Highway 16. The pursuit travelled east and west on Highway 16 as the man changed direction on the highway several times. As the pursuit continued, additional officers and police vehicles joined in. RCMP coordinated the response so that additional officers were positioned at intersections ahead of the pursuit to prevent civilians from accessing the highway and entering into the potentially dangerous ongoing event, and to prevent the man from escaping onto rural roads.
The man successfully evaded four separate attempts to deploy spike belts during the pursuit. A fifth spike belt, placed on Highway 16 eastbound at Range Road 112, succeeded in damaging the vehicle’s tires but the man was able to drive further until his vehicle became inoperable and stopped just east of Range Road 83, in the eastbound lanes of Highway 16.
As the vehicle slowed down, the man made a sharp 45-degree turn, coming to a stop angled across a portion of the outside eastbound lane of the highway, exposing the passenger side of the vehicle to the pursuing police vehicles. The placement of the vehicle provided a tactically advantageous position, providing cover and protection while the man fired upon police.
When the man’s vehicle stopped, the officer immediately behind noted traffic in the westbound lanes of Highway 16 and deliberately parked his police vehicle near the left shoulder in the eastbound lanes to limit the man’s ability to flee across the median into the westbound lanes and also to prevent him from flanking police. As the closest police vehicle, the officer stopped approximately 17.4 metres away from the Ford Explorer. The remaining pursuing RCMP vehicles stopped in a staggered pattern on the highway behind the Explorer.
Civilian witnesses travelling in the westbound lanes of Highway 16 reported seeing the man exit his vehicle with what was described as a rifle or “machine gun,” and immediately drop to one knee to take a firing stance, pointing at police ”like he knew what he was doing.”
The man immediately fired a shot at the closest RCMP vehicle, while the officer was exiting his marked police vehicle. The man again fired upon that officer, causing a head injury. It was immediately apparent to some of the nearby RCMP officers that this officer had been shot, and that he appeared to have some sort of head injury that was bleeding profusely, though his initial status was unknown.
As soon as the man began firing on the officers, officers took positions of cover and eleven of the officers returned fire, firing multiple rounds from assorted duty firearms. It was difficult for the officers to assess whether they had disabled the man, as he was behind the vehicle and hard to see. What followed was an exchange of gunfire between RCMP officers and the man that lasted for about two minutes. During the firefight, independent witnesses saw that the man appeared to be reloading his firearm as he sheltered behind his disabled vehicle. He fired additional rounds at the RCMP officers/vehicles from a position of cover behind the driver’s side of the Ford Explorer. One minute and twelve seconds after the start of the gunfire, one of the officers near the front waved his arm, directing officers to “cease fire.” One last shot was fired, when an officer perceived movement.
During the firefight, the injured officer crawled towards the back of his police vehicle, hampered by the head injury and blood obscuring his vision. He was pulled to safety through the concerted efforts of multiple officers to provide cover and physical assistance.
Given the man had considerable cover behind his vehicle, officers were challenged to aim through available access points including windows, over the top of the vehicle and underneath the undercarriage of the vehicle. A ceasefire was called once the officers believed that the man had been incapacitated. At 6:28 p.m., an officer travelling in the westbound lanes came upon the scene and confirmed that the man appeared to be down. Based on the available evidence, the man had fired 10 rounds, while a total of 202 police rounds are believed to have been fired between the eleven subject officers.
The injured officer suffered what would turn out, miraculously, to be only a grazing wound across the top of his head, leaving his skull intact, with shrapnel in his scalp and a concussion. He received stitches and remained in hospital for a number of days as a precautionary measure. A second officer on scene suffered several lacerations or abrasions on his arm and the back of the neck, believed to be from shrapnel from nearby bullet strikes.
The relatively minor nature of the officers’ injuries was a reflection of good fortune rather than a lack of intent on the part of the man. There can be no doubt that he had been firing on police with the intent to kill or seriously injure as many officers as possible.
The blue Ford Explorer suffered extensive damage: every window was shot out and the body of the vehicle had taken numerous bullet strikes. Three police vehicles also sustained damage from bullet strikes.
An autopsy determined that the man died of multiple gunshot wounds. One of the most serious gunshot wounds severed the cervical spinal cord, and lacerated both the left common carotid artery and left internal jugular. A toxicology report determined that the man had neither drugs nor alcohol in his system at the time of his death.
The man had no prior criminal record. The CSA VZ.58 semi-automatic rifle, which was the weapon believed to have been used in the murder of Ms. El-Dib, was recovered on scene and found to have an empty magazine but one remaining live round in the chamber. The gun and its ammunition had the capacity to penetrate police soft body armour. A receipt recovered from the man’s wallet demonstrated that his gun had been purchased on May 10, 2018, along with a membership to a Calgary gun club.
 
CSA VZ.58 Semi-Automatic Rifle Recovered from Scene

Under the Criminal Code, police officers are granted certain powers and authorities to facilitate the performance of what can be a challenging job. Under S. 25 of the Criminal Code, a police officer is authorized to use as much force as is reasonably necessary in administration or enforcement of the law. This can, in limited circumstances, include force that is intended or likely to cause grievous bodily harm or death. Resort to lethal force is only authorized in circumstances where an officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.
Further, under S. 34 of the Criminal Code, any person, including a police officer, is entitled to the use of reasonable force in defence of themselves or another person.
In order for a police officer’s use of force not only to be authorized but protected, the officer must be acting in the lawful execution of his or her duties, a principle often referred to as “lawful placement.” In this particular case, there is no question that all involved officers were acting in the lawful execution of their duties. All were involved in the attempted apprehension of the man, for whom a warrant had been issued in the public interest for the offence of first-degree murder. They were lawfully entitled to arrest him. Factoring in the homicide, the man’s stated intentions to evade apprehension and his behaviour during the attempted traffic stop, it is no understatement to suggest that he presented a high risk to public safety. It is also beyond dispute that the man understood that he was dealing with members of law enforcement.
It would be fair to describe this event as harrowing. It is a shocking example of the risks police can face at any time. While the man was extremely young and had no criminal record, factors that might suggest an easier or less risky apprehension, the calculated positioning of his vehicle permitted him to fire on police from a position of cover which prolonged the incident. His choice to open fire on officers was deliberate and immediate, and there can be no question that he presented a lethal risk. He was shooting to kill, not just to provoke a police response.
In the circumstances, viewing the incident as a whole, the eleven officers’ resort to the use of lethal force, made only upon the man’s firing first upon police, was reasonable and justified. The risk presented by these actions was both serious and immediate. These actions, both objectively and subjectively, risked grievous bodily harm or death to the officers who were present, and accordingly, the decision by subject officers to fire their service weapons was both lawful and justified. When considering the number of shots fired by police, one must be mindful of the chaos created by both police and the man firing weapons at the same time, the difficulty police had in determining whether the man had been injured or incapacitated, and the precious seconds it took for officers to recognize that the threat presented by the man had been addressed.
Having reviewed the investigation in its entirety, there are no reasonable grounds, nor reasonable suspicion, to believe any of the involved officers committed any offences. As such, the officers will not be charged with any offences arising out of this incident.
It is a tragedy when a life is lost. While the loss of life is never the desired outcome, the man placed the officers in a situation where lethal force was necessary. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a situation that would be a better example of the necessity for the use of lethal force. The man was an active shooter, using lethal force and was deliberately trying to kill others. He needed to be stopped before he succeeded. A dangerous person who presented considerable risk to everyone, civilians and officers alike, was contained and stopped before he could do more harm. This is an example of officers placing themselves in harm’s way to protect others and, indeed, nearly paying the highest price.
At the end of the day, no members of the public were caught up in this incident or harmed. The police officers who voluntarily put themselves in harm’s way that day were able to return to their families. Responsibility for the death of the affected person falls solely on him, even though officers were the mechanism he used to achieve that result.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

The successful reopening of the Royal Alberta Museum and Royal Tyrrell Museum has paved the way towards the reopening of many more provincial sites.

“Albertans are truly eager to get back out and explore the province’s history. Having more sites open across the province will give people the chance to venture out with friends and family, play tourist in their own region and help support the local economy. With this reopening, we are urging all to follow physical distancing and hygiene protocols as they once again enjoy local food, culture and heritage.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women

Visitor guidelines vary by site
The following facilities will reopen on June 20:

Frank Slide Interpretive Centre
Oil Sands Discovery Centre
Remington Carriage Museum
Reynolds-Alberta Museum
Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village

The Provincial Archives of Alberta will reopen on June 23.
Because each site is unique, patrons are encouraged to visit the facility’s website to review visitor guidelines before arrival.

D'autres lieux historiques et musées provinciaux rouvriront le 20 juin dans le cadre de la deuxième étape de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta.
La réouverture réussie du Musée royal de l’Alberta et musée de paléontologie Royal Tyrrell a ouvert la voie à la réouverture de nombreux autres lieux provinciaux.

«Les Albertaines et les Albertains ont vraiment hâte de repartir à la découverte de l'histoire de la province. L'ouverture d'un plus grand nombre d’attractions dans toute la province donnera aux gens la possibilité de s'aventurer avec leurs amis et leur famille, de faire du tourisme dans leur propre région et de contribuer à soutenir l'économie locale. Avec l’annonce de ces réouvertures, nous demandons à tous et à toutes de suivre les protocoles d'éloignement physique et d'hygiène établis lorsqu’ils recommenceront à tirer plaisir de la nourriture, de la culture et du patrimoine locaux.»
Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine

Comme chaque endroit est unique, nous encourageons les clients à consulter les sites Web des établissements pour prendre connaissance des directives qui s’y appliquent, et ce, avant leur arrivée. Les visiteurs pourraient devoir réserver leurs billets, et certaines expositions interactives et certains petits bâtiments pourraient être fermés. Tous les lieux ont réduit leur capacité d’accueil, instauré des mesures d'éloignement et augmenté l’accès au désinfectant pour les mains sur place.
Directives générales pour les visiteurs

Ne visitez pas un lieu historique ou un musée si vous présentez des symptômes liés à la COVID-19 ou si vous ne vous sentez pas bien.
Continuez à visiter le site alberta.ca/COVID19 (en anglais seulement) pour obtenir des renseignements et des directives à jour sur le lavage des mains, l'éloignement physique et les mesures d’hygiène à suivre.
Nous encourageons les visiteurs à porter des masques non médicaux lorsqu'ils se trouvent dans des lieux publics où il est difficile de garder une distance minimale de deux mètres des autres.
Utilisez les stations de désinfection des mains et les installations de lavage des mains situées sur place.
Soyez vigilant en utilisant les expositions interactives et évitez de vous entasser autour des expositions.
Suivez tous les panneaux de direction ou d'instruction affichés.

Certaines installations resteront fermées jusqu'à nouvel ordre
Compte tenu de leur nature et de leurs espaces resserrés, certains lieux historiques ne sont pas en mesure de mettre en œuvre les mesures et procédures nécessaires pour respecter en toute sécurité les lignes directrices en matière de santé publique. Les installations suivantes resteront donc fermées au public jusqu'à nouvel ordre :

la Chapelle du Père Lacombe
le Fort George and Buckingham House (centre d’interprétation du fort George et de la maison Buckingham)
le Précipice à bisons Head-Smashed-In
l’Historic Dunvegan (parc provincial Historic Dunvegan)
la Rutherford House (lieu historique provincial Rutherford House)

Alberta will administer the Canadian Firearms Program by appointing its own chief provincial firearms officer rather than having it administered by the federal government. A provincially appointed chief firearms officer will replace the federally designated chief firearms officer, giving the province a greater role in the administration of firearms policy. Appointing its own chief provincial firearms officer will provide the province increased responsibilities to reflect Albertans’ long history of responsible firearms use and ownership.

“By appointing a provincial chief firearms officer, Alberta is asserting its provincial jurisdiction. It is also a step towards a system of firearms administration in the province that is rooted in the values and priorities of law-abiding Albertans. In Alberta, we will ensure we have a system of firearms policies and governance measures that protect Albertans, prosecute criminals and deter illegal gun crime rather than persecuting law-abiding citizens.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“We have heard loud and clear that Albertans are frustrated with policies designed for downtown Toronto and want a system that works better for Alberta. A provincially appointed chief firearms officer would better meet the needs and priorities of Albertans while improving services for law-abiding gun owners.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


“Albertans are unhappy with Ottawa putting politics ahead of public safety. If the Government of Canada wants to step up the fight against gun crime, the obvious place to start is to target the illegal gun smugglers who are arming gangs and fuelling violence in our communities. It makes far more sense than wasting millions of taxpayers’ dollars buying back legal firearms from responsible, trained, and fully licensed firearms owners. I am pleased that Alberta’s government is taking a stand against this heavy-handed policy by working to appoint our own chief firearms officer.”
Jason Nixon, Government House Leader


“As chair of the Alberta Firearms Advisory Committee, I look forward to working with law-abiding farmers, hunters and sport-shooters to provide thoughtful recommendations to the chief provincial firearms officer to craft sensible policies that reflect the needs of Alberta’s firearms owners. Our government was hired in record numbers on a mandate that speaks to the issues that matter most to Albertans. Appointing a chief provincial firearms officer will fulfil one of our key campaign commitments.”
Michaela Glasgo, MLA for Brooks-Medicine Hat, and chair, Alberta Firearms Advisory Committee


“Our organization believes that the ultimate goal of firearms policy needs to be ‘safe streets and safe communities.’ If asserting provincial jurisdiction contributes positively to that goal, then we are supportive of it. Responsible firearms ownership and respect for property rights of law-abiding citizens need to be cornerstones of any actions we take.”
Robert Gruszecki, president, Alberta Hunter Education Instructors’ Association

Over the next year, the government will work to establish the firearms office and how it will ensure the needs of Albertans are considered in the provincial administration of the Firearms Act, as well as work with Public Safety Canada to ensure a seamless transition. The chief provincial firearms office is expected to be in place in 2021.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.





The Fair Deal Panel report recommends 25 ways to ensure Alberta has a stronger voice in Confederation, including fairer funding allocations from Ottawa, better representation for Alberta in the House of Commons, and exploration of an Alberta Pension Plan and Alberta Police Force.
More than 40,000 Albertans participated in the Fair Deal Panel engagement, providing input on ideas that could give the province a stronger role within Canada, increase control in areas of provincial jurisdiction and advance our province’s vital economic interests. The panel’s report to government contains 25 separate recommendations that address the frustrations many Albertans shared with the panel.

“Albertans have told us what a fair deal looks like for our province – it consists of more autonomy, better representation and a renewed respect for all provinces and territories. Our government agrees, and work on many of these areas is already underway. We are eager to take further action on the panel’s recommendations to ensure Albertans have a strong voice and a fair deal when we need it most.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Government has already taken action or started work on a number of initiatives related to the panel’s recommendations, such as moving forward on reforming the Fiscal Stabilization Program, establishing a provincial chief firearms officer, and working with other provinces and territories to further explore the development of economic resource corridors to move our products to market. Government is committed to further analyzing all the recommendations to ensure they get the attention they deserve.

“Working with Albertans and hearing their stories, frustrations and ideas about how to empower our province on the national stage has been an incredible honour. Albertans told us they want government to take action to strengthen the province and assert our jurisdiction, so I think they’ll be pleased with just how much work is happening in the areas they stressed as top priorities.”
Oryssia Lennie, chair, Fair Deal Panel


“Albertans know we’ve been getting a raw deal and that there is no fair deal without tackling equalization, so it’s great to see the Fair Deal Panel acknowledge the importance of the equalization referendum. There’s still a lot more work to do, but this report and the equalization referendum are the crucial first few steps in Alberta’s fight for fairness.”
Franco Terrazzano, Alberta director, Canadian Taxpayers Federation.


“As a group of businesses who believe in our province and our country, we are very supportive of the report and Alberta getting a fair deal. Everyone will win when we can strengthen inter-provincial trade and build our country by making Confederation fairer. We believe that the Fair Deal report is a step in that direction.”
John Liston, president, Alberta Enterprise Group

Actions to date
Since being elected, the government has kept its word to secure a fair deal for Alberta with concrete actions to implement platform commitments, including:
Carbon Tax Repeal
Commitment: 

“Introduce the Carbon Tax Repeal Act, and challenge the constitutionality of the federal carbon tax by filing a judicial reference to the Court of Appeal, while continuing to support similar challenges by the governments of Saskatchewan and Ontario.”

Action: 

Passed the Carbon Tax Repeal Act, effective May 30, 2019, and secured a declaration from the Alberta Appeal Court that the federal carbon tax is unconstitutional. Also supporting appeals by Saskatchewan and Ontario on the federal carbon tax to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Pipelines
Commitment: 

“Immediately file a constitutional challenge to strike the federal government’s ‘No More Pipelines’ Bill C-69 as a violation of Section 92 of the Constitution Act, which gives Alberta clear, exclusive jurisdiction over the production of oil and gas.”

Action:

Filed a constitutional challenge of Bill C-69 at the Alberta Court of Appeal. Decision is pending. 

Market Access
Commitment:

“To proclaim into law Preserving Canada’s Economic Prosperity Act, to make it clear that Alberta will defend the value of its resources against provincial governments that seek to block pipelines.”

Action: 

Proclaimed the Preserving Canada’s Economic Prosperity Act on April 30, 2019.

Indigenous participation in resource development
Commitment: 

“Create a $10 million litigation fund to support pro-development Indigenous communities in defending their right to be consulted on major energy projects.”

Action: 

Alberta created the Indigenous Litigation Fund which is now supporting the Woodland Cree First Nation’s constitutional challenge of the federal “tanker ban” Bill C-69.
The government further supports Indigenous participation through the creation of the Indigenous Opportunities Corporation, backed by up to $1 billion to support Indigenous financial participation in major resource projects.

CMHC stress test:
Commitment:

“Challenge the federal government’s unfair one-size-fits-all approach to mortgages by demanding Canada Mortgage and Home Corporation (CMHC) stress tests are removed from Alberta residents.”

Action:

Alberta has worked to continually advocate for changes to the CMHC stress test, which through its unilateral application does not reflect the needs of Alberta homebuyers. While the federal government announced changes to the program, they still do not take into account the different circumstances of the Alberta housing market and continue to disadvantage Alberta homebuyers and make it even more difficult for Albertans to qualify for CMHC mortgage insurance.

Employment Insurance reforms:
Commitment: 

“Demand reforms to Canada’s Employment Insurance (EI) program so that Albertans who lose their jobs are not penalized and treated unfairly compared to other Canadians.”

Action:

Alberta has continued to raise this issue with the federal government, most recently during the December 2019 Ministers’ Mission to Ottawa. At that time, Alberta noted that Alberta employers and workers consistently pay more into the EI program than they receive. Alberta would like EI program reform to ensure equitable treatment of Albertans who lose their jobs and employers who pay EI premiums.

Development of an Alberta Parole Board
Commitment: 

“End Alberta’s agreement with the Parole Board of Canada and pass legislation to create an Alberta Parole Board.”

Action:

In June 2020, Alberta announced our intention to create our own parole board to provide a fairer, faster and more responsive justice system that helps end the “revolving door” that enables repeat offenders to target Albertans, particularly in rural areas.

Resource corridors:
Commitment:

“Seek to form federal and provincial agreement on resource corridors, which are pre-approved land corridors to expedite major resource project approvals; a key part of these corridors would be facilitating aboriginal co-ownership of financial participation, where relevant.”

Action: 

After Premier Kenney raised this topic at the Summer 2019 Council of the Federation (COF) meeting, all jurisdictions agreed to do further work on this concept. Alberta officials are working with other provinces and territories to prepare a report that explores ways to enhance the existing connections between provinces and territories to provide a more co-ordinated and strategic approach for transportation and transmission of resources across Canada. This report will be presented to premiers in advance of the 2020 COF meeting, and will provide options for future collaborative work.

Canadian free trade
Commitment: 

“Support the vital rights of Canadians to sell their goods and services and exercise their trades and professions in every part of Canada.”

Action: 

Alberta has unilaterally scrapped 21 of 27 exemptions under the Canada Free Trade Agreement, becoming the province with the lowest internal trade barriers.
Led an effort to expand Central and Eastern Canadian provinces in the New West Partnership Agreement.
Continuing policy work on the potential unilateral recognition of Canadian trade and professional certification. 

National support for pipelines:
Commitment:

“Build an interprovincial coalition of provinces that supports jobs pipelines, and our energy industry, making it a top issue in federal-provincial relations.”

Action:

Secured support from 12 of 13 provinces and territories for “national resource and energy corridors, including oil and gas pipelines.” 

Fair Deal Panel recommendations and actions underway
Recommendation 1: Press strenuously for the removal of the current constraints on the Fiscal Stabilization Program, which prevent Albertans from receiving a $2.4 billion equalization rebate.
Action

The Government of Alberta advocated for retroactive changes to the Fiscal Stabilization Program at the December 2019 Council of the Federation meeting, where all provinces and territories agreed to support changes to the program, including a retroactive rebate to address the unfair per capital cap on payments that affects jurisdictions such as Alberta. The province has raised this demand with the Government of Canada as a central issue over the past year.
A Fair Deal for Alberta, a chapter in Budget 2020 dedicated to federal-provincial fiscal issues, outlined Alberta’s case for reforming the Fiscal Stabilization Program.

Recommendation 2: Proceed with the proposed referendum on equalization, asking a clear question along the lines of: “Do you support the removal of Section 36, which deals with the principle of equalization, from the Constitution Act, 1982?”
Action:

Agreed to in principle.
Further work will be done to analyze what an appropriate referendum question on equalization would be.
This referendum could be held in conjunction with the 2021 municipal elections.

Recommendation 3: Collaborate with other jurisdictions to reduce trade barriers within Canada and pressure the federal government to enforce free trade in Canada.
Action:

Alberta has taken a leadership role in reducing trade barriers within Canada:
	
In 2019, Alberta lifted 21 trade exceptions under the Canada Free Trade Agreement and narrowed two others to become the jurisdiction with the fewest number of exceptions in Canada.


Alberta continues to call on the federal government and other jurisdictions to follow Alberta’s lead and eliminate trade barriers, is leading efforts to expand the New West Partnership Trade Agreement (NWPTA) to include other provinces, and continues work on the possible unilateral recognition of trade and professional qualifications.

Recommendation 4: Collaborate with other jurisdictions and stakeholders to secure cross-border rights-of-way and create unobstructed resource corridors within Canada to tidewater and world markets.
Action:

Alberta secured unanimous support from western and northern premiers for “energy and resource corridors, including oil and gas pipelines,” and unanimous agreement amongst all 13 premiers at the Council of the Federation to support “economic corridors (to) expand markets for Canadian energy, including hydroelectricity and natural gas.”
	
All jurisdictions have agreed to do further work on this concept, and Alberta officials continue to work with other provinces and territories to provide a more co-ordinated and strategic approach for transporting and transmitting resources across Canada.
A report on this work will be presented to premiers in advance of the 2020 Council of the Federation meeting.


Alberta is participating in the work of the Pan-Canadian Competitive Trade Corridor Initiative.
	
Ministers responsible for Transportation and Highways across Canada are working to find ways to enhance internal and international trade.


Government provided a grant to the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy to support its Canadian Northern Corridor Program.
Alberta will create a task force to work with industry, First Nations, municipalities and other provinces to move resource corridors from concept to reality.

Recommendation 5: Collaborate with other jurisdictions to design and advance regional strategies for northern development; pressure the federal government to implement those strategies.
Action:

The Northern Alberta Development Council (NADC) is a public agency accountable to the Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism. Its ongoing work includes investigating, monitoring, evaluating, planning and promoting practical measures to foster and advance development in northern Alberta.
	
The NADC will continue to focus on the development of one or more multi-modal corridors across the north, which would include broadband, utilities, roadways and rail.
Work has started to develop a Northern Strategy for Alberta to further develop the corridor concepts and complement the work of other provincial and territorial members of the Northern Ministers’ Development Forum.



Recommendations 6 A & B: Support and press for the strictest possible application of the principle of representation by population in the House of Commons. Work with other provinces and the federal government to democratize the Senate appointment process.
Action:

Government recently reintroduced the Senatorial Selection Act to ensure a democratic appointment process for current and future Senate appointments.

	
Senate elections will be held in conjunction with the 2021 municipal elections.


Work on a request to the federal government advocating for a more representative share of House of Commons seats is currently underway.

Recommendation 7: Secure a fairer share of federal civil service opportunities and federal offices in Western Canada.
Action:

This recommendation requires further analysis and work before it can be implemented.
	
Executive Council will develop a plan to address this recommendation.



Recommendation 8: Abolish or at least change the residency requirement for the federal courts.
Action:

Agreed to in principle.
Alberta will immediately begin to advocate for the elimination of the long-standing and archaic rule to have federal court judges reside within the National Capital Region, which has unfairly punished Alberta residents.

Recommendation 9: Assert more control over immigration for the economic benefit of Alberta.
Action:

Agreed to in principle.
Alberta will continue to advocate for economic policies that strengthen Alberta, including immigration policies.
	
The province will seek a more active role in setting immigration numbers and policies with the federal government as part of the Alberta Advantage Immigration Strategy.



Recommendation 10: Collaborate with other provinces and industry to advance market-based approaches to environment protection, including a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Action:

Alberta continues to work with other jurisdictions that share the common objective of ensuring climate change response plans are locally developed and reflective of the unique circumstances in each province and territory. This includes balancing energy development with the need to address climate change.
Government has worked with industry and stakeholders to develop the Technology Innovation and Emission Reduction regulation for large emitters, which supports the overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in Alberta while maintaining industry competitiveness.
Alberta worked with industry and stakeholder partners to establish a provincial methane regulatory approach that is more cost-effective than proposed federal regulations.

Recommendation 11: Continue to challenge federal legislation that affects provincial jurisdiction.
Action:

Alberta succeeded in obtaining a judicial reference from the Court of Appeal declaring the federal carbon tax unconstitutional, and is awaiting a decision from the Court of Appeal challenging the constitutionality of federal Bill C-69, commonly known as the “No More Pipelines Act.”
Alberta will continue to defend its economy and constitutional jurisdiction against intrusive federal legislation as necessary.

Recommendation 12: Work with other provinces to secure a federal-provincial agreement prohibiting the federal government from spending, taxing, legislation or treaty making in areas of provincial or joint jurisdiction without the consent of the affected province(s).
Action:

Agreed to in principle.
As the Minister of Intergovernmental Relations, Premier Kenney will champion an agreement that restricts federal overreach to respect the constitutional authority of Canada’s provinces.

Recommendations 13 A & B: Develop a comprehensive plan to create an Alberta Pension Plan and withdraw from the Canada Pension Plan. Subsequently, provide Albertans the opportunity, via a referendum, to vote for or against withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan and creating the Alberta Pension Plan.
Action:

Treasury Board and Finance will develop a detailed analysis of the costs, benefits and structure of a potential Alberta Pension Plan, to be completed and released in 2021. Alberta would only proceed with the creation of a provincial pension plan if supported by a majority of voters in a referendum.

Recommendation 14: Create an Alberta Police Service to replace the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Action:

The Department of Justice and Solicitor General will commence a detailed study into the costs, benefits and structure of a potential provincial police service. This study will be completed and released in 2021.

Recommendation 15: Appoint an Alberta Chief Firearms Officer (CFO).
Action:

Alberta will appoint a provincial CFO and is starting the process of negotiating this change with the federal government.
Alberta established the Alberta Firearms Advisory Committee (AFAC) to provide recommendations on how to structure a provincial CFO.

Recommendation 16: Secure a seat at the table when the federal government negotiates and implements international agreements and treaties affecting Alberta’s interests.
Action:

Alberta has pushed the federal government for a more formal, consistent and appropriate role for the province at all international negotiations.
	
Alberta will continue this advocacy work on both an ad hoc basis (i.e. as agreements and treaties arise) and in a more deliberate fashion with the federal government.


Alberta will strenuously pursue advocacy work in this area, starting with a formal request to the federal government to ensure a seat for Alberta at the international negotiating table.

Recommendation 17: Strengthen Alberta’s presence in Ottawa.
Action:

Alberta will open advocacy offices in Ottawa and Quebec to work with elected officials; federal departments, agencies, boards and commissions; and foreign missions to advance Alberta’s interests

Recommendation 18: Opt out of new federal cost-shared programs, subject to Alberta receiving full compensation.
Action:

Alberta will seek to opt out of any federal programs that are inconsistent with Alberta’s interests, and will seek full compensation from the federal government, as appropriate.
	
This will be Alberta’s approach with respect to the proposed federal approach to pharmaceuticals.



Recommendation 19: Resist federal intrusions into health and social programming, and do not seek to exchange cash payments for tax points at this time.
Action:

The Government of Alberta committed to seeking an exchange of tax points for existing tax payments in its election platform, so this recommendation requires modification to align with an existing government commitment.
Work will proceed to scope and analyze the most effective approaches and timing for seeking such a fundamental shift in Canada’s fiscal arrangements, along with potential alternative reforms that would advance Alberta’s interests.

Recommendation 20: Continue to diversify Alberta’s economy in the energy sector and beyond.
Action:

This recommendation is accepted, and is reflected in the Government’s Blueprint for Jobs. Policies that support diversification will be further advanced in Alberta’s post-COVID Economic Recovery Strategy, to be released this summer.

Recommendation 21: Vigorously pursue access to markets for Alberta’s exports.
Action:

Government has strongly advocated for all major pipeline projects that support getting our resources to market.
	
This includes the significant $1.5 billion equity investment and $6 billion loan guarantee to accelerate construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline project.


The province has a strong international presence with 12 international offices, including Washington, D.C., and Beijing. These offices play a vital role in advancing Alberta’s interests globally through trade promotion, investment attraction and advocacy initiatives.
	
Alberta appointed James Rajotte to lead Alberta’s Washington, D.C., trade office as it advances the province’s interests and opens the American market to new Alberta exports.


Alberta will continue to vigorously pursue the completion of all pipeline projects that support getting our resources to market, including advocating for the completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project and Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Project.

Recommendation 22: Make no changes, at this time, to the administration of agreements that Alberta public agencies and municipalities have with the Government of Canada.
Action:

Working with public bodies to ensure federal funding aligns with desired provincial outcomes and has the greatest impact for Albertans is of vital importance.
	
While government does not anticipate any changes to the relationship between public agencies and other governments at this time, it is a subject that may be revisited in the future.



Recommendations 23 A & B: Make no changes to tax collection in Alberta at this time and support Quebec in its bid to collect the federal and provincial portions of personal income taxes and, if Quebec is successful, pursue the same strategy if it is advantageous.
Action:

Alberta supports Quebec in its effort to pursue the collection of both the provincial and federal portions of personal income taxes.
	
Further analysis is required on the feasibility of a provincial tax collection agency, including understanding the benefits of policy flexibility against the cost of additional compliance and administrative requirements.



Recommendation 24: Use democratic tools such as referenda and citizens’ initiatives to seek Albertans’ guidance on selected Fair Deal Panel proposals and other initiatives.
Action:

The Government of Alberta will introduce citizens’ initiative legislation, and will use referendums to consult Albertans on major issues, as appropriate.

Recommendation 25: Explore ways and means to affirm Alberta’s cultural, economic and political uniqueness in law and government policy.
Action:
Alberta accepts this recommendation. While we currently work to affirm our cultural identity, more can be done. The Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women will be tasked with developing an action plan to implement this recommendation.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Bill 23, the Commercial Tenancies Protection Act, would protect eligible commercial tenants from having their leases terminated due to non-payment of rent as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If passed, the act would also prevent landlords from raising rent and charging late fees and penalties on missed rent.
The new measures will help address shortfalls in the current Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program, and will give eligible business owners peace of mind as they reopen and help with the provincial economic recovery.

“Alberta has the most generous support models for small businesses in Canada, but we know that more supports are needed. We’re listening to Alberta’s business community, and we’re responding to their needs. If passed, these protections will provide businesses with more protection as they reopen and rehire staff as we move through the phases of relaunch and recovery.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism

The legislation and upcoming regulation would cover the period from March 17 to Aug. 31, and would apply to:

Commercial tenants with tenancy agreements that would be eligible for the CECRA program, but whose landlords have chosen not to participate.
Commercial lease agreements where tenants have had to close their business due to public health orders or have had their business revenue decline by 25 per cent or more as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If passed, any late fees, penalties or rent increases imposed on a commercial tenant by their landlord between March 17 and Aug. 31 would need to be reimbursed, however, the legislation would not undo any evictions or lease terminations that happened before the legislation was tabled.

“As small businesses move into reopening, many are facing lower revenues and fear not being able to make rent payments. Today’s announcement of commercial eviction legislation will provide a safety net for those small businesses unable to access the CECRA and will help them reopen and continue their operations.”
Annie Dormuth, Alberta provincial affairs director, Canadian Federation of Independent Business


“This moratorium legislation will reduce the anxiety and fear small businesses had of being evicted from their premises during the pandemic. Businesses who faced a potential eviction for non-payment of rent due to substantial revenue decreases can feel a bit more reassured of their chances of reopening.”
Ken Kobly, president and CEO, Alberta Chamber of Commerce


“Restaurants Canada appreciates the government coming to the table with this much-needed commercial rent protection legislation. The inability to pay rent with little or no revenue for the past few months, combined with the inability to convince landlords to participate in the CECRA program or other rent relief arrangements, is the No.1 concern for the majority of Alberta’s restaurants. The legislation introduced today will provide the time needed for restaurant tenants and their landlords to agree to long-term rent solutions without worrying about evictions.”
Mark von Schellwitz, vice-president, Western Canada, Restaurants Canada

The act would also help ensure landlords don’t miss out on deferred rent by requiring tenants and landlords to work together to develop a rent payment plan for missed payments.
Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance physical distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.
Quick facts

Many businesses have experienced a dramatic decrease in revenues, while other businesses have temporarily ceased operations as a result of COVID-19.
Rent and labour are two of the largest expenses for small businesses, typically accounting for 50 to 60 per cent of total operating expenses.
In 2016, Alberta businesses paid an average monthly rent of almost $650 million.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




On June 4, at about 1:10 p.m., members of the Red Deer RCMP observed a vehicle displaying a licence plate that did not match the vehicle. Police attempted a traffic stop; however, the vehicle failed to stop and fled at a high rate of speed. Officers did not pursue the vehicle at that time, but later located the same vehicle and initiated a pursuit. The pursuit crossed into a park area, where the subject vehicle was observed driving on sidewalks and walking paths. After officers immobilized the vehicle with a spike belt, the driver, a 28-year-old man, attempted to flee on foot.
As the man attempted to flee, an unmarked RCMP SUV made contact with him, knocking him to the ground. The man quickly got to his feet, continued to flee from police, and jumped into the river. The man was removed from the river with assistance of a police service dog, and apprehended by RCMP officers. Once in custody, it was determined that the man had sustained serious injury to both legs.
ASIRT investigators are asking anyone who was in Michener Bend Park at the time of the incident and observed or recorded video of the events to contact investigators at 403-592-4306.
ASIRT’s investigation will examine the conduct of police during this incident, while the RCMP will maintain responsibility for the investigation into the man and his actions. With ASIRT’s investigation underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

“As we begin Canadian Men’s Health Week, I want to draw attention to some sobering statistics reported by the Canadian Men’s Health Foundation:

more than 80 per cent of men say they are stressed by work and more than 60 per cent lose sleep over it  
49 per cent don’t exercise enough
62 per cent are unhealthy eaters
20 per cent smoke
75 per cent are borderline unhealthy or unhealthy

“The good news is that we can prevent 70 per cent of chronic diseases and conditions by adopting healthy lifestyle habits.
“It’s no coincidence that Men’s Health Week falls in the week leading up to Father’s Day. Men’s health and well-being is important to their children, grandchildren, spouses and everyone who cares about the men in their life.
“As we relaunch our province, Alberta Health Services has begun to resume some screening and lab services that were temporarily reduced or paused in response to COVID-19. FIT testing for colorectal cancer screening is one of those services resuming this week. Colorectal cancer is one of the three most common cancers in males. If you are a man aged 50 to 74, speak with your doctor about whether this screening test is right for you.
“I encourage all men to celebrate this week by making small changes: drink more water, take a break from work, go for a walk and if you smoke, get help to quit.
“If you need help with any aspect of your health and well-being, especially during the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, see your doctor, visit MyHealth.Alberta.ca, and find more tips at menshealthfoundation.ca.”

“Every year, on June 15, we recognize World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. In Alberta and throughout the world, people unite to lift their voices against elder abuse.
“We define elder abuse as any action or inaction, to self or others, that jeopardizes the health or well-being of any older adult. We know rates of abuse of all types, including elder abuse, increase during crises and disasters. There is heightened concern during the COVID?19 pandemic for the potential increase of elder abuse. 
“It is important we mark this day to help reduce the stigma around elder abuse, and remind people that help is available.
“Our government has supported the Alberta Elder Abuse Awareness Council in its mission to support a community response to elder abuse. The council is a provincewide network of professionals dedicated to promoting the well-being and security of older adults by developing resources to address and educate about elder abuse.
“This year, the council launched an awareness campaign that includes a number of tools available at albertaelderabuse.ca. I am proud to present this year’s official declaration to the council today.
“Our government will do everything it can to prevent and end elder abuse, and to ensure the safety and security of Alberta seniors.
""Today, wear purple to show your support for elder abuse prevention, and to recognize World Elder Abuse Awareness Day.""

The Motor Vehicles System (MOVES) that tracks all driver and vehicle information in the province is being updated to continue serving Albertans.

“We appreciate Albertans’ patience while we make this necessary update. I’ve been clear that I want to take Alberta from worst to first when it comes to online registry services and this update will enable us to develop such services including, for example, online driver’s licence renewals.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta

To complete the update, the system must shut down for four days. The system will be unavailable from June 18 at 9 p.m. through June 22. The system will be back in operation by 8 a.m. June 23.
During the shutdown, Albertans will be unable to access all motor vehicle services, including:

Vehicle registrations and renewals
Driver’s licence suspension reinstatements
Driver’s licence and ID card services (including new applications, renewals, temporary licences, exchanges, duplicates and reclassifications)

Albertans whose driver’s licences or ID cards are set to expire on or around these dates should plan to complete their renewals before June 19. Some registry agents are offering services remotely, and Albertans requiring renewal should connect with their local registry agent to explore options for remote renewal ahead of the shutdown.
Albertans with expiring vehicle registrations have until the end of June to renew.
During the shutdown, Albertans can pay outstanding fines online only. Registry agents will be unable to process fine payments during the outage, and traffic courts remain closed to the public due to COVID-19.

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.

Advanced Education will engage stakeholders to co-create an innovative new strategy for Alberta’s universities, colleges, polytechnics and other adult learning providers.
Through the Alberta 2030: Transforming Post-Secondary Education initiative, government will work with a leading research and consulting firm to search for practical solutions that will ensure the adult learning system is affordable, accessible and reflective of our economy's future needs.

“Today is the beginning of an exciting and ambitious project to renew and transform post-secondary education in Alberta. As we move forward with Alberta’s economic recovery, it is essential that we double down on efforts to build a highly skilled and competitive workforce, strengthen the commercialization of research, reduce duplication and forge stronger relationships between employers and post-secondary institutions. We must do everything possible to ensure that when a student graduates from an Alberta post-secondary institution, they are equipped with the skills, knowledge and competencies they need to succeed in a future economy. In short, we must begin to train the workforce of tomorrow, today.”  
Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education


“This announcement marks one of many important milestones for Alberta’s colleges, polytechnics, and universities. Together, Alberta’s post-secondary system offers enriching and diverse learning opportunities as well as cutting-edge research and innovation, all of which strengthen the economic, social and cultural fabric of Alberta. In collaboration with this new partner, we have an important opportunity to enhance the role of our higher education system for all Albertans as we overcome challenges and seize opportunities in building a vibrant and resilient future.”
Dr. Neil Fassina, chair, Council of Post-secondary Presidents of Alberta


""ASEC is excited to learn that the RFP process is completed, and that the post-secondary system review can start in earnest. Alberta's students are engaged, invested, and ready to consult with the government on the development of a modern post-secondary system for Albertans.""
Emmanauel Barker, director, public relations and advocacy, Alberta Students Executive Council

Alberta’s economy is facing many challenges, and post-secondary institutions must be adaptable and forward-thinking. The Alberta 2030 initiative will renew the adult learning system’s focus on providing the education, skills and training the province needs to meet labour market demands and help Albertans get back to work.
Government will collaborate with employers, industry, students, post-secondary institutions and other stakeholders to:

Ensure students have the skills and education to solve emerging problems and adapt to changing demands and opportunities.
Increase access to post-secondary education and encourage a wider range of potential learners to participate.
Increase the level of collaboration between institutions so that students have more options to transfer credit.
Forge stronger relationships between employers and post-secondary institutions to help guide educational programming and work placement opportunities.
Improve governance and financial sustainability for the system, and empower institutions to become more entrepreneurial and seek new sources of revenue.

Quick facts

Stakeholder engagement and consultation will take place in the coming months. Advanced Education has hired a leading research and consulting firm and is in the process of developing a work plan.
The final report is expected in late 2020.
The review will have four main areas of focus:
	
an assessment of global models and trends in post-secondary education
an assessment of Alberta’s existing post-secondary model and governance
an assessment of individual institutions
development of an implementation roadmap by early 2021.

Alberta 2030: Transforming Post-Secondary Education opportunity notice




Le gouvernement examinera le système d'éducation postsecondaire de l'Alberta et élaborera un plan à long terme pour améliorer l'expérience des étudiants et étudiantes, et adapter l'éducation aux besoins en emploi.
Le ministère de l'Enseignement postsecondaire invitera des intervenants à collaborer avec lui afin de créer une nouvelle stratégie novatrice pour les universités, les collèges, les écoles polytechniques et les autres fournisseurs de formation des adultes en Alberta.
Dans le cadre de l'initiative Alberta 2030 : Transforming Post-Secondary Education, le gouvernement travaillera avec un cabinet de recherche et de conseil reconnu afin de trouver des solutions pratiques qui garantiront l’abordabilité et l’accessibilité du système d'apprentissage des adultes, ainsi que sa pertinence en ce qui a trait à nos besoins économiques futurs.

« Nous entreprenons aujourd'hui un projet passionnant et ambitieux qui vise à renouveler et à transformer l'enseignement postsecondaire en Alberta. Alors que nous progressons dans la reprise économique de notre province, il est essentiel que nous redoublions d'efforts pour constituer une main-d'œuvre hautement qualifiée et concurrentielle, pour renforcer la commercialisation de la recherche, pour réduire les chevauchements et pour forger des relations plus solides entre les employeurs et les établissements d'enseignement postsecondaire. Nous devons faire tout notre possible pour nous assurer que lorsqu'un étudiant obtient un diplôme d'un établissement postsecondaire de l'Alberta, il est doté des aptitudes, des connaissances et des compétences nécessaires à sa réussite dans l’économie de l’avenir. En bref, nous devons commencer dès aujourd'hui à former la main-d'œuvre de demain. »
Demetrios Nicolaides, ministre de l'Enseignement postsecondaire


« Cette annonce marque un jalon important parmi de nombreux autres pour les collèges, les écoles polytechniques et les universités de l'Alberta. Le système postsecondaire de l'Alberta offre des possibilités d'apprentissage enrichissantes et diversifiées ainsi que des activités de recherche et d'innovation de pointe, qui renforcent le tissu économique, social et culturel de l'Alberta. En collaboration avec notre nouveau partenaire, nous avons une occasion importante de renforcer le rôle de notre système d'enseignement postsecondaire à l’intention de toute la population albertaine, alors que nous relevons les défis et saisissons les occasions de bâtir un avenir dynamique et résilient. »
Dr. Neil Fassina, président, Council of Post-secondary Presidents of Alberta


« L'ASEC est ravie d'apprendre que le processus de demande de propositions est terminé et que l'examen du système d'enseignement postsecondaire peut maintenant commencer. La population étudiante de l'Alberta est engagée, investie et prête à discuter avec le gouvernement de développement d'un système d'éducation postsecondaire moderne pour les Albertains et les Albertaines. »
Emmanauel Barker, directeur des relations publiques et de la défense des intérêts des étudiants, Alberta Students’ Executive Council  

Avec l'économie de l'Alberta qui fait face à de nombreux défis, les établissements d'enseignement postsecondaire doivent pouvoir s’adapter et être avant-gardistes. Le projet Alberta 2030 renouvèlera l'attention que porte le système d'apprentissage des adultes sur la prestation des services d’éducation, de même que sur les compétences et la formation dont la province a besoin pour répondre aux demandes du marché et aider les Albertains et les Albertaines à retrouver du travail.
Le gouvernement collaborera avec les employeurs, l'industrie, la population étudiante, les établissements d'enseignement postsecondaire et d'autres intervenants pour :

veiller à ce que les étudiants aient les compétences et la formation nécessaires pour pouvoir résoudre les problèmes émergents et s'adapter à des demandes et des possibilités changeantes;
accroître l'accès à l'éducation postsecondaire et encourager un plus grand nombre d'apprenants potentiels à y participer;
accroître le niveau de collaboration entre les établissements afin que les étudiants aient davantage de possibilités de transférer des crédits;
forger des relations plus solides entre les employeurs et les établissements d'enseignement postsecondaire afin de contribuer à orienter les programmes éducatifs et les possibilités de stage professionnel;
améliorer la gouvernance et la viabilité financière du système, et donner aux établissements les moyens de devenir plus entreprenants et de rechercher de nouvelles sources de revenus.

En bref

La mobilisation et la consultation des parties prenantes auront lieu au cours des prochains mois. Le ministère de l’Enseignement postsecondaire a engagé un cabinet de recherche et de conseil reconnu et est en train d'élaborer un plan de travail.
Le rapport final est attendu pour la fin de l'année 2020.
L'examen portera sur les quatre domaines principaux suivants :
	
une évaluation des modèles et des tendances mondiales dans l'enseignement postsecondaire
une évaluation du modèle et de la gouvernance actuels de l'enseignement postsecondaire en Alberta
une évaluation des institutions existantes
l'élaboration d'une feuille de route de mise en œuvre d'ici au début de 2021.

If Bill 22 is passed, most remaining programs and services that have been led by Energy Efficiency Alberta (EEA) will transition to Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) – an organization that has been helping industries and businesses save money and reduce emissions for more than 10 years.
This move will focus the province’s funding on one agency, and make it clearer for applicants and their service providers to access emissions-reduction programs. In addition, a portion of EEA’s funding was derived from the now-repealed consumer carbon tax, which government eliminated in 2019 as part of a platform commitment to Albertans.

“Our government has always maintained that we must leverage our industry partners and small- and medium-sized businesses in order to tackle emissions. We have also committed to streamlining government delivery of services and cutting red tape. By rolling EEA into ERA, we are accomplishing all of the above. We thank the board and staff of EEA for their service, and we look forward to continuing important emissions-reduction work under ERA as we move to a stronger, more diversified economy and put Albertans back to work.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

ERA works with government, industry and innovators to accelerate the development of technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and attract investment. Through ERA, Alberta’s emissions-reduction efforts will focus on the commercial and industrial sectors, which account for more than 65 per cent of the province’s total emissions.

“Reducing costs and emissions are core to ERA’s mandate, and we have a proven business model to offer the organizational efficiencies and results the province is seeking. We will build on EEA’s expertise and experience to help Alberta’s industries achieve sustainable environmental outcomes, attract investment, and improve their overall competitiveness.”
Steve MacDonald, CEO, Emissions Reduction Alberta

Going forward, government will work with ERA on new ideas and solutions for managing and reducing emissions. Decisions on specific programs and administrative details are underway and will be shared with Albertans as updates become available.
EEA will continue to honour pre-existing program commitments, collaborate with applicants, and field inquiries until the agency closes on Sept. 30.
Quick facts

ERA will be supported by the funds generated from the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) system, which regulates emissions from large industries.
Since 2009, Emissions Reduction Alberta has committed more than $534 million to 161 projects that are worth $4 billion. These projects are estimated to reduce emissions by almost 33 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030.

The bill proposes 14 legislative changes across six different ministries. Several of these changes work to promote job creation and support economic growth by removing unnecessary burdens imposed on Albertans and businesses. The remaining changes focus on expediting government approvals, enhancing government transparency, eliminating outdated requirements, and reducing the administrative burden on municipalities.

“Especially now, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to think about ways to make government work better for Albertans. Bill 22 addresses a number of red tape issues, frees up our economy, and will help get Albertans back to work.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction

Highlights of the bill include:

Making it easier and more affordable for non-profits to operate in Alberta.
Improving the efficiency of changes to surface rights agreements.
Reducing trade barriers for grazing leases.
Eliminating unnecessary delays in the oil sands approval process.
Providing more effective and timely online access to statistical government information and reports.


“Alberta is open for business and that includes supporting non-profits that do such important work in our communities. I’m happy to see these red tape reduction items coming forward to make life easier and more attractive for businesses and non-profits in our province.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta


""The Law Society of Alberta wishes to gratefully acknowledge the assistance and cooperation of the Alberta government in the introduction of proposed amendments to the Business Corporations Act to eliminate certain resident Canadian director requirements. We expect this to have a positive impact on the business environment in Alberta.""
Cal Johnson, bencher, Law Society of Alberta


“The oil and natural gas industry continuously strives to improve performance and efficiency and we are happy to see the province of Alberta committed to this goal as well through red tape reduction. Streamlining project applications and approval timelines will support industry’s recovery and job creation efforts, while providing greater certainty to attract investment back to the sector. These efficiencies can be achieved while still maintaining the highest level of environmental and safety standards that Albertans expect.”
Tim McMillan, president and CEO, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers

Full details of Bill 22 are available online.
The introduction of this bill is another positive step forward in government’s commitment to reduce red tape and make life easier for all Albertans. To track red tape reduction progress and submit suggestions about where government can cut even more red tape, please visit CutRedTape.Alberta.ca.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The Respect in School training program is being expanded to day care and day camp workers. The training offered through Respect Group has been provided to school leaders – including teachers, educational assistants, custodians and bus drivers – across Alberta and is designed to give individuals who work with children the tools to identify and address bullying, abuse, harassment and discrimination.

“Early childhood educators and day camp professionals work very closely with the children and families in their programs every day and are uniquely positioned to play a role in keeping children safe. This training will help further their skills in recognizing and responding to issues of maltreatment which will further keep children safe.”
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services


“Giving school leaders more tools in their tool box to support our students benefits all of society, and I’m proud to be able to do so as Minister of Education. Our collective efforts to stop bullying and harassment online, in our homes, in our workplaces and in our schools must be a priority. We all have a role to play, and we must do all we can to support and protect our children.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education


“This program reflects our government’s commitment towards building strong, resilient communities that support and protect each other in difficult times. By working with professionals in child care and day camps, we can give them the tools they need to help end the cycle of violence and keep kids safe.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women


“These are stressful and anxious times for our kids and those who interact with them each day. Proactive education to deal with these realities is key and I applaud Minister Schulz, Minister LaGrange and Minister Aheer for their collaborative leadership. I am proud to live in a province where child protection and psychological safety is a top priority.”  
Sheldon Kennedy, co-founder, Respect Group


“Foothills School Division was the first school jurisdiction in Alberta to require Respect in School certification. This training supports our responsibility of creating, maintaining and promoting a welcoming, caring, respectful and safe learning environment. Over 96 per cent of our certified users felt the program made them a ‘more child-centered leader’ which, to me, says it all!”
Allen Davidson, assistant superintendent, Employee Services, Foothills School Division

While children currently remain unable to attend school due to the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying domestic abuse may be more challenging to determine. By taking this training, professionals who work with children will gain skills to better understand, prevent and respond to incidents, as well as to proactively build safe and nurturing environments for children to thrive, both at home and in the community. While early childhood educators do take some courses in this area – such as trauma-informed care and non-violent crisis intervention training – this course offers an opportunity to refresh and tailor their skills to the challenges they may encounter today.
Quick facts

There are more than 18,000 certified staff working in Alberta’s licensed child care programs.
Child care staff are encouraged but not obligated to take the training, which will be funded by government.
More than 5,000 school leaders have already taken the program and tens of thousands more are eligible.
There are about 20,000 day care staff and 5,000 day camp workers eligible to take this training.

Red Deer will have one of five drug treatment courts outside of Edmonton and Calgary as part of government’s four-year investment of up to $20 million toward expanding the program across the province.
The government is also providing Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams (ALERT) with a $50-million budget increase for initiatives to disrupt and dismantle organized crime. A portion of this new funding will allow ALERT to expand regional organized crime units across the province, including the addition of three new investigators to the regional unit based in Red Deer.

“Our government will be opening a drug treatment court in Red Deer to reduce crime by offering treatment to those struggling with addiction to help get their lives back on track. We are also ensuring law enforcement in central Alberta have the resources they need to disrupt and dismantle the organized crime groups that traffic and supply the illegal drugs that fuel addiction and take a terrible toll on our communities.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


“Our government has made several important investments in mental health and addiction services across the province over the last year to ensure all Albertans have access to the supports they need to get on the road to recovery. This announcement is no exception. Drug treatment courts are an important way to help Albertans on the road to recovery. We are committed to ensuring people everywhere, including in Red Deer, get the support they need now and in the future.”
Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions


“I am pleased that our government has chosen Red Deer as one of the locations for five new drug treatment courts in Alberta. This provides a new avenue for Albertans struggling with substance abuse in central Alberta. I look forward to seeing the positive impact it has on its participants, their families, and our broader community.”
Adriana LaGrange, MLA for Red Deer-North


“The City of Red Deer welcomes news that the Government of Alberta has selected our city for a drug treatment court. With the significant public safety and health issues our community and region are facing, this will help to break the systemic cycle of addiction and crime as a much-needed alternative legal mechanism, as well as alleviate backlog pressures currently facing our justice system locally. Additional capacity in the local justice system will also help support the interests of victims of crime.”
Tara Veer, mayor, City of Red Deer

Expanding drug treatment courts
Drug treatment courts help break the cycle of crime motivated by addiction by giving people who commit non-violent offences access to judicially supervised treatment and recovery. Treatment is supplemented by frequent drug testing, incentives, sanctions and social services support.

“A drug treatment court in Red Deer will be an integral part of a positive, fundamental course correction in the public interest, providing opportunities for us to support individuals choosing to forsake crime, make restitution, and seek freedom from addictions, while respecting businesses and families in our wonderful community. Better days are ahead.”
Jason Stephan, MLA for Red Deer-South


""Rehabilitation of offenders is part of the sentencing regime courts must follow. Those people who are motivated to commit offences because of their addiction to drugs are often most in need of rehabilitation. A drug treatment court serving Red Deer and surrounding areas will assist the court in meeting this objective and we very much look forward to this addition to the court in central Alberta.”
Assistant Chief Judge James A. Hunter


“Drug treatment court is the reason I am alive today. I was facing four years in jail for trafficking methamphetamine in Camrose and was so sick and deep into my addiction that my life was falling apart. My children and I were near death. Today, I am proud to say that I continue my life in recovery and advocate for others who struggle with addictions and mental health.”
Pamela Spurvey, 2007 graduate, Edmonton Drug Treatment Court


“Drug treatment court was an integral part of my recovery journey. Like many, I caused a tremendous amount of harm while in active addiction. Without this program, I might not be alive today and I certainly wouldn’t be living a quality life in recovery. I am grateful for this government’s continued expansion of this program so others get the same opportunity for recovery that it gave me.”
Sheldon Bailey, participant, Drug Treatment Court


“Parents Empowering Parents (PEP) has built a strong partnership with the drug treatment court program over the years. This innovative program and the partnership we’ve built has meant that participants and their families are supported through their long-term recovery. We are excited to hear about the expansion of this program across the province and look forward to seeing its positive impacts.”
Lerena Greig, executive director, Parents Empowering Parents (PEP) Society


“The announcement of the Red Deer Drug Treatment Court is an indication of the innovative and progressive work that Minister Schweitzer has undertaken to combat rural crime in Alberta. Drug treatment courts have proven success in creating the opportunity to change the lives of those who are caught in this cycle of addiction and crime.”
Grace Froese, director, Provincial Drug Court Expansion and Development, Edmonton John Howard Society

New funding will be used to establish drug treatment courts in five locations outside of Calgary and Edmonton. The court in Red Deer, along with a new program in Lethbridge announced earlier this year, is expected to be operational by late 2021. Three additional sites have yet to be determined.
Drug treatment courts have been operating in Edmonton since 2005 and Calgary since 2007, and part of the $20 million in additional funding is also being used to double the total combined capacity of the two existing courts to about 80 participants a year.
Expanding ALERT
As part of a build-up of regional organized crime units around the province, ALERT is adding three positions to an existing team of 15 investigators based in Red Deer.

“The added resources, and enhancement of our ALERT team in Red Deer, will create more opportunities for collaboration, intelligence sharing, and provide a more versatile response to serious and organized crime in the central Alberta region.”
Supt. Dwayne Lakusta, chief executive officer, ALERT

This move will expand ALERT’s geographic reach in rural areas. It also creates opportunities for investigators from smaller law enforcement agencies to gain experience working on complex cases, which they take back to their respective organizations.

Public health guidances must be followed.
Stage three depends on success in stage two. Factors are: active cases, infection rates, health-care system capacity, cases in hospital and intensive care.
For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.

Getting ready for 2020-21 school year

A comprehensive re-entry plan for the upcoming school year allows schools and parents to prepare for learning while putting students and staff safety first.
The plan offers guidance on a wide range of operational issues including hygiene and health requirements, student learning, transportation and diploma exams. It also addresses mental health and psychological supports for students and staff.
For more information, read the news release.

Relaxing the 30-day limit for prescription drugs

As of June 15, pharmacists can begin to give out larger quantities again, up to a 100-day supply.
Pharmacists should use their professional judgment and dispense a 30-day supply when necessary for specific drugs that still have shortages or supply chain issues.
Government, industry, pharmacy organizations, and other health sector partners continue to monitor supply levels. If there is evidence that there isn’t enough supply, or that drugs are being stockpiled, government could re-introduce limits.

Free non-medical masks

Albertans can get four free non-medical masks per person at any Alberta A&W, McDonald’s Canada and Tim Hortons drive-thru while supplies last, no purchase necessary.
Masks are at drive-thrus only. Those who can’t get to a drive-thru can check other options here.

Supporting Alberta businesses through relaunch

The Alberta Biz Connect web page has health and safety guidelines for general workplaces, and sector-specific guidelines. As we near the next stage of relaunch, businesses are encouraged to continue to check for new and updated guidance documents.


A template on the Biz Connect website can help businesses plan how to protect employees and patrons from infection. Completing the template is voluntary.

The plan offers guidance on a wide range of operational issues including hygiene and health requirements, student learning, transportation and diploma exams. It also addresses mental health and psychological supports for students and staff.
School authorities will plan for all three scenarios for September:

In-school classes resume (near normal operations with health measures)
In-school classes partially resume with additional health measures
At home learning continues (in-school classes are cancelled)

The preferred and likely scenario is that students will return to daily in-school classes at the beginning of the year. The government will share its final decision by Aug. 1 on which scenario will be in place at the beginning of the school year. However, school authorities are asked to prepare for implementing any of the three possibilities during the upcoming school year, including on short notice.

“We are providing clear direction and the certainty parents and the school system need to plan ahead and get ready for what the new school year may look like. We are hoping, and it is likely, students can return to daily classes at school while taking health precautions, but we have to prepare for all possibilities. I want to thank our education leaders, teachers and parents for their thoughtful contributions to this comprehensive plan.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education


“This plan puts the interests of students and staff first. Educators, administrators, families, health professionals and government all need to work together to support a safe return to in-person classes. We continue to monitor the situation closely. The reality is, we must weigh the risk of prolonged school closures against the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in closed settings, such as schools. A safe and successful school year will only be possible if we all work together.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health

The re-entry plan balances the need for provincial standardized approaches in some areas while also providing flexibility and recognition of school authorities’ autonomy to address health guidelines in the most effective ways in their own communities.
Alberta Education worked closely with many education partners on the plan, including the Alberta School Boards Association, the Alberta Teachers’ Association, the College of Alberta School Superintendents, the Association of Independent Schools and Colleges in Alberta, The Association of Alberta Public Charter Schools, individual school authorities and the Alberta School Councils’ Association which compiled input from more than 66,000 parents.

“The Alberta School Councils’ Association is pleased that considerations for the safety of students and staff remain priorities throughout this detailed plan, along with the recognition that school authorities are best suited to making operational decisions directly impacting their local school communities. We look forward to ongoing work and communications with the ministry, as this is key for successful implementation and return to school.”
Brandi Rai, president, Alberta School Councils’ Association


“Alberta’s teachers are looking forward to supporting our students as we transition into the 2020-21 school year. As our recent survey indicates, teachers are concerned about the health and safety of themselves, their colleagues and their students. We expect to work with government to strengthen and improve the plans for re-entry to ensure that schools can provide healthy and safe environments for teachers and students.”
Jason Schilling, president, Alberta Teachers’ Association


“Supporting the health and safety of students and staff continues to be a top priority for the ASBA and all school boards. We appreciate government providing clarity, while ensuring flexibility and autonomy, as each of Alberta’s public, Catholic and Francophone boards face challenges within the context of their local communities. As the situation evolves, we will continue to collaborate with government and our members to adjust the plan in preparation for the upcoming school year.”
Lorrie Jess, president, Alberta School Boards Association


“The College of Alberta School Superintendents joins the province in its commitment to protecting the health and well-being of all students and staff as we transition to the 2020-21 school year. We appreciate the collaborative manner in which the re-entry plan has developed and are pleased that school divisions have been provided with the flexibility and authority to implement procedures beyond the plan that they deem necessary to ensure the safety of their learning environments.”
Bevan Daverne, president, College of Alberta School Superintendents


“We are deeply appreciative of the ongoing consultation with all educational partners by the Minister of Education and the ministry as a whole in these trying circumstances. Teachers and systems have responded to the pandemic with remarkable energy and ingenuity. The proactive, engaging leadership of our government continues to be essential for education to fulfil its vital role in Alberta through this critical time.”
Ron Koper, chair, The Association of Alberta Public Charter Schools


“Our association appreciates the government’s collaborative approach in developing this re-entry plan. We remain committed to supporting our schools so that their staff and students can experience a safe and positive learning environment in the coming academic year.”
Simon Williams, president, Association of Independent Schools and Colleges in Alberta

Public health guidance for schools
Return to in-school class learning may vary across the province and is dependent on the number of COVID-19 cases in the local area. School boards should develop their own COVID-19 plans under the applicable scenario and health guidelines prior to reopening.
Measures to reduce the risk – scenario 1 (in-school classes resume – near normal operations with health measures)
Cleaning

Enhanced cleaning and disinfecting, including daily cleaning for all areas of the school, washrooms and high-touch surfaces cleaned several times a day or more as needed.
Regularly scheduled deep cleaning when students are not present.

Student/staff hygiene and illness

Routine screening for all staff and students.
Strict stay-at-home policy for any students or staff exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.
Hand hygiene expectations when entering and exiting the school and classrooms, before and after eating.
Continual reminders of the importance of respiratory etiquette (e.g., cover coughs and sneezes, avoid touching the face and disposal of used tissues promptly, followed by hand hygiene).
Students who develop symptoms at school may be asked to wear a mask and isolate in a separate room until a parent arrives for pickup. If a separate room is not available, the student must be kept at least two metres away from other individuals.

Physical distancing and grouping

When possible, practise some physical distancing as a good precaution to prevent the spread of disease.
In classrooms, buses and during activities when physical distancing may not be possible, extra emphasis is put on other hygiene practices.
Reorganization of rooms to allow for more physical space.
Cohorting of students by class where possible.
Guiding foot traffic flow through entrances and hallways by using markers on the floor or pylons/barriers.
Avoiding large gatherings such as assemblies.

Masks

Staff and students will not be mandated to wear masks.
Masks may be considered in circumstances where there is prolonged close contact (greater than 15 minutes) and distance of two metres cannot be maintained.
Masking is generally not recommended for younger students.

Shared items

A no-sharing policy – all students should have their own supplies.
Where sharing of equipment is required, the equipment should be cleaned between uses.

Cases of COVID-19 in a school

The zone medical officer of health will work with school authorities on the rapid identification of cases through easily accessible testing, rapid close contact identification, and isolation measures when needed.
The zone medical officer of health will also work with school authorities to provide follow-up recommendations and messaging for staff, parents and students.
Alberta Health Services may request the school to close in-person classes to allow the public health investigation to take place.
Each school authority will support students and staff to learn or work at home if they are required to self-isolate.

Measures to reduce the risk – scenario 2 (in-school classes partially resume with additional health measures)
The same considerations as scenario 1, with the following differences:

A recommended maximum of 15 people in a classroom to allow for more consistent physical distancing.
Students will attend school less regularly as school authorities will need to adjust their class schedule and configuration to meet the physical distancing requirement.

Non-COVID-19 operational highlights

Any summer programming will follow scenario 2 of the re-entry plan and the associated public health measures.
August diploma exams will proceed for students taking diploma courses this summer.
For the 2020-21 school year, diploma exams will be held if the first or second scenarios are in place. In scenario 3, exams may be cancelled.
Provincial achievement tests (PATs) for Grades 6 and 9 can be held in the first and second scenarios, but will be optional for school authorities to participate.
If scenario 3 is in place at the beginning of the school year, the January PATs will be cancelled. May/June PATs may be cancelled based on the duration of at-home learning.


School authorities can, as deemed appropriate at the local level, reduce time spent teaching non-core subjects to allow for additional instruction time on core subjects.
School authorities must enable the full participation and inclusion of students with disabilities under each scenario and address any learning gaps from the 2019-20 school year.
Mental health supports should be in place for students and staff.

This plan is part Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely begin removing public health restrictions and reopen our economy. For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.

Un plan de retour en classe détaillé pour la prochaine année scolaire permet aux écoles et aux parents de se préparer à l’apprentissage tout en accordant la priorité à la sécurité des élèves et du personnel.
Le plan offre des recommandations sur un vaste éventail de questions opérationnelles, notamment les exigences en matière d’hygiène et de santé, l’apprentissage des élèves, le transport et les examens sanctionnés par un diplôme. Il traite également de la santé mentale et du soutien psychologique offert aux élèves et au personnel.
Les administrations scolaires planifieront la mise en œuvre des trois scénarios suivants pour septembre :

Retour à l’apprentissage en classe (fonctionnement presque normal, avec des mesures sanitaires)
Retour partiel à l’apprentissage en classe (avec des mesures sanitaires supplémentaires)
Poursuite de l’apprentissage à la maison (les cours dans les écoles sont annulés)

Le scénario souhaité et probable prévoit que tous les élèves reprendront un apprentissage quotidien en classe au début de l’année scolaire. Le gouvernement rendra sa décision sur le sujet d’ici au 1er août. Cependant, les administrations scolaires doivent se préparer de façon à pouvoir mettre en œuvre chacune des trois possibilités au cours de la prochaine année scolaire, y compris à court préavis.

« Nous offrons une orientation claire et les garanties dont les parents et le système scolaire ont besoin pour organiser la nouvelle année scolaire et s’y préparer. Nous espérons que les élèves pourront se rendre à l’école tous les jours (ce qui est probable) en prenant des précautions sanitaires, mais nous devons nous préparer à toutes les possibilités. Je tiens à remercier nos responsables de l’éducation, le personnel enseignant et les parents de leurs contributions constructives à ce plan détaillé. »
Adriana LaGrange, ministre de l’Éducation


« Ce plan a été conçu pour voir d’abord aux intérêts des élèves et du personnel. Les éducateurs, les administrateurs, les familles, les professionnels de la santé et le gouvernement doivent tous travailler ensemble pour favoriser un retour en classe en personne en toute sécurité. Nous continuons de suivre de près l’évolution de la situation. La réalité est telle que nous devons évaluer le risque associé à une fermeture prolongée des écoles par rapport au risque d’éclosions de COVID-19 dans des environnements fermés, comme les écoles. Une année scolaire sûre et fructueuse ne sera possible que si nous travaillons tous ensemble. »
Dre Deena Hinshaw, médecin-hygiéniste en chef

Ce plan reconnaît la nécessité d’une orientation provinciale et d’approches normalisées dans certains domaines, mais il donne également aux administrations scolaires une certaine flexibilité en plus de l’autonomie d’appliquer des lignes directrices en matière de santé de la manière la plus efficace dans leurs propres collectivités.
Le ministère de l’Éducation de l’Alberta a travaillé en étroite collaboration avec de nombreux partenaires de l’éducation à l’élaboration de ce plan, notamment l’Alberta School Boards Association (association des conseils scolaires de l’Alberta), l’Alberta Teachers’ Association (association des enseignements de l’Alberta), le College of Alberta School Superintendents (collège des directeurs scolaires de l’Alberta), l’Association of Independent Schools and Colleges in Alberta (association des écoles et collèges indépendants de l’Alberta), l’Association of Alberta Public Charter Schools (association des écoles à charte publiques de l’Alberta), les administrations scolaires individuelles et l’Alberta School Councils’ Association (association des comités d’école de l’Alberta), qui ont compilé les commentaires de plus de 66 000 parents.

« L’Alberta School Councils’ Association se réjouit du fait que les considérations relatives à la sécurité des élèves et du personnel demeurent une priorité dans le plan détaillé, et que celui-ci reconnaît également que les administrations scolaires sont les mieux placées pour prendre des décisions opérationnelles ayant une incidence directe sur leurs communautés scolaires locales. Nous attendons avec impatience de pouvoir travailler et établir une communication continue avec le Ministère, car c’est la clé d’une mise en œuvre et d’un retour à l’école réussis. »
Brandi Rai, présidente, Alberta School Councils’ Association


« Le personnel enseignant de l’Alberta est impatient de pouvoir soutenir ses élèves dès le début de l’année scolaire 2020-2021. D’après notre récent sondage, les membres du personnel enseignant s’inquiètent de leurs propres santé et sécurité, mais aussi de celles de leurs collègues et de leurs élèves. Nous prévoyons travailler avec le gouvernement pour renforcer et améliorer les plans de retour à l’école afin de nous assurer que les écoles puissent offrir des environnements sains et sécuritaires au personnel enseignant et aux élèves. »
Jason Schilling, président, Alberta Teachers’ Association


« Le soutien des élèves et du personnel en matière de santé et de sécurité continue d’être une priorité absolue pour l’Alberta School Board Association et tous les conseils scolaires. Nous sommes reconnaissants au gouvernement des directives claires fournies aux conseils publics, catholiques et francophones de l’Alberta tout comme de la flexibilité et de l’autonomie accordées, car chacun fait face à des défis propres au contexte de sa communauté locale. À mesure que la situation évolue, nous continuerons de collaborer avec le gouvernement et avec nos membres pour ajuster le plan en prévision de la prochaine année scolaire. »
Lorrie Jess, présidente, Alberta School Boards Association


« Le College of Alberta School Superintendents joint ses efforts à ceux de la province dans son engagement à protéger la santé et le bien-être de tous les élèves et membres du personnel alors que nous nous préparons à l’année scolaire 2020-2021. Nous sommes ravis de la collaboration sollicitée lors de l’élaboration du plan de retour en classe, et nous sommes heureux que les divisions scolaires se soient vu accorder la souplesse et le pouvoir nécessaires pour mettre en œuvre les procédures qu’elles jugent nécessaires en dehors du plan pour assurer la sécurité de leurs environnements d’apprentissage. »
Bevan Daverne, président, College of Alberta School Superintendents


« Nous sommes profondément reconnaissants de la consultation en cours tenue par la ministre de l’Éducation et le Ministère dans son ensemble avec tous les partenaires de l’éducation dans ces circonstances difficiles. Le personnel enseignant et les systèmes ont réagi à la pandémie avec une énergie et une ingéniosité remarquables. Le leadeurship proactif et motivant de notre gouvernement demeure essentiel au rôle vital de l’éducation en Alberta durant cette période difficile. »
Ron Koper, président, The Association of Alberta Public Charter Schools


« Notre association est reconnaissante de l’approche collaborative du gouvernement dans l’élaboration de ce plan de retour à l’école. Nous restons déterminés à soutenir nos écoles afin que leur personnel et leurs élèves puissent profiter d’un environnement d’apprentissage sécuritaire et positif au cours de la prochaine année scolaire. »
Simon Williams, président, Association of Independent Schools and Colleges in Alberta

Recommandations liées à la santé publique dans les écoles
Le retour à l’apprentissage en classe peut varier dans la province, selon le nombre de cas de COVID-19 dans chaque région. Avant de rouvrir les établissements scolaires, les conseils scolaires devraient élaborer leurs propres plans relatifs à la COVID-19 selon le scénario et les lignes directrices applicables en matière de santé.
Mesures de réduction des risques – Scénario 1 (Retour à l’apprentissage en classe (fonctionnement presque normal, avec des mesures sanitaires)
Nettoyage

Nettoyage et désinfection accrus, y compris le nettoyage quotidien de l’ensemble des zones de l’école, et nettoyage des toilettes et des surfaces souvent touchées à de multiples reprises dans la journée, ou augmentation de la fréquence au besoin.
Nettoyage en profondeur prévu régulièrement en l’absence des élèves.

Hygiène des élèves et du personnel et maladie

Évaluation systématique de l’ensemble du personnel et des élèves.
Politique stricte exigeant que tout élève ou membre du personnel présentant des symptômes de la COVID-19 reste à la maison.
Attentes en matière d’hygiène des mains à l’entrée et à la sortie de l’école et des salles de classe, ainsi qu’avant et après les repas.
Rappels continus de l’importance de l’étiquette respiratoire (p. ex. se couvrir la bouche pour tousser et éternuer, éviter de se toucher le visage et jeter rapidement les mouchoirs usagés, puis se laver les mains).
Possibilité de demander aux élèves qui développent des symptômes à l’école de porter un masque et de s’isoler dans une pièce séparée jusqu’à ce qu’un parent vienne les chercher. Si aucune pièce séparée ne peut être utilisée, l’élève doit être tenu à au moins deux mètres des autres enfants.

Éloignement physique et regroupement

Respect d’un certain éloignement physique à titre préventif pour éviter la propagation de la maladie, dans la mesure du possible.
Dans les salles de classe, dans les autobus et pendant les activités où l’éloignement physique n’est pas possible, mise en pratique accrue d’autres pratiques d’hygiène.
Réorganisation des salles pour accroître l’espace physique disponible.
Regroupement en cohortes des élèves par classe, dans la mesure du possible.
Orientation des élèves dans les entrées et les couloirs au moyen de marqueurs au plancher ou encore de poteaux ou de barrières.
Annulation, si possible, des grands rassemblements tels que les assemblées.

Masques

Le personnel et les élèves ne seront pas tenus de porter des masques.
Le port du masque peut être envisagé en cas de contact étroit prolongé (plus de 15 minutes) et qu’une distance de deux mètres ne peut pas être maintenue.
Le port du masque n’est généralement pas recommandé pour les élèves plus jeunes.

Éléments échangés

Politique d’interdiction d’échanges – tous les élèves doivent avoir leurs propres fournitures scolaires.
Nettoyage entre chaque utilisation de tout matériel devant faire l’objet d’une utilisation commune.

Cas de COVID-19 dans une école

Le médecin-hygiéniste de la région travaillera avec les administrations scolaires pour repérer rapidement les cas de COVID-19 grâce à un dépistage facilement réalisable, à la recherche des contacts étroits et à des mesures d’isolement, au besoin.
Le médecin-hygiéniste de la région collaborera également avec les administrations scolaires pour transmettre des recommandations et des messages de suivi au personnel, aux parents et aux élèves.
L’Alberta Health Services (services de santé de l’Alberta) pourrait demander à l’école de mettre un terme aux classes en personne pour permettre la tenue d’une enquête de santé publique.
Chaque administration scolaire aidera les élèves et le personnel dans l’apprentissage ou le travail à la maison s’ils doivent s’isoler.

Mesures pour réduire le risque – Scénario 2 (retour partiel à l’apprentissage en classe avec des mesures sanitaires supplémentaires)
Les mêmes considérations que celles du scénario 1 s’appliquent, avec les différences suivantes :

On recommande un maximum de 15 élèves dans une classe pour permettre un éloignement physique plus constant.
Les élèves iront à l’école moins fréquemment, car les administrations scolaires devront adapter leur horaire et leur configuration pour répondre aux exigences en matière d’éloignement physique.

Points saillants opérationnels non associés à la COVID-19

Tout programme d’été sera offert conformément au scénario 2 du plan de retour et aux mesures de santé publique connexes.
Les examens sanctionnés par un diplôme tenus en août auront lieu pour les élèves qui suivront des cours sanctionnés par un diplôme cet été.
Pour l’année scolaire 2020-2021, des examens sanctionnés par un diplôme seront tenus si le premier ou le deuxième scénario est suivi. Si le scénario 3 est mis en œuvre, les examens pourraient être annulés.
Les tests de rendement provinciaux de 6e et de 9e année peuvent être tenus si le scénario 1 ou 2 est mis en œuvre, mais la participation des administrations scolaires sera facultative.
Si le scénario 3 est mis en œuvre au début de l’année scolaire, les tests de rendement provinciaux du mois de janvier seront annulés. Les tests de rendement provinciaux des mois de mai et de juin pourraient être annulés en fonction de la durée de la période d’apprentissage à la maison.


Les administrations scolaires peuvent, si elles le jugent approprié au niveau local, réduire le temps consacré à l’enseignement des matières non essentielles pour accorder du temps d’enseignement supplémentaire aux matières essentielles.
Pour chaque scénario, les administrations scolaires doivent permettre la participation et l’intégration entières des élèves en situation de handicap et combler toute lacune d’apprentissage de l’année scolaire 2019-2020.
Un soutien en santé mentale doit être mis en place pour les élèves et le personnel.

Ce plan fait partie de la Stratégie de relance de l’Alberta, qui vise une élimination progressive des restrictions de santé publique et une relance de notre économie en toute sécurité. Pour obtenir de plus amples renseignements, veuillez consulter alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy (en anglais seulement).

HONOURABLE MR. SCHWEITZER




177/2020


PROVINCIAL COURT ACT (sections 9.1 and 9.11) - Effective August 1, 2020, designates Derek Gordon Redman as Chief Judge of The Provincial Court of Alberta.





Orders in Council can now be viewed on the Queen's Printer website at: http://www.qp.alberta.ca/507.cfm

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




As of June 15, pharmacists in Alberta can begin to give out larger quantities again, up to a 100-day supply.
To handle the critical drug supply issues that affected Alberta and the world due to COVID-19, government recommended pharmacists dispense a maximum 30-day supply of prescription drugs, when appropriate. This made sure pharmacies could supply people with the prescriptions they needed. Because of this temporary measure and the evolving COVID-19 situation, conditions have improved.

“Pharmacists continue to work tirelessly on the front lines, and we thank them for their efforts. We are confident that now is the time to adjust our guidance to help Albertans make fewer visits to pharmacies and to support pharmacists in reducing the volume of prescriptions to fill.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The Alberta College of Pharmacy and the Alberta Pharmacists’ Association support this recommendation and encourage pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to begin to fill prescriptions as they normally would.

“The temporary 30-day medication supply recommendation has certainly helped to stabilize the majority of the drug supply chain. While we understand that some medication shortages continue to exist for certain medications, we are confident that pharmacists will be able to transition patients back to receiving three-month supplies for the majority of their medications where appropriate.”
Margaret Wing, CEO, Alberta Pharmacists’ Association


“Drug shortages are an increasing problem for Canadians, and in some cases, COVID has made this worse. Therefore, as Alberta Health relaxes this policy, pharmacists should use their professional judgment to limit the dispensed quantities of specific drugs that continue to be short, and continue their commitment to appropriate drug therapy. We will continue to work with Alberta Health and other provincial and national partners to monitor drug shortages.”
Greg Eberhart, registrar, Alberta College of Pharmacy

While supply levels appear to be returning to normal, some drugs are still in limited supply. Pharmacists should use their professional judgment and dispense a 30-day supply when necessary for specific drugs that continue to have shortages or supply chain issues. Pharmacists can use the drug shortage list posted on the Alberta Blue Cross website as a reference. If a medication dispensed is on the list, government-sponsored drug plan members will pay the maximum copayment of $8.
Government, industry, pharmacy organizations, and other health sector partners continue to monitor supply levels. If there is evidence that there isn’t enough supply, or that drugs are being stockpiled, government could re-introduce limits.
Quick facts  

Pharmacists in Alberta can begin to dispense larger quantities again, up to a 100-day supply, starting on June 15.
While supply levels may be stabilizing, supply pressures continue for certain drugs. Pharmacists are advised to use their judgment and dispense a maximum 30-day supply of drugs that are affected by shortages or supply chain issues.
For government-sponsored drug plan members, drugs unaffected by shortages or supply chain issues will be dispensed at the usual rates and rules. This means that government-sponsored drug plan members will pay the normal maximum $25 copayment.
Drugs that have shortages or supply chain issues can be subject to a discretionary 30-day supply limit. Government-sponsored drug plan members will continue to pay a maximum copayment of $8 for these drugs.
To find out if a specific drug is affected by a shortage or supply chain issue, people are encouraged to ask their pharmacist when they have their prescriptions filled.
Albertans can access information on specific drug shortages at the Drug Shortages Canada website, where companies are required to report all actual and anticipated shortages within specific time frames. Health Canada has also published a list of critical drugs that are in high demand or in shortage. A list will also be available for pharmacies on the Alberta Blue Cross website.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The man, a member and chief of the Athabasca Fort Chipewyan First Nation, was with his wife and another family member at the time of the incident.
This case provides an opportunity to clarify how ASIRT becomes involved in an investigation. ASIRT, a civilian-led, independent investigative body, was formed in 2008 to fulfil the role of the “integrated investigative unit” that had been developed and defined in the Police Act. The scope of ASIRT’s mandate is limited by the Police Act. Unlike similar units in other jurisdictions, ASIRT does not choose which matters it will investigate. Instead, when an incident occurs where the serious injury or death of a person may have been the result of police conduct, or where there has been a serious or sensitive allegation of police misconduct, the involved police service must notify the director of law enforcement (DLE), who must then decide how the matter should proceed. Of the available choices, the DLE has the option to involve ASIRT. ASIRT is assigned its investigations at the direction of the DLE.
In the current case, as a result of a conversation between the RCMP and the DLE on June 6, the determination was made that the incident fell under the relevant provisions of the Police Act and that ASIRT would be directed to investigate. To be clear: prior to June 6, ASIRT had no involvement in the matter in any capacity.
With ASIRT’s investigation now underway, there will be no further comment on this matter until the matter has been concluded.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

The service would run between Calgary International Airport and Banff, with potential stops in between.

“Our government is creating an environment where investors and job creators can succeed in Alberta. We are pleased to be partnering with the CIB to complete a feasibility study for the Calgary-Banff Rail project. The CIB brings expertise and experience that is needed for a project of this scale. We look forward to learning more about this exciting project and hearing from our community partners about how this opportunity can support our tourism industry and get our economy back on track.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation


“We are pleased to be building a strong partnership with the Government of Alberta. An important part of the CIB’s role is to work closely with governments across Canada to advance new infrastructure opportunities. The Calgary-Banff Rail project is the first of many potential projects for the CIB in Alberta.”
Michael Sabia, board chair, Canada Infrastructure Bank


“We were elected with a platform commitment to double the size of our tourism industry, and this type of project is the type of bold and innovative strategic thinking that we need to consider if we want to properly show off Alberta’s majestic landscapes and scenery. We know that Alberta’s tourism industry is world-class, and we will build it to new heights.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism


“I have been a huge advocate for this project within our government since being elected last spring. The potential for a beautiful passenger rail service running through the Rocky Mountains poses a tremendous opportunity to attract international visitors and grow our tourism economy here in Alberta and is an opportunity I am extremely excited about. At a time in our history when many tourism economies have been effectively devastated by COVID-19 travel restrictions, I believe there is no better time to consider this strategic investment in our tourism industry and give hope to our industry operators than right now. Today’s announcement serves as a vote of confidence from our government that we support Alberta’s world-class tourism industry and are committed to helping it grow to its full potential over the course of our governance.”
Miranda Rosin, MLA, for Banff-Kananaskis

The cost of the feasibility study will be paid for by the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Quick facts

In 2017, Alberta saw:
	
$8.9 billion in tourism expenditures – an increase of
		five per cent from the previous year
36.9 million person-visits – an increase of 6.1 per cent from the previous year


Banff is an important tourism destination in Alberta. Banff National Park attracts about four million visitors a year.
About 23,000 vehicles travel Highway 1 in both directions at the Banff National Park gates every day.
The growing number of visitors to the area is increasing traffic congestion on highways and local roads.
The CIB uses federal funding to attract private sector and institutional investment into revenue-generating projects that are in the public interest. 
Government is building a bold 10-year tourism strategy to double tourism spending in our province to $20 billion by 2030.

Judge Redman has been appointed for a seven-year term. Judge Terry Matchett, who has served as chief judge since 2013, will continue to serve as a judge of the provincial court.

“My most heartfelt congratulations to Judge Redman on his appointment. As an experienced jurist, he has served Albertans well, and I am confident Judge Redman will provide expert leadership as the courts navigate the way forward in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General

Judge Redman graduated from Queen’s University in Kingston, Ont., in 1981, and then articled and practised with Cook, Snowdon and Laird in Calgary. He moved to Lethbridge in 1984, where he practised with Davidson & Williams. Judge Redman was appointed Queen’s counsel in 2000, was appointed a provincial court judge in 2007 and assistant chief judge in 2017.

“I want to thank Chief Judge Matchett for his service during his term as chief judge. His guidance and leadership of the courts during the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic has been exceptional. We wish him continued success as he continues to serve as a judge in Alberta’s provincial court.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General

The chief judge’s role in Alberta’s provincial court is to effectively manage the court in the interest of the public while ensuring the efficient administration of justice. The chief judge represents provincial court judges and acts as an advocate of the court, along with several other administrative duties. He or she is recommended for appointment by the Minister of Justice and Solicitor General from a list of qualified candidates provided by the chief judge selection panel.

Albertans can enjoy additional activities in their daily lives while the province continues to open up the economy.

“Albertans have demonstrated the care and common sense needed to move forward with our relaunch earlier than initially planned. Our data tells us our active cases are low, hospitalizations are trending downward and people are taking action to protect those most vulnerable and prevent the spread of the virus. We will continue to move forward together to overcome any tough times ahead, but responsible Albertans should be proud of the vigilance they have shown to date.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Current data from June 8 show only 355 active cases and 44 people in hospital across Alberta. This is a decrease of almost 70 per cent in active cases since May 14 – when the province began stage one of the Alberta Relaunch Strategy. With its robust approach to testing, Alberta has performed more COVID-19 tests per capita than most other jurisdictions in the world.
As the province enters stage two of relaunch, safety remains the top priority. More businesses, sport and recreation services can open if they are ready. Some larger gatherings for seated audience events will be permitted. In all cases, public health guidance must be followed.
A new interactive map will help Albertans understand the level of risk in their community and learn about any enhanced health measures at the local level, giving additional information on what they need to do to keep themselves and their loved ones safe and protected. Currently, no communities in Alberta need locally targeted enhanced measures.

“More Albertans can now return to work and to the activities so many of us enjoy. However, I encourage you to do it safely. Think of the people in your life who may be at high risk from COVID-19 and protect all those around you as you would want your loved ones protected. Stay home if you are sick. Stay two metres apart and wear a non-medical mask if you can’t. Consider downloading the ABTraceTogether app, and wash your hands often.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

What can open with restrictions

K-12 schools, for requested diploma exams and summer school, following guidance
Libraries
More surgeries
Wellness services such as massage, acupuncture and reflexology
Personal services (esthetics, cosmetic skin and body treatments, manicures, pedicures, waxing, facial treatment, artificial tanning)
Indoor recreation, fitness, and sports, including gyms and arenas
Movie theatres and theatres
Community halls
Team sports
Pools for leisure swimming
VLTs in restaurants and bars
Casinos and bingo halls (but not table games)
Instrumental concerts

The 50 per cent capacity limit for provincial campgrounds is also being lifted. Over the coming days, the online reservation system will be updated and sites will come online in phases. By July 1, all camping sites will be open for reservations. First-come, first-served sites may open sooner. Information on additional sites will be added to alberta.parks.ca when they become available.
Events and gatherings can be larger in stage two
Maximum 50 people:

Indoor social gatherings – including wedding and funeral receptions, and birthday parties

Maximum 100 people:

Outdoor events and indoor seated/audience events – including wedding and funeral ceremonies

No cap on the number of people (with public health measures and physical distancing in place):

Worship gatherings
Restaurants, cafés, lounges and bars
Casinos
Bingo halls

There is more flexibility for ‘cohort’ groups – small groups of people whose members do not always keep two metres apart:

A household can increase its close interactions with other households to a maximum of 15 people
Performers can have a cohort of up to 50 people (cast members or performers)
Sports teams can play in region-only cohorts of up to 50 players (mini leagues)
People could be part of a sports/performing and household cohort

Everyone is encouraged to follow public health guidelines and notify others in the cohort(s) if they have symptoms or test positive for COVID-19. If they do test positive or have symptoms, mandatory isolation is required.
Still not approved in stage two

Social gatherings that exceed above listed maximums
Regular in-school classes for kindergarten to Grade 12. Classes will resume September 2020
Vocal concerts (as singing carries a higher risk of transmission)
Major festivals and concerts, large conferences, trade shows and events (as these are non-seated social events and/or vocal concerts)
Nightclubs
Amusement parks
Hookah lounges (permitted for food and drink only)
Major sporting events and tournaments
Non-essential travel outside the province is not recommended. This recommendation will not be lifted until stage three of the relaunch strategy.

The success of stage two will determine when Alberta progresses to stage three. Factors are active cases, health-care system capacity, hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) cases, and infection rates. For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.
Quick facts

Relaunch stages include an evaluation and monitoring period to determine if restrictions should be adjusted. Triggers that will inform decisions include active cases, hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy.
Active cases, the percentage of positive results and the rate of infection will be monitored to inform proactive responses in localized areas of the province.
Decisions will be applied at both provincial and local levels, where necessary. While restrictions are gradually eased across the province, an outbreak may mean that they need to be strengthened temporarily in a local area.
Physical distancing and good hygiene are the most important measures to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.
Clean your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching your face, cough or sneeze into your elbow or sleeve, and dispose of tissues appropriately.

Selon de rigoureuses données de dépistage, le nombre de cas actifs de la COVID-19 en Alberta étant inférieur aux prévisions, la deuxième étape de la stratégie de relance peut donc être amorcée en toute sécurité le 12 juin, soit une semaine plus tôt que prévu.
La population albertaine peut profiter de nouvelles activités au quotidien, alors que la relance de l’économie de la province se poursuit.

« Les Albertaines et les Albertains ont fait preuve de la prudence et du bon sens nécessaires pour pouvoir amorcer la prochaine étape de notre relance plus tôt que prévu. Selon nos données, le nombre de cas actifs est faible, la tendance des hospitalisations est à la baisse et la population prend des mesures pour protéger les personnes les plus vulnérables et prévenir la propagation du virus. Certes, nous poursuivrons nos efforts collectifs pour surmonter les difficultés à venir, mais la population albertaine peut s’enorgueillir de la vigilance dont elle a fait preuve jusqu’à présent. »
Jason Kenney, premier ministre

Selon les données actuelles du 8 juin, l’Alberta n’enregistre que 355 cas actifs et 44 hospitalisations. Il s’agit d’un recul de près de 70 % depuis le 14 mai, date à laquelle la province a amorcé la première étape de la Stratégie de relance de l’Alberta. Grâce à un rigoureux protocole en matière de dépistage, c’est en Alberta qu’ont été effectués le plus grand nombre de tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 par habitant à l’échelle mondiale.
La sécurité demeure primordiale à l’aube de la deuxième étape de relance de la province. D’autres entreprises et centres de sports et de loisirs peuvent rouvrir s’ils sont prêts. De plus grands événements destinés à un public assis seront autorisés. Les consignes de santé publique doivent être respectées en toutes circonstances.
Les Albertaines et les Albertains pourront se faire une meilleure idée du niveau de risque propre à leur collectivité et des mesures de santé renforcées à l’échelle locale en consultant la nouvelle carte interactive qui offre des renseignements supplémentaires sur la manière de préserver leur santé et leur sécurité ainsi que celles de leurs proches. Aucune collectivité ne nécessite de mesures de santé renforcées à l’heure actuelle.

« Un plus grand nombre d’Albertains et d’Albertaines peuvent reprendre le travail et les activités que nous sommes nombreux à apprécier. Toutefois, je vous encourage à être prudents. Songez aux personnes de votre entourage qui présentent un risque élevé de contracter la COVID-19 et protégez les gens que vous côtoyez comme vous le feriez pour vos proches. Restez chez vous si vous êtes malade. Respectez un éloignement physique de deux mètres entre vous et les autres et, si cela est impossible, portez un masque non médical. Songez à télécharger l’application ABTraceTogether (en anglais seulement) et lavez-vous les mains fréquemment. »
Dre Deena Hinshaw, médecin-hygiéniste en chef

Réouvertures et reprises assorties de restrictions

Écoles de la maternelle à la douzième année, pour les examens sanctionnés par un diplôme, et les cours d’été, selon les directives
Bibliothèques
Un plus grand nombre d’interventions chirurgicales
Services de bien-être (p. ex. massothérapie, acuponcture et réflexologie)
Services de soins personnels (soins esthétiques, traitements cosmétiques et corporels, manucures, pédicures, épilation à la cire, traitements faciaux, bronzage en cabine)
Loisirs en salle, centres de conditionnement physique et de sport, y compris les gymnases et les arénas
Salles de cinéma et théâtres
Salles communautaires
Sports d’équipe

Terminaux de loterie vidéo dans les restaurants et les bars
Casinos et salles de bingo (à l’exception des jeux sur table)
Concerts de musique instrumentale

La réduction de moitié de la capacité dans les terrains de camping provinciaux est aussi levée. Dans les prochains jours, le système de réservations en ligne sera actualisé et les terrains y deviendront progressivement accessibles. D’ici au 1er juillet, il sera possible de faire des réservations dans tous les terrains de camping. Les terrains de camping qui appliquent une politique du premier arrivé, premier servi pourraient ouvrir avant cette date. Des renseignements sur d’autres sites seront ajoutés dans alberta.parks.ca (en anglais seulement) dès leur réouverture.
De plus grands événements et rassemblements sont autorisés à l’étape 2
Maximum de 50 personnes :

Rassemblements à l’intérieur – y compris les réceptions de mariage et de funérailles, et les fêtes d’anniversaire

Maximum de 100 personnes :

Événements à l’extérieur et à l’intérieur où l’assistance est assise, y compris les cérémonies de mariage et les funérailles

Nombre de personnes illimité (à condition que les consignes de santé publique et d’éloignement physique soient respectées) :

Rassemblements confessionnels
Restaurants, cafés, salons et bars
Casinos
Salles de bingo

Les restrictions seront assouplies pour les « cohortes » (petits groupes de personnes ne respectant pas toujours l’éloignement de deux mètres) :

un ménage peut avoir de plus nombreuses interactions avec d’autres ménages, jusqu’à concurrence de 15 personnes;
des artistes peuvent se produire devant une cohorte de 50 personnes ou moins (acteurs de théâtre ou artistes de spectacle)
les équipes sportives composées d’un maximum de 50 membres peuvent jouer dans des cohortes régionales seulement (mini ligues);
des personnes peuvent faire partie d’une cohorte sportive, d’une cohorte offrant des spectacles ou d’une cohorte composée de plusieurs ménages.

Tout le monde est encouragé à respecter les consignes de santé publique et à informer les autres membres de la cohorte s’ils présentent des symptômes de la COVID-19 ou si leur test de dépistage de la COVID-19 est positif. S’ils présentent des symptômes de la maladie ou si leur test de dépistage est positif, ils doivent obligatoirement s’isoler.
Ce qui n’est toujours pas autorisé à la deuxième étape

Rassemblements dont le nombre de personnes excède les maximums susmentionnés
Cours en salle de classe habituels de la maternelle à la douzième année. Les cours en salle de classe reprendront en septembre 2020.
Concerts avec chanteurs (le chant comportant un risque supérieur de transmission)
Festivals et concerts, grandes conférences, salons professionnels et événements commerciaux (où le public est debout)
Boîtes de nuit
Parcs d’attractions
Salons de houka (services de nourriture et de boissons seulement)
Grands événements et tournois sportifs
Les déplacements non essentiels à l’extérieur de la province sont déconseillés. Cette recommandation ne sera pas levée avant la troisième étape de la stratégie de relance.

Le moment où le gouvernement de l’Alberta amorcera la troisième étape dépendra du succès de la deuxième étape. Les facteurs pris en considération sont le nombre de cas actifs, la capacité du réseau des soins de santé, le nombre d’hospitalisations et de cas en soins intensifs ainsi que le taux d’infection. Pour obtenir de plus amples renseignements, veuillez consulter alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy (en anglais seulement).
En bref

Les étapes de la relance comprennent une période d’évaluation et de surveillance qui permet de déterminer si un rajustement des restrictions s’impose. Les éléments déclencheurs qui orienteront les décisions sont, notamment, le nombre de cas actifs et d’hospitalisations ainsi que le taux d’occupation en soins intensifs.
La surveillance des cas actifs, du pourcentage de résultats positifs et du taux d’infection déterminera si des interventions proactives s’imposent dans certaines parties de la province.
Les décisions s’appliqueront à l’échelle de la province ou à l’échelle locale, au besoin. Bien qu’il y ait un assouplissement progressif des restrictions dans l’ensemble de la province, en cas d’éclosion, ces restrictions pourraient être renforcées localement.
L’éloignement physique et l’hygiène sont les mesures les plus importantes à observer pour prévenir les maladies respiratoires, y compris la COVID-19.
Lavez-vous les mains fréquemment pendant au moins 20 secondes, ne vous touchez pas le visage, toussez et éternuez dans votre coude ou dans votre manche et jetez les mouchoirs en papier usagés comme il se doit.

Alberta Music, the National Music Centre, CKUA and Stagehand are partnering with support from the province to deliver Alberta Spotlight, a weekly online concert series featuring Alberta musicians. The funding will go directly to Alberta artists who will be performing.

At this precious point in history we are honoured to be a part of Alberta Spotlight, providing an opportunity for artists to perform and connect with audiences when they, and we, need it most.

Andrew Mosker, président et directeur général du Centre national de musique


« Depuis plus de 92 ans, dans les bons comme dans les mauvais moments, CKUA unit les Albertains et les Albertaines grâce à la musique, aux arts et à la culture. À ce moment précieux de l'histoire, c’est un honneur pour nous de faire partie du programme d’Alberta Spotlight, qui offre aux artistes l'occasion de se produire et d'entrer en contact avec le public alors qu’eux-mêmes, tout comme nous tous et toutes, en ont le plus besoin. Les artistes font partie du cœur et de l'âme de notre province, et cette vitrine de la diversité musicale albertaine contribuera à montrer à quel point ils sont essentiels à notre communauté. »

In March, government introduced new and expanded billing codes for virtual care to aid in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Virtual care has been an important part of our COVID-19 response, protecting patients, doctors, and clinic staff by providing an alternative to office visits that avoids the risk of contact with the virus. These visits have proved their value, so we’re making them permanent, to allow physicians and patients to keep using them as appropriate while being fairly compensated.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

All existing rules for virtual care codes remain in place.
Quick facts

Permanent billing codes include patient visits, consultations, and mental health services provided over the phone or through secure video conference.
In-person physician and specialist care will continue. Virtual services will be offered by physicians and specialists where appropriate.
These permanent virtual codes will not be subject to the daily patient visit cap.
Details of the changes are communicated in Bulletin 231.
Rates vary depending on specialty and service, and are the same as current basic in-person rates.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




On July 2, 2018, a 31-year-old man was in a residence in Valhalla Centre when unidentified perpetrators attacked the residence and fired upon the occupants. While one occupant was injured during the incident, the 31-year-old man was able to flee the area in a very distinctive vehicle. As RCMP officers began to investigate the incident, they sought to locate and interview the man as a witness to the events and, indeed, as the possible intended victim.
On July 3, 2018, an off-duty RCMP officer observed what he believed to be the vehicle in question parked at the Chickadee Creek rest stop west of Whitecourt, and provided this information to nearby RCMP members.
Shortly after 12:15 p.m., officers attended the location and found the vehicle parked with what appeared to be one occupant asleep in the reclined driver’s seat. The officers approached the vehicle and a confrontation occurred, during which the vehicle was put into motion. One officer discharged a service pistol at the vehicle while a second officer discharged a carbine rifle. The vehicle left the rest stop, crossed the highway and entered a ditch a short distance away.
The RCMP Emergency Response Team (ERT) was called in to clear the scene and located the 31-year-old-man deceased in the driver’s seat, having sustained several gunshot wounds.
ASIRT conducted a thorough and independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident. Upon reviewing the evidence, ASIRT executive director Susan D. Hughson, Q.C., determined that the evidence was capable of providing reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence(s) had been committed and, accordingly, on Aug. 22, 2019, the completed investigation was forwarded to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service (ACPS) for an opinion on whether the case met their standard for prosecution. On May 29, 2020, ASIRT received the completed final opinion. Having carefully reviewed the completed investigation and the provided position of the Crown, Ms. Hughson concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that criminal offences had been committed and that the two RCMP officers who discharged their firearms should be charged.
On June 5, Cpl. Randy Stenger and Const. Jessica Brown, both RCMP officers with the Whitecourt RCMP detachment, were arrested and each charged with one count of criminal negligence causing death in relation to the death of the 31-year-old man, Clayton Crawford, contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code.
Both officers were released on an undertaking with conditions, including a prohibition from the possession of firearms, to appear in Whitecourt Provincial Court on July 14.
As these matters are now before the courts, ASIRT will not provide any further information in relation to these incidents. 
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

“Over the last week, we have seen Albertans rightfully outraged over an appalling act of police brutality in the United States. Many Albertans have also raised sincere concerns about policing here at home. 
“Police officers serve Albertans, and the overwhelming majority do so honourably. But incidents of abuse undermine faith in the system as a whole. As Minister of Justice and Solicitor General, my job is to not only ensure people feel safe, but that people feel confident that justice is being done.
“Any allegation of excessive use of force by law enforcement is serious and must be treated as such. That is why we will expedite the government’s current work to modernize the Police Act. This will ensure we have the governance framework and policies in place so Albertans are confident that our police are accountable to the communities they protect. Policing only works when citizens feel assured that law enforcement is going to treat them reasonably and fairly.
“At the earliest opportunity, we will be meeting with the chiefs of police, First Nations, minority community leaders, and other stakeholders to work collaboratively to accelerate this effort.
“We also call on the federal minister of public safety to review the legislation and regulations governing the RCMP to address the concerns of Canadians.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Led by MLA Tracy Allard, the results of the consultation will inform the drafting of updated regulations and legislation this fall.

“Hearing from Albertans will allow us to work towards a more streamlined, easy-to-navigate system that ensures parents and families have access to high-quality, safe and accessible child care choices. Our aim is to ensure the updated legislation is informed by those who use it every day.”  
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services


“I know how important child care is for families and how challenging it can be to find the right option. I firmly believe the best way to improve any organization or system is to hear directly from the people involved. I am honoured to lead this consultation process and collect feedback from Albertans who rely on and work in the child care sector.”
Tracy Allard, MLA for Grande Prairie

To ensure physical distancing, child care operators and industry associations will participate in virtual table talk sessions. An online survey will also be available to parents, early childhood educators and operators, beginning June 15. The survey will be on alberta.ca and will also be sent to parents through their child care centre.
Preliminary conversations with the sector indicated that, despite many changes due to the pandemic, this review is important and should proceed. Now more than ever, child care is a priority for many Albertans and fulfils a commitment made last year to consult prior to updating the legislation and regulations. It will also allow the Government of Alberta to enshrine principles of quality child care within legislation, rather than through the previous system of accreditation.
Quick facts

The Child Care Licensing Regulation is set to expire on Jan. 31, 2021, and requires revision to modernize provisions and ensure safety and quality.
This consultation will consider all existing categories of licensed child care, including out-of-school care, as well as approved family day homes and preschool.
There are more than 2,900 active licensed/approved programs in Alberta with more than 138,000 child care spaces in Alberta.
There are more than 726,200 children age 12 and under in Alberta. About 105,300 of these children are enrolled in regulated child care spaces.
Prior to being elected to represent Grande Prairie in the legislature, MLA Allard was a successful small business owner and community volunteer, and is a mother of three children.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




People can visit one of almost 600 A&W, McDonald’s Canada, or Tim Hortons drive-thrus in the province to receive four non-medical masks. Masks are free and no purchase is necessary.
Albertans are encouraged to pick up masks for family members and friends, especially those who may not be able to get to a drive-thru, to reduce traffic. Masks are being distributed on the honour system, and people are asked to respect the limit of one package of four masks per Albertan to ensure everyone who wants masks can get them.
Masks have also been provided to many municipalities, First Nations communities, Metis Settlements, and local agencies. This includes rural and remote communities that do not have access to a partner restaurant drive-thru and are developing their own distribution plans.
To learn more, visit alberta.ca/masks.
This initiative is part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely reduce public health restrictions and reopen our economy. For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.

“We’re proud to be the first province in Canada to support residents with free masks for use in situations where physical distancing may not be possible. Thank you to our restaurant partners, franchise owners and staff members, who are volunteering their time and effort to distribute these masks.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“Our restaurants have done a great job behind the scenes, getting ready to help distribute masks in communities across Alberta. We’re looking forward to welcoming lots of Albertans at our drive-thrus in the coming days.”
Susan Senecal, president and CEO, A&W Canada


“At McDonald’s Canada, we continue to be inspired by the ways Canadians come together to take care of each other.?The opportunity to partner with the Alberta government on this initiative is another way for us to show our commitment to the communities we serve. Our restaurant teams are ready to distribute non-medical masks effectively and safely to all Albertans.”
Jeff Kroll, restaurant support officer and COVID Response lead, McDonald’s Canada


“Throughout the pandemic, the 1,500 Tim Hortons owners across Canada have been eagerly supporting their communities and stepping up to answer calls for assistance. Our restaurant owners in Alberta and their team members are eager to participate in this important program to distribute masks to Albertans. Personally, I feel very proud of our owners in Alberta, and their commitment to serve their communities. There was no hesitation to take part in this, only excitement to contribute to such an important initiative.”
Mike Hancock, chief operating officer, Tim Hortons

Quick facts

About 95 per cent of Albertans live within 10 kilometres of these drive-thrus.
Mask use is not mandatory; they are an option for situations where maintaining a distance of two metres is not possible.
This program is intended to supplement an individual’s efforts to acquire non-medical masks. Albertans who wish to use non-medical masks are encouraged to purchase their own supply from local retailers in addition to using those provided by government.
Masks are being provided to seniors facilities and organizations that support vulnerable populations for distribution to their residents, clients and program members. These masks are not available to the general public. 
The cities of Edmonton and Calgary have each been supplied 500,000 masks, and will be responsible for distributing them mainly through their transit operations.
Planning is underway to supply masks to places of worship across Alberta.
Plans to distribute another 20 million masks are being developed.
Instructions for proper care and use of non-medical masks are available at alberta.ca/masks.

“In the early hours of June 6, 1944, some 14,000 Canadian soldiers were crammed aboard transports off the coast of Normandy, awaiting orders to go ashore. Supported by seamen, airmen and paratroopers, their objective was Juno Beach and, ultimately, the opening of a second front in western Europe.
“The Allies had deceived the Nazis about the timing and location of their attacks, but defences were entrenched along France’s Atlantic coast. Canada’s soldiers would charge straight into the teeth of the German military.
“No words can describe the courage and discipline this took. Our soldiers made landfall in a maelstrom of bullets, bombs and smoke. Before the day was done, 359 would die. And once the beachhead was secure, months of hard fighting, death and suffering lay ahead in the push to break out of Normandy. But the front was opened and the Nazis’ days were numbered.
“As living memory fades, the valour of everyone who served on D-Day will endure, preserved by our reverence and respect. And the rows of graves at the Canadian War Cemetery in Bény-sur-Mer will always stand as silent proof of Canadians’ willingness to risk it all for freedom.
“This D-Day, we remember those who fought and died on that historic beach. Let’s vow to live in a way that honours their sacrifice.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Calgary advanced technology firm Exergy Solutions designed and built the ventilators. Suncor Energy provided financial support to make the donation possible. A cross-industry team of partners from across the province worked together to ensure the success of the project.
The ventilators, named Alberta E-Vent and nicknamed “Bertie,” were built in part through 3D printing technology. They are intended to provide short-term respiratory support, monitoring, and treatment for adult patients if a conventional ventilator is unavailable.
Should the need arise, Alberta E-Vent will allow hospitals to expand their patient care capacity and reallocate conventional ventilators to patients with more complex needs.

“Alberta is incredibly fortunate to have private-sector firms like Exergy and Suncor step in to make sure its health system is well supplied with critical medical technology. The creation of the Alberta E-Vent ventilator shows what’s possible when Albertans collaborate and focus their expertise on a common goal.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The 200 ventilators are approved by Health Canada and are expected to be donated this week. Exergy and Suncor are exploring the possibility of expanding production to help fight the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

“This pandemic has reinforced that when we work together across governments and industries we can accomplish much more than we can do when we work alone. The support we’ve provided to this project is another example of how we’re working with partners in the fight against COVID-19.” 
Mike MacSween, executive vice-president, Suncor Energy


“The Exergy team had the technology and agile engineering to develop the ventilator quickly, but we needed help, so we reached out and engaged with experts from other organizations to get the design right. I am proud to work with a team that was able to execute a year-long project in six weeks and to do so with passion and tenacity. The Bertie is truly a ‘made-in-Alberta solution.’”
Ian Buchanan, vice-president technical services, Exergy Solutions

Quick facts

Alberta Health Services (AHS) is the provincial health authority responsible for planning and delivering health supports and services for Albertans.
AHS facilitated this project through its Ventilator Collaborative, which brings together clinicians, industry representatives, volunteers and collaborators.
	
Teams from the University of Calgary supported the mechanical design and testing of the project.
Logican Technologies in Edmonton are doing final assembly of the ventilators.
Many other companies played pivotal roles in the collaboration, including Catch Engineering, PLC Electronic Solutions from Vancouver, Global Power Technologies and Laser Equation.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The program will include up to $1 million to help beekeepers offset the costs of increased colony replacements due to COVID-19. The program, available this summer, will be retroactive to cover issues faced in spring 2020.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made importing colony replacements from usual, more affordable sources like New Zealand and Australia more difficult.
Program details are still being developed. Producers are encouraged to subscribe to Alberta’s Canadian Agricultural Partnership site, where information will be shared as it becomes available.

“Beekeepers not only help pollinate important crops across Alberta, they make delicious honey products. They have a crucial role in Alberta’s agriculture sector, which is why we are committed to supporting beekeepers with an investment of up to $1 million. This new program will keep our bee industry competitive after this difficult year.” 
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


“As our primary pollinators, the importance of bees to our agriculture sector cannot be overstated. This collaborative investment will help Alberta’s beekeepers continue their vital work and keep their operations strong.”

“The Alberta Beekeepers Commission is very pleased with the support of the Ministry during this challenging and exceptional time. The commission is grateful for all the hard work and vision to creating a sustainable future for beekeepers by the minister and ministry staff in the development of this new CAP program.”

Quick facts

Alberta is the largest producer of honey in Canada, producing 41 million pounds annually and contributing $67 million to the economy.
The program will support 168 commercial beekeepers in
	Alberta and will help the sector adapt to emerging challenges
	and overcome over-wintering losses in a COVID-19
	environment.
It is anticipated that the $1-million program will be able to support about 13,000 replacement colonies.
The Canadian Agricultural Partnership is a five-year, $3-billion federal-provincial-territorial investment in the agriculture, agri-food and agri-based products sector.

The government will continue to provide Alberta’s businesses and non-profits with additional supports as they deal with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These new programs complement Alberta’s existing business supports, which are the most comprehensive in Canada.

“Alberta is proud to lead the country in providing relief and support to protect jobs and keep businesses open. We have taken the time to listen directly to job creators, and are acting to address their needs. Our focus remains on ensuring a safe relaunch to get Albertans back to work and our economy back on track.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

New grants will ease relaunch costs faced by businesses
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many small- and medium-sized businesses and non-profits in Alberta have shutdown, either completely or partially, leading to severely limited sales. As they begin to reopen, the increased cost to operate under public health requirements are causing further stress among business owners and non-profits.
To ease the impacts of new measures, businesses and non-profits need support to reopen. Government is committing up to $200 million in funding for eligible businesses and non-profits to access up to $5,000 to offset a portion of their relaunch costs. These funds can be used for implementing measures to minimize the risk of virus transmission, (such as physical barriers, personal protective equipment and disinfecting supplies), rent, employee wages or replacement of inventory.
The program’s online application is expected to be available in the coming weeks. Program details, including eligibility, are being confirmed.

“The Province is stepping up to provide further support for businesses still reeling from the impacts of COVID-19. These grants will help businesses with desperately-needed revenue, and ensure we emerge from this pandemic with enough strength to weather the economic headwinds Alberta faces.”
Janet Riopel, President and CEO, Edmonton Chamber of Commerce

Ending the fear of commercial tenant eviction
Many Alberta businesses are facing challenges paying their rent during the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to feel the economic pressure even as their businesses reopen.
To help ease the economic pinch, government is planning further measures including legislation to ensure commercial tenants will not face rent increases or be evicted for non-payment of rent due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The new measures will help address shortfalls in the current Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program, and will give eligible business owners piece of mind as they reopen and help with the provincial economic recovery.
Additional details are expected to be finalized during the current summer session.

“CFIB is pleased the Alberta government has listened and heard the concerns of small business owners who fear being evicted. Commercial eviction protection provides a safety net for small businesses struggling to make rent payments and cannot access relief through the Canadian Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program. A direct cash support program will also help small businesses who have fallen through funding gaps of federal and provincial support programs cover fixed costs such as rent, bills payments and PPE.”
Annie Dormuth, Alberta provincial affairs director, Canadian Federation of Independent Business

WCB premiums deferral for private sector businesses and support for small and medium businesses
As announced in March, government is committed to easing the economic burden on businesses by deferring WCB premiums. Private sector employers are saving money on their WCB premium payments now, when they need it most. These actions ensure the sustainability of the workers’ compensation system and that injured workers continue to receive the benefits and supports they need to return to work.

Private sector employers have immediate financial relief, with WCB premiums deferred for one year, until early 2021.
Employers who have already paid their WCB premium payment for 2020-21 are eligible for a rebate or credit.
For small and medium businesses, the government is covering 50 percent of the premium when it is due.
	
The average small business is expected to save about $1,000 this year.
The average medium business is expected to save about $20,000 this year.


Large employers are receiving a break having their 2020 WCB premium payments deferred until 2021, at which time their premiums will be due.
Paying 50 per cent of small and medium private sector WCB premiums for 2020 will cost government approximately $350 million.


“I have engaged with thousands of businesses since the start of the pandemic and have been carefully listening to their feedback. This announcement addresses the number one ask we had from businesses. We’re working to make sure Alberta’s businesses can continue to survive through this trying time. The supports announced today will help make sure we’re well positioned during the province’s economic recovery.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism


“As a Senior Care provider our requirement to adhere to the many Health directives, to keep our residents and staff safe, and maintain quality care, have resulted in significant cost increases.  The relief from WCB premiums is one of the few financial assistance programs that we are eligible for, and for that we are grateful.” 
Dawn Harsch, President and CEO, Exquisicare Senior Living and Care at Home

Additional supports for small businesses
Government has taken significant steps to help Alberta businesses get the relief and support needed to weather the pandemic and be better positioned for recovery. These supports include:

freezing education property taxes at 2019 levels and provided businesses with a six-month education property tax deferral;
deferring corporate income tax payments to August 31, 2020, interest free;
introducing a 90-day utility payment relief;
providing a two-month filing deadline extension for annual returns with Alberta Corporate Registry; and
deferring of the Tourism Levy for hotels and other lodging providers.
Energy sector:
	
Committed to a $1.5 billion equity investment in 2020 towards the Keystone XL pipeline project and a $6 billion loan guarantee in 2021.
$113 million towards the Alberta Energy Regulator to waive industry levies for a period of six months.
$100 million loan to the Orphan Well Association.


Deferral of loan payments at ATB Financial and credit unions
Deferral of timber dues for six months
Support for continuing care facilities
Up to $24.5 million is being advanced to help continuing care facilities operators address immediate cost pressures.
$7.3 million per month for:
	
increased health-care aide staffing levels
a wage top-up of an additional $2 per hour for health-care aides
Up to $3.5 million for 1,000 paid student practicum positions


Relief for the child care sector
	
Up to $17.8 million in grants for the child care sector


Supporting Alberta’s agriculture industry
	
Up to $5 million to the Agriculture Training Support Program, including about $1 million for meat processors to provide support for new hires for meat-cutting training.
An increase to the interim payment under AgriStability from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for both the hog sector and the potato industry.
Alberta will contribute up to $17 million in Agri-Recovery funding, which is split 60/40 with the federal government for a fed-cattle set aside program. This will allow producers to hold onto slaughter-ready cattle on a maintenance feed ration for up to nine weeks, ultimately allowing the supply of animals to more evenly match demand and reduced processing capacity.




De nouveaux programmes d’aide à la reprise et de nouvelles mesures pour la tenance commerciale des petites et moyennes entreprises de l’Alberta sont mis en œuvre pendant la phase de relance économique
Grâce à des mesures supplémentaires, le gouvernement continuera à aider les entreprises et les organismes sans but lucratif de l’Alberta à composer avec les répercussions de la pandémie de COVID-19. Ces nouveaux programmes viennent s’ajouter aux programmes d’aide déjà offerts aux entreprises de l’Alberta, qui sont les plus complets au Canada.

« L’Alberta est fière d’être en tête au Canada sur le plan du soutien apporté pour protéger les emplois et assurer la pérennité des entreprises. Nous avons bien écouté les créateurs d’emplois et nous prenons des mesures pour répondre à leurs besoins. Notre objectif est toujours d’assurer une relance économique en toute sécurité pour permettre à la population albertaine de reprendre le travail et de rétablir l’économie. »
Jason Kenney, premier ministre

De nouvelles subventions réduiront les coûts de relance imposés aux entreprises
Beaucoup de petites et moyennes entreprises et d’organismes sans but lucratif en l’Alberta, contraintes d’interrompre ou de réduire leurs activités pendant la pandémie de COVID-19, ont vu leurs ventes fortement chuter. La hausse des coûts de fonctionnement qu’entraînent les exigences en matière de santé publique est une source de stress supplémentaire pour les propriétaires d’entreprises et les organismes sans but lucratif qui commencent à rouvrir.
Pour atténuer les effets de ces nouvelles mesures, les entreprises et les organismes sans but lucratif ont besoin d’aide pour rouvrir leurs portes. Le gouvernement s’engage à investir jusqu’à 200 millions de dollars pour aider les entreprises et organismes sans but lucratif admissibles à obtenir jusqu’à 5 000 $ pour compenser une partie des coûts de relance. Ces fonds pourront leur servir à prendre des mesures d’atténuation des risques de transmission du virus (p. ex. des barrières physiques, de l’équipement de protection individuelle et des produits de désinfection), et à payer un loyer, le salaire des employés ou à assurer le remplacement de leurs stocks.
Il sera possible de s’inscrire en ligne à ce programme d’ici quelques semaines. Les détails du programme, y compris l’admissibilité à celui-ci, seront bientôt confirmés.

« La province apporte une aide supplémentaire aux entreprises qui ne se sont pas encore remises des conséquences de la pandémie de COVID-19. Grâce à ces subventions, les entreprises pourront accroître le revenu qui leur est absolument nécessaire et nous aurons ainsi les moyens de sortir de cette pandémie avec suffisamment de force pour affronter le ralentissement économique que connaît l’Alberta. »
Janet Riopel, première dirigeante de la Edmonton Chamber of Commerce (chambre de commerce d’Edmonton)

Apaiser les craintes d’expulsion des locataires commerciaux
Beaucoup d’entreprises albertaines peinent à payer leurs loyers pendant la pandémie de COVID-19 et elles continueront à en ressentir les répercussions sur le plan économique après la réouverture de leur commerce.
Pour atténuer ces pressions économiques, le gouvernement compte prendre d’autres mesures, notamment l’adoption d’une loi interdisant l’augmentation des coûts des loyers commerciaux et l’expulsion pour non-paiement des loyers dans le contexte de l’état d’urgence sanitaire associé à la COVID-19. Les nouvelles mesures viendront compléter le programme en vigueur d’Aide d’urgence du Canada pour le loyer commercial; elles offriront la tranquillité d’esprit aux propriétaires d’entreprises admissibles qui rouvriront leur commerce et elles permettront d’appuyer la reprise économique de la province.
D’autres détails devraient être confirmés durant la session d’été qui est en cours.

« Pour la Fédération canadienne de l’entreprise indépendante, il est réjouissant que le gouvernement de l’Alberta ait tenu compte des craintes d’expulsion des propriétaires de petites entreprises. La protection contre l’expulsion de locaux commerciaux rassure les propriétaires de petites entreprises qui peinent à payer leur loyer et qui ne peuvent pas obtenir l’Aide d’urgence du Canada pour le loyer commercial. Un programme d’aide en espèces direct viendra aussi aider les petites entreprises pour qui les programmes d’aide du gouvernement fédéral et du gouvernement provincial n’ont pas suffi pour payer les coûts fixes tels que le loyer, le paiement des factures et l’équipement de protection personnel. »
Annie Dormuth, directrice des affaires provinciales de l’Alberta, Fédération canadienne de l’entreprise indépendante

Report des primes de la Commission des accidents du travail (CAT) pour les entreprises privées et soutien aux petites et moyennes entreprises
Conformément à l’annonce faite en mars, le gouvernement s’engage à alléger le fardeau économique des entreprises en reportant les primes de la Commission des accidents du travail. Les employeurs du secteur privé économisent de l’argent en ne versant pas de primes de la Commission des accidents du travail au moment où ils en ont le plus besoin, soit maintenant. Ces mesures garantissent la viabilité du système d’indemnisation des accidents du travail et permettent aux travailleurs blessés de continuer à toucher les prestations et l’aide dont ils ont besoin pour retourner travailler.

Les employeurs du secteur privé bénéficient d’un allégement financier immédiat, les primes de la Commission des accidents du travail étant reportées jusqu’au début de 2021.
Les employeurs qui ont déjà payé leur cotisation à la Commission des accidents du travail pour 2020-2021 recevront une remise ou un crédit.
Dans le cas des petites et moyennes entreprises, le gouvernement acquittera la moitié de leur prime à l’échéance du paiement.
	
La petite entreprise moyenne devrait économiser environ 1 000 $ cette année.
L’entreprise moyenne devrait économiser environ 20 000 $ cette année.


Dans le cas des gros employeurs, le paiement des primes de la Commission des accidents du travail de 2020 est reporté d’un an, soit jusqu’en 2021, après quoi ils devront verser leurs primes.
Le paiement de la moitié des primes de la Commission des accidents du travail des petites et moyennes entreprises privées en 2020 coûtera environ 350 millions de dollars au gouvernement.


« J’ai consulté des milliers d’entreprises depuis le début de la pandémie et j’ai été très attentive à ce qu’elles avaient à dire. Cette annonce répond à la principale demande des entreprises. Nous voulons que les entreprises de l’Alberta puissent garder la tête hors de l’eau pendant cette période difficile. Les mesures d’aide annoncées aujourd’hui permettront de veiller à ce que nous soyons en bonne posture lors la reprise économique de la province. »
Tanya Fir, ministre du Développement économique, du Commerce et du Tourisme


« En tant que fournisseur de soins aux personnes âgées, nous devons respecter de nombreuses mesures d’hygiène, assurer la santé et la sécurité de nos résidents et de nos employés, et prodiguer des soins de grande qualité. Ces exigences ont entraîné des augmentations accrues des coûts. Nous nous réjouissons du report du versement des primes de la Commission des accidents du travail, puisqu’il s’agit de l’une des rares mesures d’aide financière auxquelles nous sommes admissibles. » 
Dawn Harsch, première dirigeante, Exquisicare Senior Living and Care at Home

On that day, at about 9:40 p.m., the Edmonton Police Service (EPS) received a call reporting an alleged hit-and-run accident on Yellowhead Trail near 66 Street. The caller provided a licence plate number and description of the car that, a police check revealed, had been reported as stolen. Police were immediately dispatched to the area.
Two EPS officers attended the scene, a small auto dealership just off Yellowhead Trail and 66 Street, in an unmarked police vehicle. While the unit was unmarked, the emergency police lights were activated, and, as confirmed by civilian witnesses, the fully uniformed officers and unmarked vehicle were both easily identifiable as police.
As the car had been identified as a stolen vehicle, and had allegedly been involved in a hit-and-run accident, officers parked the police vehicle in a manner intended to box that vehicle in, to prevent a possible criminal flight. The vehicle had heavily tinted windows, which severely limited the officers’ ability to see inside it. Two men were visible in the front seats of the vehicle, but it was unknown at the time whether anyone else might be inside. As they exited their police vehicle, one officer approached the driver’s side of the man’s vehicle, while a second officer approached the passenger side.
Both officers gave loud verbal commands for the occupants to exit the vehicle. The front passenger door opened and the man occupying the passenger’s seat exited the vehicle with his hands up, and lay down on the ground as instructed. This man later told ASIRT investigators that the driver had a gun in his lap and had told the passenger to get out of the vehicle.
As one of the officers approached the stolen vehicle from the rear on the driver’s side, he noticed that the tinted rear door window on the driver’s side of the vehicle was rolled down several inches. The officer pointed his flashlight through the gap and observed a long-barrelled firearm in the man’s possession, pointed towards the passenger side of the vehicle. This officer yelled “Gun, get back” at the other officer, and commanded the man to drop the weapon. The man verbally refused, stating that he would not drop the gun, that officers would have to shoot him, and that he would shoot police. The officer observed the man raise his gun, pointed in the direction of the officer on the passenger side. In response to these actions, the officer discharged multiple rounds from his service pistol as the man fired a shot in the direction of the officer on the passenger side of the stolen vehicle.
The officer cleared the vehicle to ensure no other occupants were inside while the other officer maintained control of the passenger. EMS immediately attended the location and, upon their arrival, declared the man deceased on scene.
The man’s firearm was a loaded, sawed-off .30-30-calibre lever-action rifle with one spent cartridge inside the chamber. Subsequent to the shooting, the deceased driver of the stolen vehicle was identified as a 30-year-old man who was, at the time of the incident, unlawfully at large in relation to a federal prison sentence and was wanted on a Canada-wide warrant. An autopsy confirmed the man’s cause of death to be multiple gunshot wounds. A toxicology report confirmed the presence of alcohol, methamphetamine, cocaine, and cannabis in the man’s body.
Under the Criminal Code, a police officer is authorized to use as much force as is reasonably necessary to carry out their lawful duties. In circumstances where an officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that force is necessary to protect themselves or others from death or grievous bodily harm, the force an officer is entitled to use can include potentially lethal force.
In this case, the involved officers were acting within the scope of their lawful duties, and had reasonable grounds to believe that the men had committed an offence. When the man seated in the driver’s seat failed to follow verbal commands to drop the gun and exit the vehicle, and began to raise the firearm in the direction of an officer, he created a risk that was both potentially lethal and immediate. When he actually fired upon that officer, the man demonstrated not just a theoretical risk but an actual real, substantial, and immediate threat to the officer’s life. In the face of this immediate and significant danger, the officer who fired his service weapon was lawfully justified in doing so in defence of himself and the second officer.
After considering all of the circumstances of this matter, it is the opinion of executive director Susan Hughson, Q.C., that the evidence does not provide reasonable grounds, nor even reasonable suspicion, to believe that the officer who fired committed an offence.
The officer’s use of lethal force, which he resorted to only after the man failed to comply with commands and escalated the situation by raising his gun, and, ultimately, firing on police, was reasonable. The risk presented by these actions was both serious and immediate, and both objectively and subjectively gave rise to a risk of grievous bodily harm or death. The decision of the officer to fire his service weapon was lawful, justified and reasonably necessary.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.
 
A sawed-off lever-action rifle was recovered from the man’s possession.
Editor’s note: The age of the deceased was incorrect in the previous version.

The new biorepository is now safely collecting, cataloguing and storing samples in sophisticated refrigeration equipment. There will be two hubs – one at the University of Alberta and the other at the University of Calgary.

“Research in how to test for, treat and prevent COVID-19 is essential to our healthy future. I commend all the partners on collaborating to make this happen, and I assure all Albertans that the biorepository poses no risk to public health.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“We are thinking about the future and about deeper study of the coronavirus through clinical and academic research. We are extremely grateful to our foundation partners for their contributions towards this project that will benefit Albertans today and for years to come.”
Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO, Alberta Health Services

Dozens of Alberta-based researchers working on more than 30 Alberta research projects need the COVID-19 samples to explore things like rapid point-of-care testing, drugs, antibody testing, and genome sequencing. Some studies involve collaborations with scientists across North America.
Building the $300,000 biorepository is a partnership among Calgary Health Trust, University Hospital Foundation, Alberta Cancer Foundation, Stollery Children’s Hospital Foundation, Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation and the Royal Alexandra Hospital Foundation. Alberta Health Services and its subsidiary, Alberta Precision Laboratories, will fund operations and maintenance.

“Calgary Health Trust and our donors recognize that targeted research is needed to enhance our understanding of this highly contagious virus and to accelerate the discovery of effective diagnostics, treatments, and prevention for current and future outbreaks. The partnership between philanthropy and health care means that we can do more faster, and support the innovation that continues to be needed especially during these critical times.”
Mike Meldrum, president and CEO, Calgary Health Trust

Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance physical distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

Bill 17, the Mental Health Amendment Act, proposes amendments to address a 2019 ruling by the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench. That ruling found some sections of the Mental Health Act to be unconstitutional or incomplete. Additional amendments are proposed to modernize the act and reduce red tape.

“The proposed amendments address the concerns raised by the court. And they go further, making real improvements in care that will benefit patients and their families.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Alberta’s Mental Health Act allows for individuals with serious mental health disorders to be involuntarily detained in a designated facility for treatment or to receive mandatory treatment in the community.
To address the court’s requirements, the amendments propose changing the definition of mental disorder so that an individual with a brain injury could not be detained under the act. However, if the individual has both a brain injury and a mental health disorder, the individual could be detained. This means only individuals who require and would benefit from mental health care would be detained.
To safeguard patients’ rights, proposed amendments include requiring hospitals to provide free and timely access to medical records and information about legal counsel and the mental health patient advocate. Facilities would also be required to review forms more promptly, so patients are fully informed about why they are detained. Patients staying in a hospital for more than 30 days would be provided with a treatment plan, including criteria for release, so they know what to expect.

“It is critical individuals interacting with the mental health system understand and are fully able to exercise their rights. The proposed amendments to the Mental Health Act address some of the key areas of concern shared with the mental health patient advocate’s office, providing patients and their caregivers with more timely support and guidance in their mental health journey.”
Janice Harrington, Mental Health Patient Advocate

To update and streamline the act, the amendments propose that nurse practitioners be authorized to assess and examine patients. The amendments also propose allowing the use of video conferencing for assessment and examination, as well as offering more locations that provide this care to reduce travel and wait times.
The amendments propose a number of changes to mental health review panels as well. Patients would be provided with more time to appeal a panel’s decision. Also, panels would be permitted to order additional, independent psychiatric opinions and to request that a facility issue a community treatment order when doing so would be more appropriate.

If passed, Alberta will create a simplified, accessible and swift system for resolving matters involving most first-time impaired driving and other traffic safety offences. By removing these matters from the court system, we will save thousands of hours of police and court time per year, ensuring Alberta’s prosecutors and courts are able focus on the most serious justice matters and more police are patrolling the streets.
This bill would introduce a new Immediate Roadside Sanction program in late 2020 that would keep our roads safer by providing serious, immediate and escalating consequences for all impaired drivers – a system that has been proven to significantly reduce impaired driving and especially impaired driving fatalities in other jurisdictions.

“We have heard loud and clear from Albertans that they are frustrated with seeing cases dropped because of the court backlog we inherited from the previous government. This legislation proposes smart administrative changes that will ensure our courts and police can keep our communities safe by focusing on serious and violent crime.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General

New zero-tolerance consequences for novice drivers and commercial drivers will also be introduced, as will new fines, longer vehicle seizures, mandatory education and lengthy periods of ignition interlock. Repeat offenders, impaired drivers who cause bodily harm or death, and other more serious cases will still receive criminal charges in addition to the other penalties.
While all impaired drivers will face immediate consequences, the government is also creating a faster and more accessible way of resolving disputes to enhance public safety by keeping impaired drivers off the roads. Under the new model, non-criminally-charged drivers can quickly and easily review their tickets online and have their matter completed within 30 days.

“Impaired driving is a very serious offence. I’m proud Alberta is adopting a proven system that reduces impaired driving and impaired driving fatalities. We will get police back on the street to focus on fighting crime instead of bogged down in the courts.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation


“This announcement is good news for policing and the justice system as a whole. With court time being used more appropriately, we will have increased capacity to begin repairing the damage caused by impaired driving and follow other successful models in reducing traffic collisions that cause serious injury or death. An expedient, simplified traffic system also means officers are granted more time in our communities to focus on reducing crime and victimization.”
Dale McFee, chief, Edmonton Police Service, and president, Alberta Association of Chiefs of Police


“MADD Canada welcomes these new laws and sanctions. These streamlined administrative options for certain offenders have proven very effective at reducing impaired driving and saving lives in other provinces. They will do the same in Alberta. We thank the Government of Alberta for its leadership and ongoing efforts to prevent impaired driving.”
Andrew Murie, chief executive officer, MADD Canada

The new impaired driving administrative model is based on changes made in British Columbia, which has seen their rates of impaired driving incidents drop by 36 per cent from 2011 to 2018 and the number of impaired driving fatalities fall by 54 per cent from 2010 to 2018.
Dealing with traffic tickets
If passed, Bill 21 would also create an administrative process for dealing with non-criminal traffic offences. The new online system would be introduced in late 2021 and would be easier and quicker for Albertans to navigate.
These tickets, currently dealt with by the courts, will be handled online by administrative adjudicators – removing almost two million tickets from the courts. This system will be easier to use and Albertans will have their matters dealt with in 30 days, not months or years after the fact to ensure impaired drivers are off the roads as soon as possible.
Quick facts
Increased impaired driving consequences will include:

Fines of up to $2,000.
Increasing length of vehicle seizure from three days to 30.
New mandatory education programs for repeat offenders.
New and longer periods of mandatory ignition interlock, especially for repeat impaired drivers.

Long-term changes to Alberta’s nursing homes regulations will come into effect on Aug. 15. These changes make the temporary amendments, introduced as part of the government’s response to COVID-19, permanent.
The amended regulations remove barriers permanently so nurse practitioners can act as primary care providers in nursing homes, admitting and assessing residents, as well as offering follow-up care. Permanent changes also allow nurse practitioners and other health professionals to prescribe medication and order treatments in nursing homes, according to their scopes of practice.

“We heard from nursing home operators that the changes introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic make a real difference. That’s why our government is making the regulatory changes permanent and ensuring nursing home residents have better access to primary care going forward. Taking swift action to increase nursing home residents’ long-term access to care from nurse practitioners and other health-care providers is part of our promise to make life better for all Albertans, especially seniors and our most vulnerable.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Changes will be made to the two regulations under the Nursing Homes Act: the Nursing Homes General Regulation and the Nursing Homes Operation Regulation.

“Nurse practitioners are an integral part of the patient’s journey, and they play an important role in the delivery of health care across the province. Alberta Health Services supports NPs within AHS to work to full scope of practice. This change will remove legislative barriers and further support the provision of improved, accessible care for residents in long-term care.”
Dr. Verna Yiu, president and chief executive officer, Alberta Health Services


“Nurse practitioners are autonomous practitioners with advanced qualifications that enable them to provide independent primary care in Alberta. We welcome the permanent changes that allow nurse practitioners to work to their full scope in nursing homes and look forward to continuing our work with government to support nurse practitioners working to full scope throughout Alberta’s health system.”
Mary-Elizabeth Cooper, president, Nurse Practitioner Association of Alberta

Nursing home residents can now receive prescriptions for Schedule 1 drugs and orders for common diagnostic tests, like X-rays, ultrasounds and CT scans, directly from nurse practitioners and other qualified health professionals, according to their scopes of practice and at the discretion of the operator. These permanent changes reduce red tape and eliminate unnecessary duplication while increasing access to primary care for nursing home residents.

Les changements apportés à la réglementation concernant les maisons de soins infirmiers de l’Alberta signifient que les résidents pourront accéder directement aux soins de base offerts par des infirmiers praticiens et des infirmières praticiennes après la pandémie de COVID-19.
Les changements à long terme apportés à la réglementation concernant les maisons de soins infirmiers de l’Alberta entreront en vigueur le 15 août. Ces changements rendent permanentes les modifications temporaires, introduites dans le cadre de la réponse du gouvernement à la COVID-19.
La réglementation modifiée donne la liberté aux infirmiers praticiens et aux infirmières praticiennes d’agir en tant que fournisseurs de soins de base dans les maisons de soins infirmiers, d’admettre et d’évaluer les résidents, mais aussi de proposer un suivi. Les changements permanents permettent également au personnel infirmier et aux autres professionnels de la santé de prescrire des médicaments et des traitements dans les maisons de soins infirmiers, selon leur champ d’exercice.

« Les exploitants de maisons de soins infirmiers nous ont indiqué que les modifications introduites pendant la pandémie de la COVID-19 ont véritablement changé les choses. C’est pourquoi notre gouvernement entérine ces modifications à la réglementation et garantit ainsi aux résidents des maisons de soins infirmiers un meilleur accès aux soins primaires à l’avenir. La prise de mesures rapides visant à accroître l’accès à long terme des résidents des maisons de soins infirmiers aux soins d’infirmiers praticiens et d’infirmières praticiennes et d’autres fournisseurs de soins de santé fait partie de notre promesse d’améliorer la qualité de vie de l’ensemble de la population albertaine, en particulier des personnes âgées et des plus vulnérables. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé

Des modifications seront apportées aux deux règlements d’application de la loi sur les maisons de soins infirmiers (Nursing Home Act) : le règlement général sur les maisons de soins infirmiers (Nursing Homes General Regulation) et le règlement sur le fonctionnement des maisons de soins infirmiers (Nursing Homes Operation Regulation).

« Les infirmiers praticiens et les infirmières praticiennes font partie intégrante du parcours du patient et jouent un rôle important dans la prestation des soins de santé à l’échelle de la province. L’Alberta Health Services (services de santé de l’Alberta) aide les infirmiers praticiens et les infirmières praticiennes au sein de son réseau à utiliser l’éventail complet de leurs compétences. Ce changement supprimera les obstacles législatifs et appuiera davantage la prestation de soins améliorés et accessibles aux résidents d’établissements de soins de longue durée. »
Dre Verna Yiu, présidente et directrice générale, Alberta Health Services


« Les infirmiers praticiens et les infirmières praticiennes sont des praticiens autonomes aux qualifications supérieures qui leur permettent de fournir des soins primaires indépendants en Alberta. Nous saluons les changements définitifs grâce auxquels les infirmiers praticiens et infirmières praticiennes sont en mesure d’utiliser l’ensemble de leurs compétences dans les maisons de soins infirmiers et nous sommes impatients de poursuivre notre collaboration avec le gouvernement pour aider ces soignants à utiliser toutes leurs compétences à l’échelle du système de santé de l’Alberta. »
Mary-Elizabeth Cooper, présidente, Nurse Practitioner Association of Alberta (association des infirmiers praticiens et infirmières praticiennes de l’Alberta)

Les résidents des maisons de soins infirmiers peuvent désormais se faire prescrire sur ordonnance les médicaments prévus à l’annexe 1 et obtenir des ordonnances de tests de diagnostic courants, comme les radiographies, les échographies et les tomodensitogrammes, directement auprès d’infirmiers praticiens et d’infirmières praticiennes et d’autres professionnels de la santé qualifiés, selon leur champ d’exercice et à la discrétion du technicien. Ces changements définitifs réduisent les formalités administratives et éliminent les chevauchements de tâches inutiles, tout en améliorant l’accès aux soins primaires pour les résidents des maisons de soins infirmiers.

If passed, the Real Estate Amendment Act, 2020, will restructure and refocus RECA with a mandate on licensing and regulating Alberta’s real estate sector. These amendments are a continuation of actions that began last fall to address severe problems with RECA’s governance.

“Eight months ago, I began the work of cleaning up a dysfunctional real estate regulator by firing the Real Estate Council of Alberta. Today, I’m pleased to be taking another important step by bringing forward reforms to increase transparency, ensure accountability, and improve the governance of RECA and to restore the trust of Albertans and the real estate industry in the regulator.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta


“Last fall, the Minister appointed me to oversee the functions of RECA and help restore regulatory oversight and prepare for transition to a new council. This is an exciting time for the industry as we see the Minister incorporate the feedback he received from the many industry stakeholders and implement a positive new beginning for RECA.”
Duane Monea, administrator, Real Estate Council of Alberta

The proposed changes will restructure RECA to consist of a board of directors, as well as four new industry councils: residential real estate agents and brokers; commercial real estate agents and brokers, and commercial property managers; mortgage brokers; and residential property managers and condominium managers.
These new industry councils will be responsible for identifying and addressing emerging issues related to their parts of the real estate sector, setting standards and rules, and determining licensing requirements. The RECA board will be responsible for oversight of RECA’s strategic direction and staff, and help to facilitate coordination between the industry councils.

“It has been key for us not just that we were included throughout the Minister’s consultation process, but also that commercial real estate agents/brokers and property managers will continue to have a seat at the table under the new structure. I’m confident that the new RECA will be on the right track going forward.”
Percy Woods, president and CEO, Building Owners and Managers Association – Edmonton


“REALTORS® are pleased the Alberta government has heard our concerns and is taking action to improve regulation of the real estate industry. This legislation demands greater openness and transparency, which will help rebuild eroded trust in the real estate regulator.”
Kristie Kruger, chair, Alberta Real Estate Association


“We’re pleased that the Minister has addressed our major concerns and specifically that mortgage brokers will finally be regulated by mortgage brokers when the new council is in place. We look forward to working closely with RECA as they transition to the new structure.”
Mary Swaffield, executive director, Alberta Mortgage Brokers Association


“The changes the Alberta government has made to the Real Estate Council of Alberta for more transparency include the regulation and licensing of condominium managers, while ongoing education will be addressed through the condominium industry. This separation will benefit Alberta’s condominium community by ensuring that condominium managers in Alberta receive supportive and specific educational opportunities that will further professionalize management services.”
Anand Sharma, president, Canadian Condominium Institute – North Alberta


“We have appreciated the opportunity to be involved in the conversation about improving RECA. While we as real estate appraisers will no longer be included under RECA’s oversight, we will continue to maintain strong consumer and marketplace protections via our existing system of self-regulation, professional standards and consumer protection.”
Terry Brooke, president, Appraisal Institute of Canada – Alberta

Other proposed amendments

Services beyond the scope of RECA’s newly focused mandate will be removed from RECA’s purview, including education, professional advice beyond regulatory information, promotion of the real estate industry, and setting of standards beyond the minimum for licensing and transactions.
Real estate appraisers will be removed from RECA oversight as they are self-regulated through their own industry associations.
New business and financial reporting requirements to improve RECA’s transparency and accountability to industry, government and the public.
Mandatory governance training and dispute resolution procedures for all board of directors and industry council members to improve the identification and resolution of issues.
Improved intervention measures that will give the minister the tools needed to ensure RECA meets its commitments and delivers its duties.
Condominium managers will be added to the groups overseen by RECA when the new industry council model comes into force.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The province has committed $9.4 million in additional funding for flood mitigation in Bragg Creek as part of the province’s pledge to provide adequate flood protection for communities upstream of the Springbank Reservoir. These projects are a component of the province’s overall flood mitigation strategy for southern Alberta. The Bragg Creek project is expected to create about 60 jobs during the construction phase.

“The recent flooding in northern Alberta has shown once again the devastating impact severe weather events can have on families, communities and the economy. That’s why it’s so important that we ensure high-priority flood mitigation projects are able to move forward, including the work planned for Bragg Creek.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks


“Rocky View County is grateful to the Province of Alberta for this continuing strong support for the people of Bragg Creek. This top-up funding will ensure the project is completed and protect the community from flooding and eliminate a recurrence of what has been experienced in the past. Thank you to the province and Minister Nixon for the ongoing support!”
Greg Boehlke, reeve, Rocky View County


“Bragg Creek was one of the most harmfully affected communities by the 2013 floods. Many of our homes and businesses have still not rebuilt to this day. This additional $9 million investment by our government for berms along the Elbow River is a step towards ensuring the community of Bragg Creek is protected against future unpredictable natural disasters.”
Miranda Rosin, MLA for Banff-Kananaskis

The province previously provided $27.2 million for flood protection for Bragg Creek. The additional $9.4 million will allow Rocky View County to increase the length of the flood barriers to nearly four kilometres, replace Bracken Road Bridge and stabilize an additional 475 metres of riverbank. The $42.2-million project also includes funding from the federal government.
Bragg Creek is located upstream of the site of the future Springbank Reservoir, therefore community-level protection is necessary to mitigate the risk of flooding in the community.
The Bragg Creek flood mitigation project is managed by Rocky View County. Construction is expected to begin this year and be complete in 2023.

Seed growers in Alberta will soon have access to more seed varieties and cereal research. Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Devin Dreeshen has signed a ministerial order removing Fusarium graminearum (fusarium) from the Pest and Nuisance Control Regulation, bringing Alberta in line with best practices from other provinces.
Fusarium is a fungal disease of cereal crops that affects grain development and quality. Removing it from the regulation will allow Alberta to modernize to managing the disease, rather than having zero tolerance for it.
Regulating fusarium has failed to stop its spread, which has increased across the province over the past 20 years. The Alberta Fusarium graminearum Management Plan, published in 2002, does not account for recent advances in seed treatment options that can lower detections, bringing them close to zero.

“Alberta’s farmers continue to grow high-quality food that people around the world can count on every day. This long-overdue change creates new opportunities for our farmers by levelling the playing field. Modernizing these rules means that Alberta farmers will benefit from current research advances.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


“This news has been a long time coming. Fusarium is well-established in Alberta and since it spreads through air-borne spores, we know that zero tolerance policies are not effective. We welcome this regulatory shift that better reflects the reality facing farmers and appreciate Minister Dreeshen’s dedication to breaking down this regulatory barrier so we can move ahead with improved competitiveness.”
Tood Hames, chair, Alberta Wheat Commission


“Alberta crops are known around the world, so we commend the Government of Alberta for ensuring that growers in the province and those who count on them can benefit from the latest scientific advances. We work every day towards greater food security in an environmentally sustainable way, and today’s decision is a key step in this shared goal.”
Paul Hoekstra, government and industry relations, Syngenta


“The Canadian Seed Trade Association has long advocated for a removal of fusarium as a pest as it will be the most effective way for industry to promote management systems; encourage research, investment and innovation; and allow Alberta farmers to stay competitive with their counterparts in other jurisdictions. We would like to thank the Government of Alberta for its leadership.”
Georges Chausse, president, Canadian Seed Trade Association

The Alberta Fusarium graminearum Management Plan will be updated and continue to be available for farmers and industry looking for information and best management practices. The Government of Alberta will continue education and awareness efforts.
This is another positive step forward in government’s commitment to reduce red tape and make life easier for all Albertans. To track red tape reduction progress and submit suggestions about where government can cut even more red tape, please visit CutRedTape.Alberta.ca.
Quick facts

Fusarium graminearum causes fusarium head blight, a serious fungal disease that affects wheat, barley, oats and corn.

	
It has been present in Alberta at very low levels since 1989. 
In late 2002, Alberta released the first comprehensive Alberta Fusarium graminearum Management Plan.

The Government of Alberta is establishing the Alberta Firearms Advisory Committee to provide recommendations on how Alberta can better assert areas of provincial jurisdiction while respecting law-abiding Albertans’ long history of responsible firearms ownership.  
To further improve firearms governance in Alberta and crack down on their illegal use, the government is also establishing a provincial firearms examination unit to speed up testing of guns that have been seized as evidence in criminal investigations.

“The federal government has introduced hasty and ill-thought-out measures that penalize law-abiding gun owners while doing little to stop criminals who traffic or use illegal firearms. The vast sums of money Ottawa will spend would be far better used to pursue the smugglers and drug gangs that plague our society. In Alberta, we will take action to protect Albertans, prosecute criminals and deter illegal gun crime and trafficking rather than persecuting law-abiding citizens.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“While Ottawa spends hundreds of millions of dollars targeting law-abiding gun owners, our government is investing in a firearms examination unit to conduct criminal firearms testing so prosecutions are not put in jeopardy by lengthy delays. The measures we are taking today will show Ottawa that a responsible firearms policy targets criminals and illegal gun traffickers and not lawful gun use.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General

Alberta Firearms Advisory Committee
The Alberta Firearms Advisory Committee will be chaired by Michaela Glasgo, MLA for Brooks-Medicine Hat, and will have representation from groups that speak for a wide range of lawful gun owners, including farmers and ranchers, hunters and trappers, and shooting sports enthusiasts.
The committee will give Albertans the opportunity to voice their concerns over the federal government’s firearms legislation and provide recommendations on how provincial policies can best target criminals while respecting law-abiding gun owners.

“We need firearms policies that recognize and support the ability of Albertans to own and possess firearms in a lawful and responsible manner. I am pleased to chair the Alberta Firearms Advisory Committee to ensure our government develops policies that reflect the values of Albertans.”
Michaela Glasgo, MLA for Brooks-Medicine Hat


“Community safety is a vital concern for all Albertans. It is critically important to protect our communities from the crime and violence associated with the unlawful possession and use of firearms while at the same time protecting the lawful rights of hunters and responsible gun owners.”
Rick Hanson, committee member and former chief, Calgary Police Service

Alberta Firearms Examination Unit
A legal requirement for prosecuting gun crimes involves proving that a seized weapon meets the Criminal Code definition of a firearm by having a barrel and the ability to fire a projectile capable of causing serious injury or death.
While the Calgary Police Service (CPS) carries out this testing in its own facility and the Edmonton Police Service (EPS) is establishing a lab of its own, most police services in Alberta rely on the RCMP’s National Forensic Laboratory Services in Ottawa to fulfil this requirement with a straightforward test-firing procedure.
In the fall of 2019, data indicated it was taking an average of eight months for the national RCMP laboratory to process a routine firearms testing request from Alberta.
To prevent lengthy court delays from putting the prosecution of violent criminals at risk, Alberta is ending its reliance on the federal laboratory by establishing a provincial unit to perform tests on firearms used in crimes.
Justice and Solicitor General is working on a plan with its partners at CPS, EPS, RCMP and Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams (ALERT) to establish a team and protocols for conducting firearms testing at the existing lab in Calgary and the forthcoming facility in Edmonton.

Bill 19, the Tobacco and Smoking Reduction Amendment Act, follows a review of the Tobacco and Smoking Reduction Act led by MLA Jeremy Nixon in response to the increase in vaping, smoking and tobacco use in Alberta. The review engaged almost 10,000 Albertans.
The review resulted in valuable recommendations to address the alarming rise in vaping among young Albertans. Currently, Alberta is the only province without vaping legislation. 

“This proposed legislation sends a strong message to youth, and anyone who thinks it is OK to supply them with vaping products – there will be fines for possession and consumption. Selling or giving these products to minors will have consequences. Reducing health harms by keeping vaping products out of the hands of youth is a priority for both me and this government, and it’s what Albertans asked us to do.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Evidence shows that vaping has immediate and long-term health risks, such as lung damage, nicotine poisoning and addiction. Albertans who smoke or vape also appear to be at higher risk of developing more severe symptoms if they contract COVID-19.

“Thank you to everyone who participated in our consultations, wrote in, or completed our survey. Your insights and solutions were truly inspiring. Bill 19 reflects the feedback we received and ensures that we are taking the right steps to protect our youth from both the known and yet-to-be-known harms of vaping.”
Jeremy Nixon, MLA for Calgary-Klein

The proposed act specifically addresses youth vaping, and would add enforceable restrictions on the possession, promotion, display, sale and use of these products, in alignment with tobacco laws. It would also include the expansion of smoke and vape-free areas, especially at places frequented by children and youth.
Along with individual harms, health costs for Alberta as a result of the use of tobacco products are estimated at $6 billion over the next four years.
Summary of proposed legislation

Minimum age for purchasing, possessing or using vaping products would align with tobacco products (18 years and older).
In convenience stores and gas stations, vaping displays, advertisements and promotion would need to align with tobacco restrictions.
Aligning places where vaping and tobacco products can not be used will reduce confusion for the public and law enforcement. New places where vaping and smoking will not be allowed include:
	
on hospital, school or child care properties
on playgrounds, sports or playing fields, skateboard or bicycle parks, public outdoor pools or splash pads, zoos and outdoor theatres


Restrictions on the locations of vaping product sales will align with tobacco restrictions, and include:
	
health facilities
public post-secondary institutions
stores where pharmacies are located
vending machines or temporary facilities


Alberta’s proposed legislation will establish the authority to consider restrictions on flavoured vape if it is not covered by potential federal legislation.


“We thank the Alberta government and the Minister of Health for introducing legislation to help curb the youth vaping epidemic. Effective vaping legislation will be aligned with existing tobacco legislation to the greatest extent possible in order to provide maximum protection for youth. The Tobacco and Smoking Reduction Act has contributed to achieving the lowest smoking rates among adults and youth on record in Alberta.""
Les Hagen, executive director, Action on Smoking & Health


“This legislation is long overdue and serves as an additional deterrent to limit young people’s access to harmful vaping products. School boards across Alberta welcome additional restrictions that will keep our children safer and healthier at school and in their communities.”
Lorrie Jess, president, Alberta School Boards’ Association


“As a municipality, it is helpful to know that we would be supported by provincial legislation in tackling these issues together. This legislation is effective in striking the balance between allowing adults the freedom to make their own decisions, and protecting consumers, residents and especially our children’s health. Thank you to MLA Jeremy Nixon for his engagement on this file, and thank you to the provincial government for taking decisive action to protect the health of Albertans.”
Peter Brown, mayor, City of Airdrie

Quick facts

Alberta’s Tobacco and Smoking Reduction Act review was led by MLA Jeremy Nixon from Oct. 25 to Dec 4.

	
About 250 people participated in 41 consultation sessions across Alberta, including health experts, municipalities, educators, enforcement, youth, businesses and industry.
More than 9,500 individuals responded to an online survey.
The review findings are summarized in a report.


Teen vaping rates (used in past 30 days) surged from eight per cent in 2014-15 to 22 per cent in 2016-17 and to 30 per cent in 2018-19 (Grades 10-12).
Recent vape-related lung illness and deaths in the U.S. and Canada highlight that other health impacts of vaping are yet to be determined.
Addiction to tobacco products is the leading cause of preventable illness, disability and death in Alberta and yet the prevalence of smoking in Alberta is second highest in Canada.
In 2018-19, 15.6 per cent of Albertans aged 18 or older indicated they smoked cigarettes daily or occasionally.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Alberta Education recently expanded its playground funding criteria to get more playgrounds built than would have otherwise. This funding comes from the existing capital budget and will support 18 school divisions in building the new playgrounds, supplementing their fundraising efforts.

“Our government is proud to support school divisions with this new funding – especially now. It is crucial, now more than ever, to help projects like these move ahead for schools and communities during these challenging times. Playgrounds are extremely important to local communities and provide a place for all children to explore, develop and have fun!”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

Alberta Education provides grant funding of up to $250,000 per school to support the construction of a playground for eligible projects. School communities that wish to exceed $250,000 can use fundraising to supplement the project.
The additional funding is intended to address playgrounds at schools that were replaced on the same site as their original building and new school projects announced between April and December 2013 where the playground has not yet been built.

“We are pleased to see this additional money for playgrounds not previously funded. ASCA members support government funding for playground facilities. Physical activity and social interaction are essential in student development and well-being. School councils often work with their parent fundraising associations for years before funding is obtained to complete playground projects that are fundamental to the school community.”
Brandi Rai, president, Alberta School Councils’ Association


“We are thrilled to hear the exciting and fantastic news that our school will be receiving $150,000 this summer to break ground on our long-awaited playground. We want to give a heartfelt thank you to the Alberta government and our MLA, Searle Turton, for their support of the students and staff at our school. Combined with our committee fundraising efforts, we are hoping to have a playground by the start of the school year. It is so exciting to have students, staff, parents, community and government come together to make this project a reality.”
Michelle Kincheloe, president, Prescott Learning Centre Fundraising Foundation

Grant funding remains available to those schools that have not received the Education playground grant to upgrade or replace an existing playground through the Community Facility Enhancement Program.
Moving forward, any new school with K-6 programming will have funding for a playground included in their capital budgets.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




If passed, Bill 18, the Corrections (Alberta Parole Board) Amendment Act, would create the Alberta Parole Board. A provincial parole board would better protect Albertans, their loved ones and their property from repeat offenders, including parolees. The government is fulfilling a commitment to Albertans to better hold criminals responsible to protect public safety.

“Albertans expect, and deserve, a faster, fairer and more responsive justice system that holds criminals responsible. Our government’s platform committed that we would ensure repeat offenders, including parolees, are not able to re-victimize them. This is an important part of getting a fair deal for Alberta, and of getting more Alberta and less Ottawa.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Our government has heard loud and clear that Albertans want us to do everything we can to protect them, keep our communities safe and prevent people from being victimized. By creating an Alberta Parole Board, Alberta is taking control of a key component of the administration of justice in this province. It will help end the ‘revolving door’ justice system and will be more in touch with the current realities facing law-abiding Albertans who are frustrated with a justice system that does not make them feel secure and protected.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


“RMA has consistently expressed concerns regarding the impacts that repeat offenders have on police services and the justice system in rural Alberta. The creation of the Alberta Parole Board is intended to offer solutions to the current ‘catch and release’ system, contributing to increased safety for our rural communities through responsive oversight.”
Al Kemmere, president, Rural Municipalities of Alberta

The Alberta Parole Board would determine parole or early release eligibility for those serving sentences in provincial correctional facilities, which are sentences less than two years. Currently, Alberta contracts with the federal government to have the Parole Board of Canada make these determinations.
The Alberta Parole Board would also supervise provincial parolees through:

Community probation officers, with localized knowledge and ties to the community in which they work, who will closely monitor offenders released on parole from provincial correctional facilities.
Provincial correctional centre caseworkers and probation officers who will continue to do much of the same work for the Alberta Parole Board that they already do for the federal parole board.

If passed, the government plans to have the Alberta Parole Board in place and operating starting Jan. 1, 2021.
Quick facts

The Government of Alberta will appoint Alberta Parole Board members for provincial parole decisions.
Alberta would be joining Ontario and Quebec, which have had their own provincial parole boards since 1978. As with the Alberta plan, their boards make parole decisions for applicants serving a sentence of less than two years in provincial correctional facilities.

“June is PTSD Awareness Month, a time to learn more about post-traumatic stress disorder and those who live with it. While PTSD is commonly thought to only affect military personnel, emergency personnel and rescue workers, it can affect anyone. It is important that we understand PTSD is treatable and recovery is possible.
“As Albertans continue to cope with life in a pandemic, those already struggling from PTSD may find that our current crisis is escalating their symptoms. Likewise, PTSD can manifest in people who have been severely affected by the pandemic.
“Alberta’s $53-million COVID-19 mental health action plan will support the mental wellness of all Albertans, including those with PTSD and those who may be at risk of developing PTSD. Our primary focus is to ensure Albertans have access to local community support for PTSD during, and after the pandemic. 
“To anyone who may be struggling with PTSD, please know that treatment is available, and recovery is possible. As a society we can come together to support recovery from PTSD, and create communities that foster long-term well-being. Albertans are here to support each other, especially in times of hardship.”

“June is ALS Awareness Month and I encourage Albertans to learn more about ALS and those who suffer from it. I also ask you to think about the caregivers, health-care professionals and researchers who play a vital role in the life of someone living with ALS.
“ALS has no known cause and there is no cure – but there is still hope. Through ongoing research, we continue to learn more about the disease, and with support from donors and fundraising initiatives, better treatments and an eventual cure are possible.
“I want to acknowledge the ALS Society of Alberta for the work it does to make life better for people living with ALS and their families, and for its ongoing efforts to help find a cure, including the annual Walk to End ALS. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s walk will happen virtually on ALS Global Awareness Day, June 21. I encourage you to visit the ALS Society’s website to learn how you can participate or donate.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) is calling for proposals for the challenge, which will accelerate innovation in support of long-term competitiveness and stimulate growth in the critically important agriculture, agri-food and forestry sectors.
Projects that result from this challenge will lead to job creation, attract local and international investments and open up new markets.
A total of $40 million will come from the TIER Fund—a key part of Alberta’s climate response, funded by industry—­to support the challenge. These investments will be used to aid recovery, strengthen existing industries and help create new opportunities from small and medium enterprises across these sectors.
The $40 million will help farmers, ranchers, industry, and innovators navigate the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing market implications. These innovations will lead to positive impacts, such as lower production and processing costs for food and fibre and natural solutions to remove carbon from the atmosphere.
The application deadline is Aug. 27, at 5 p.m. MT. Visit eralberta.ca for more information and eligibility criteria, or to sign up for an informational webinar to be held on June 29.

“Our government is proud to fund the Food, Farming, and Forestry Challenge. This is a strong example of how Alberta is thoughtfully advancing creative solutions to achieve both emissions reductions and greater economic and environmental resilience. Alberta has shown significant leadership in emissions reduction via enhancing agricultural and forestry practices and we look forward to continuing on this path through further market-based opportunities.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks


“Our foresters, farmers and ranchers have always been innovative in order to compete around the world. Investing in additional technological advancements will help them continue to grow and create more jobs in Alberta’s largest natural resource sectors.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


“Our mandate at ERA is to improve the cost and carbon competitiveness of all sectors. At this time of global uncertainty, we are taking bold action to accelerate technology-led innovation that ensures these key industries can grow sustainably.”
Steve MacDonald, CEO, Emissions Reduction Alberta


""ERA's funding support is essential in allowing companies like Al-Pac to de-risk complex projects. These innovative projects will make our companies more financially viable and reduce emissions, all the while bettering the environment for Albertans. There are a lot of great ideas out there, and without the support of ERA, they may not be realized.” 
Daryl Nichol, pulp mill manager, Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc.


“Now, more than ever, we need to take action to ensure a sustainable future for the 70 communities and thousands of Albertans who depend on forestry. Innovation is a key part of preparing for our future. This program will help support forestry jobs throughout Alberta.”
Fred Dzida, board chair, Alberta Forest Products Association


""Investment in innovation plays an important part in the continuation of stable, sustainable food production in Canada. The Food, Farming, and Forestry Challenge is a positive thing for Alberta's beef producers, while helping ensure Canadians have continued access to high-quality and nutritious products.""
Bob Lowe, president, Canadian Cattlemen's Association


“We need fresh ideas to support the increased economic contributions of Alberta's food and beverage processing industry to help further diversify the Alberta economy. This funding opportunity helps address urgent needs in response to current health and economic disruptions, and it also helps build the long-term competitive advantage of Alberta's food and beverage industry.”
Melody Pashko, general manager, Alberta Food Processors Association (AFPA)

Quick facts

TIER is an improved system to help energy-intensive facilities find innovative ways to reduce emissions and invest in clean technology to stay competitive and save money.
Facilities can pay into a TIER Fund, which is used for innovative and cleaner Alberta-based technologies like the Food, Farming and Forestry Challenge.
Alberta’s agricultural and forestry sectors are an important part of the economy.
Alberta produces more than 40 per cent of Canada’s total cattle inventory, 33 per cent of Canada’s wheat, 32 per cent of Canada’s canola and 50 per cent of its barley.
In 2018, the agriculture and forestry sectors employed more than 100,000 Albertans.
Alberta’s agri-food exports reached a record $11.6 billion in 2018, an increase of three per cent from 2017, and forest products exports reached $4.2 billion, up 20 per cent from 2016.
Innovative projects that come out of this challenge will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture and forestry sector.
Since 2009, Emissions Reduction Alberta has committed more than $534 million to 161 projects that are worth $4 billion and estimated to reduce emissions by nearly 33 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030.

Effective June 1, the government’s Residential Tenancy Dispute Resolution Service (RTDRS) will accept applications from mobile home site tenants and landlords for urgent issues related to site possession and termination of tenancy.

“Soon after the Mobile Home Sites Tenancies Amendment Act was tabled and Alberta was confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic, I recognized that the RTDRS was going to be an even more important service for landlords and tenants of mobile home sites as it relates to evictions and began work to prioritize this access for them. Doing so is another example of our government’s commitment to make life better for Albertans, which is even more important in these trying times.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta

Under the Mobile Home Sites Tenancies Amendment Act, mobile home site tenants and landlords can access the RTDRS – a faster, less formal and less expensive alternative to the court system that helps resolve tenancy disputes for Albertans renting residential properties.
Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance physical distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.
Quick facts

The RTDRS was launched in 2006 and now receives more than 11,000 applications annually.
Landlords and tenants can file applications for remedies of up to $50,000 through the RTDRS.
Priority is being given to applications for urgent mobile home site possession and termination of tenancy-related matters.
	
Non-urgent mobile home site applications, for example those related to damages and security deposits, will be received beginning in fall 2020.


Currently, urgent applications are being heard in 10 to 15 business days after filing, and non-urgent applications are heard in about 30 to 45 business days.
	
Timelines can change depending on the number and type of applications and the availability of hearing officers.


The RTDRS application fee is $75, while provincial court fees can range from $100 to $200.
The RTDRS application fee can be waived if it would cause financial hardship to the applicant.

The RTDRS is increasing its staff by four in response to increasing demand for the service.

“In June, Alberta joins the world in celebrating Pride Month. This is a time to recognize the triumphs and contributions of the LGBTQ2S+ community.
“Usually, Pride Month would be full of gatherings and events. However, with restrictions for physical distancing and mass gatherings, we will demonstrate our support and celebrate pride in different ways.
“We’re stronger together, so through June, consider how you can be a part of building a more welcoming, inclusive community. Be a good ally, speak out against discrimination, share support online, and show that our province is a safe place for all to live and love freely.”

Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine, a fait la déclaration suivante à l'occasion du Mois de la fierté LGBTQ2S+ :
« En juin, l'Alberta se joint au monde entier pour célébrer le Mois de la fierté. C'est le moment de reconnaître les triomphes et les contributions de la communauté LGBTQ2S+.
« Habituellement, le Mois de la fierté est rempli de rassemblements et d'événements. Cependant, avec des restrictions en matière d'éloignement physique et de rassemblements de masse, nous allons démontrer notre soutien et célébrer la fierté autrement.
« Nous sommes plus forts ensemble, alors pendant le mois de juin, réfléchissez à la manière dont vous pouvez participer à la construction d'une communauté plus accueillante et plus inclusive. Soyez un bon allié, exprimez-vous contre la discrimination, partagez votre soutien en ligne et montrez que notre province est un endroit sécuritaire où tous et toutes peuvent vivre et aimer en toute liberté. »

Information has been posted online to offer guidance on which sports are permitted, along with ways to limit risks.
Local restrictions may also be in place in addition to provincial public health orders.

Supporting Alberta businesses through relaunch

Stage one of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy is underway. The first stage of relaunch will be fully active in Calgary and Brooks on June 1, with day camps and places of worship resuming services (within guidelines).
The Alberta Biz Connect web page has health and safety guidelines for general workplaces, and sector-specific guidelines for those able to open in stage one of relaunch. Businesses are encouraged to check the page for new and updated guidance documents.

The 34th edition of Seniors’ Week runs June 1-7. We also celebrate Intergenerational Day on June 1, which promotes rich and sustainable connections between generations, and reduces ageism.
With some COVID-19 public health and safety measures still in place, traditional Seniors’ Week celebrations like large barbecues and teas are not possible. Seniors’ Week, which began in 1986, is still about taking the time, and finding ways, to honour and recognize seniors and their contributions to building Alberta.
On June 1, Seniors and Housing Minister Josephine Pon will officially declare Seniors’ Week. Prior to COVID?19, Minister Pon selected the Seniors Outreach Program Society in Three Hills to co-host the provincial launch of Seniors’ Week 2020. The Three Hills group will now host the Seniors’ Week 2021 provincial launch event.

“Even if we can’t celebrate in person, I know Albertans will recognize and celebrate Seniors’ Week and Intergenerational Day. Seniors have provided a lifetime of service and lived through hard times. They have much to share with us. Let’s recognize those contributions and find new ways in these challenging times to celebrate the seniors in our lives – and all seniors.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“The celebration of Seniors’ Week is a much-anticipated event in our community. Our organization has been awarded the honour of co-hosting Seniors’ Week 2021 with the Alberta government. The added highlight will be to have Minister Josephine Pon in attendance for the opening ceremonies. Our plans are well underway for the event and we are already looking forward to it.”
Rhoda Murray, chairperson, Seniors Outreach Program Society, Three Hills

Communities across Alberta have made official Seniors’ Week declarations and are offering tips for people:

Plan virtual intergenerational activities – such as dances, games, storytelling, interviews and family activities – and record them.
Host a virtual event by leveraging technology such as Zoom, FaceTime or Skype.
Send an old-fashioned letter or card.
Continue to check in with seniors who are isolated.
Offer to pick up groceries or run errands.
Recognize seniors on social media accounts.
Organize parades with people driving by seniors housing to wave.
When ordering a meal, order a second one, send it to a senior, and enjoy it together online.
Share what you’re doing for the seniors in your life using the #abseniors hashtag.

Businesses and locations can access a template on that web page to help them plan how to protect employees and patrons from infection.
Completion of this template is voluntary.

This funding is the first portion of the $53-million COVID-19 mental health action plan announced in April, aimed at helping Albertans access the resources they require, when and where they need them. Funding will enhance mental health and addiction supports, both online and in the community, through international, national and local organizations.

“Many Albertans have needed greater mental health and addiction recovery supports during the pandemic and will continue to need help once it’s over. This funding is giving more people free access to supports 24-7, and it’s enabling our government to work with our sector partners to develop other innovative supports. We are in this together and we will support Albertans every step of the way.”
Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Health and Addictions

Big White Wall is an online community where Albertans can communicate with peers dealing with similar issues and get support 24-7 from addiction and mental health counsellors.

“People come to Big White Wall for support with a wide range of mental health and well-being issues – from anxiety, depression, isolation and stress, to relationship problems and lifestyle challenges. The safety of members and clinical rigour is at the core of what we do and we have a network of trained professionals to provide 24-7 support for Albertans.”
Matt McEvoy, senior vice-president and general manager for North America, Big White Wall

Albertans will also have better access to supports closer to home through enhanced local resources. This includes online mental health education and support, guidance and brief interventions with a trained counsellor, and improved access to e-mental health treatment with professional support through the InnoWell platform.
InnoWell supports early identification, assessment, and access to a number of e-mental health tools and apps and will be implemented in 10 communities – rural, remote and urban – across Alberta. It will provide a critical missing piece to Alberta’s addiction and mental health service landscape, supporting youth recovery and ensuring clinicians can work with youth to plan care.
The expansion of and increased capacity for the Addiction and Mental Health Helplines and Alberta 211 came into effect on March 27, during the immediate crisis response phase of this funding.
Since then, the Addiction Helpline has responded to more than 1,000 calls and the Mental Health Helpline has responded to more than 3,400 calls. The Kids Help Phone has also experienced about a 50 per cent increase in demand for their texting service since the start of the pandemic, and in April, the Community and Social Services Helpline (Alberta 211) responded to more than 2,700 calls – more than 400 of which were specific to mental health and substance use disorder.

Un investissement de 21,6 millions de dollars permet d’accroître les ressources en ligne et les mesures de soutien virtuelles pour les Albertains et les Albertaines qui ont des problèmes de santé mentale et de toxicomanie en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19 et qui cherchent de l’aide.
Ce financement est la première partie du plan d’action pour la santé mentale en réponse à la COVID-19 de 53 millions de dollars qui a été annoncé en avril et qui vise à aider la population albertaine à accéder aux ressources dont elle a besoin, quand et où elle en a besoin. Le financement améliorera les mesures de soutien en santé mentale et en toxicomanie offertes en ligne et dans les collectivités par des organisations internationales, nationales et locales.

« De nombreux Albertains et Albertaines ont eu besoin de mesures de soutien accrues en santé mentale et en désintoxication pendant la pandémie, et ils continueront d’avoir besoin d’aide une fois que celle-ci sera terminée. Ce financement donne à plus de gens un accès gratuit à des mesures de soutien 24 heures sur 24, 7 jours sur 7, et il permet à notre gouvernement de travailler avec nos partenaires du secteur pour établir d’autres mesures de soutien novatrices. La situation actuelle nous concerne tous et toutes, et nous continuerons de soutenir la population albertaine tout au long de la reprise. »
Jason Luan, ministre associé de la Santé mentale et des dépendances

Big White Wall est une communauté en ligne qui permet aux Albertains et aux Albertaines de communiquer avec des pairs qui ont des problèmes similaires et d’obtenir du soutien 24 heures sur 24, 7 jours sur 7 auprès de conseillers en toxicomanie et en santé mentale.

« Les gens utilisent Big White Wall pour obtenir du soutien à l’égard d’un large éventail de questions de santé mentale et de bien-être, notamment l’anxiété, la dépression, l’isolement, le stress, les problèmes relationnels et les problèmes de mode de vie. La sécurité des membres et la rigueur clinique sont au cœur de nos activités, et nous avons un réseau de professionnels formés pour fournir du soutien 24 heures sur 24, 7 jours sur 7 aux Albertains et aux Albertaines. »
Matt McEvoy, vice-président principal et directeur général pour l’Amérique du Nord, Big White Wall

Les Albertains et les Albertaines auront également un meilleur accès à des mesures de soutien plus près de chez eux grâce à l’amélioration des ressources offertes à l’échelle locale. Cela comprend l’éducation et le soutien en santé mentale en ligne, les conseils et les brèves interventions d’un conseiller qualifié, et l’accès amélioré à des séances de traitement en santé mentale en ligne offertes par des professionnels au moyen de la plateforme InnoWell.
InnoWell facilite la détection précoce, l’évaluation et l’accès à un certain nombre d’outils électroniques et d’applications en santé mentale, et elle sera mise en œuvre dans dix collectivités – rurales, éloignées et urbaines – de l’Alberta. En favorisant le rétablissement des jeunes et en garantissant que les cliniciens pourront travailler avec eux pour planifier leurs soins, elle comblera un grand vide dans le domaine des services en santé mentale et en toxicomanie de l’Alberta.
Les services élargis et accrus de la ligne d’assistance en toxicomanie, de la ligne d’assistance en santé mentale et de la ligne Alberta 211 sont entrés en vigueur le 27 mars, au cours de la phase de réponse immédiate à la crise de ce financement.
Depuis, la ligne d’assistance en toxicomanie (Addiction Helpline; en anglais seulement) a reçu plus de 1 000 appels et la ligne d’assistance en santé mentale (Mental Health Helpline; en anglais seulement) a reçu plus de 3 400 appels. Le service Jeunesse, J’écoute a aussi connu une augmentation d’environ 50 % de la demande pour son service de messagerie texte depuis le début de la pandémie, et en avril, la ligne d’assistance du ministère des Services sociaux et communautaires (Alberta 211) (Community and Social Services Helpline (Alberta 211); en anglais seulement] a reçu plus de 2 700 appels, dont 400 portaient sur la santé mentale et les troubles liés à la consommation d’une substance.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




“May 30 marks the 90th anniversary of parliamentary assent to the Natural Resources Transfer Acts, legislation passed by the Governments of Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and enshrined in the Constitution Act, 1930, that finally transferred full control over natural resources from the federal government to the four Western provinces.
“This key feature of Canadian federalism, which all other provinces had been granted as a basic tenet of Confederation, had been denied to Manitoba when it became a province in 1870, and to Alberta and Saskatchewan when they attained provincehood in 1905. Control over resources in parts of B.C., known as the Railway Belt and Peace River Block, had also been withheld by Ottawa when B.C. became a province in 1871.
“The four western provinces had fought for decades to get the federal government to uphold the principle of provincial equality and transfer control over natural resources to their rightful owners under the Constitution. On the day Alberta Premier John Brownlee returned home to Edmonton with the fair deal he had won from Liberal Prime Minister Mackenzie King finally in hand, he was greeted by a jubilant crowd of 3,000 and a fireworks celebration. It was the single most important achievement of his tenure, and it set the stage for the development of Alberta’s energy industry and all the prosperity that has flowed from it since.
“The Natural Resources Transfer Acts should have been the last word on provincial control over resources, but in the years since Alberta has had to fend off repeated federal intrusions into our clear constitutional jurisdiction, particularly over energy development. In the 1980s then Premier Peter Lougheed successfully fought for even stronger Constitutional protections, yet today we and other western governments are in court once again, challenging the federal carbon tax and Bill C-69, the ‘no more pipelines bill,’ as violations of the Constitution and the spirit of the Natural Resources Transfer Act.
“As the Alberta Court of Appeal noted in its 2019 ruling against the federal carbon tax as a violation of provincial jurisdiction, the prairie provinces’ ownership of their natural resources was ‘a long time coming.’ Indeed it was, and we will never give up that right, or the fight to defend it in the name of the principle of provincial equality under the Constitution of Canada.”

“May 30 marks the day when we join others around the world to think about and raise support for the many Albertans and families who live with multiple sclerosis.
“Our province and country have among the highest rates of the autoimmune disease that attacks the protective covering of the brain and spinal cord, interrupting the nervous system – and the daily lives – of people with MS and their families and caregivers. Imagine losing your balance or experiencing numbness or tingling in your body. Imagine suffering memory loss, vision problems, extreme fatigue or depression, among many other symptoms.
“This year has been especially challenging, stressful and scary for all those with underlying health issues who may be at higher risk of serious illness as a result of COVID-19. Be assured that Albertans with MS will continue to have access to the medications used to manage this disease, even as these drugs are explored as possible treatment to this novel coronavirus.
“Together, we are all working to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and relaunch the economy, while continuing to provide the strong public health services people need and deserve, including those with chronic conditions and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.
“To Albertans with MS, we recognize your tremendous strength. We thank you, your families and the MS Society of Canada for advocating for your needs. Thank you for doing your part to flatten the curve by holding your annual MS bike tour and fundraiser virtually. We look forward to earlier and more accurate diagnoses, improved treatments and advancements in care that will create a brighter, stronger future for you and all Albertans living with MS.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The stand-alone facility will be built down the road from Hythe’s Pioneer Homes seniors lodge and will provide a range of health services based on the needs of residents as they age in their home community. The project is expected to create 40 construction jobs at its peak and spark the local economy as Alberta emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. About 75 full- and part-time staff are expected to work at the site when it opens.

“This is great news for the community of Hythe and the surrounding area. I’m very pleased to see construction start on a new continuing care facility that will mean seniors and others needing more health services as they age can stay in their community, surrounded by family and friends.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Until now, seniors living in the Pioneer Homes seniors lodge and others needing continuing care services often had to move to another community to get higher levels of health care and services.

“The community of Hythe has been waiting a long time for this project and I’m glad our government is bringing it to fruition. Now seniors and families in the area will be able to stay in their community and enjoy the familiarity of home with friends and family.”
Travis Toews, MLA for Grande Prairie-Wapiti


“Residents of Hythe and our surrounding communities have patiently waited and advocated for more continuing care spaces. I’m thrilled to see this project move forward. It is a much-needed investment into our community that will allow more of our parents, seniors and loved ones to age in place, while creating jobs when we need them most. Thank you to the government and – more importantly – thank you to the residents of Hythe and region for your patience and advocacy.”
Brian Peterson, mayor, Village of Hythe


“This new joint venture could not have happened without the collaboration of government, key partners and the local community. Looking ahead, the much-needed continuing care community in Hythe will provide immediate and long-term jobs, an economic boost to the community and new capacity for seniors in need of memory care in the Peace Region. For all of this, we are grateful.”
Dalvin Napen, chief administrative officer, Hythe Pioneer Homes

The government originally provided $3.9 million to Pioneer Homes in 2014-15 to build a 48-space continuing care facility attached to the seniors lodge. Construction began in 2016, but the project was paused in 2018 due to unexpected challenges, including bankruptcy of the main contractor, building design issues and weather damage.
Government is providing an additional $3.2 million to continue the development of a larger continuing care project, increasing the capacity beyond the original project scope by adding 27 more continuing care spaces to meet the future needs of Hythe and the surrounding area. Alberta Health Services has identified Hythe as a community that needs more spaces for seniors and persons with disabilities.
Demolition and site cleanup at the former construction site will begin this summer, depending on restrictions that remain in place as part of the province’s COVID-19 pandemic response. Residents of the Pioneer Homes seniors lodge will be able to remain in their home during the demolition.
Construction of the project should take about 17 months to complete and the facility is expected to open in late 2021.
Quick facts

The new facility will be built to accommodate Designated Supportive Living Level 4, Level 4-Dementia and long-term care spaces to support different levels of personal and health-care needs.
As of February 2020, Pioneer Homes has 11 people on a wait list for the existing seniors lodge facility.

In addition, Doug Sawyer, current interim chair and member since 2017, has been appointed chair.
The new Marketing Council members will bring experienced guidance and oversight to Alberta’s seven agricultural marketing boards and 13 commissions.
Established in 1965 by the Marketing of Agricultural Products Act (MAPA), the Marketing Council is a regulatory agency that oversees the governance and ongoing operation of Alberta’s marketing boards and commissions and administers the regulations under the MAPA.

“Alberta’s marketing boards and commissions are responsible for keeping one of Alberta’s most important industries alive. The new appointments are active, important voices for our province’s farmers and ranchers.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

Marketing Council appointments

Doug Sawyer, chair – A cow/calf producer with more than 30 years of experience on provincial and federal boards and committees.
Stanley Church, Q.C., vice-chair – A Calgary lawyer who has served on multiple boards and commissions, including the Calgary Stampede Chuckwagon Safety Commission.
Patricia Henderson – An experienced agriculture professional and currently a director with United Farmers of Alberta.
Julie Stitt – A value chain consultant with years of experience with many livestock organizations, including Genome Alberta.

Quick facts

MAPA enables producers of agricultural products in Alberta to organize under entities known as marketing boards and commissions (MBCs) which assist farmers with the production and marketing of their products.
In addition to helping MBCs function effectively and serve the collective interests of their respective agricultural industry, the public, and agricultural stakeholders, the Marketing Council advises the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry on matters relating to the establishment, operation and management of MBCs.
The Marketing Council is accountable for more than 70 regulations related to the production and marketing of over 20 agricultural commodities – more than half of Agriculture and Forestry’s total regulations.
Marketing Council members may serve as many as two terms of up to three years; the chair may serve up to two terms totalling not more than 10 years.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




A&W, McDonald’s Restaurants of Canada Ltd. and Tim Hortons are partnering with the Alberta government to distribute non-medical masks at no cost through their drive-thru locations across the province, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Distribution will start in early June.
Government is also working with municipalities, First Nations communities, Metis Settlements and local agencies to distribute the non-medical masks to those who need them, such as people who depend on public transit.
This initiative is part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely begin removing public health restrictions and reopen our economy. For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.

“I want to thank A&W, McDonald’s Canada, Tim Hortons, and all of the other organizations and municipalities that have come together to help us distribute millions of masks. The collective response from leaders in government, public, and private sectors has been overwhelming and I am incredibly grateful to everyone involved.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“A&W is very pleased to support the Government of Alberta with this great initiative. Our restaurants across the province have been quick to step up and help organize the distribution of masks, and are looking forward to welcoming Albertans at our drive-thrus.”
Susan Senecal, president and CEO, A&W Canada


“McDonald’s Canada, together with our franchisees, have been committed to helping our communities throughout this pandemic. We welcome this opportunity to use our drive-thru operations to assist the Alberta government, and do the right thing for Albertans when they need us most.”
Jeff Kroll, restaurant support officer and COVID Response lead, McDonald’s Canada


“Throughout the pandemic, the 1,500 Tim Hortons owners across Canada have been eagerly supporting their local communities and stepping up to answer calls for assistance. When we were asked by the Alberta government to help distribute masks through our drive-thrus we did not hesitate. We’re proud to have been asked to participate in this important program and do our part to help Alberta move forward on its relaunch strategy.”
Mike Hancock, chief operating officer, Tim Hortons

Quick facts

Masks are provided in packages of four.
Masks will be available at almost 600 restaurant partner locations across Alberta.
Masks will be available only at drive-thrus, and only while supplies last. No purchase is necessary.
About 95 per cent of Albertans are located within 10 kilometres of these drive-thrus.
Mask use is not mandatory; they are an option for situations where maintaining a physical distance of two metres is not possible.
The mask distribution program is intended to supplement an individual’s efforts to acquire non-medical masks. Albertans who wish to use non-medical masks are encouraged to purchase their own supply from local retailers in addition to using those provided by government.
Instructions for proper care and use of non-medical masks is available on alberta.ca/masks.

La distribution commencera dès le début de juin.
Le gouvernement travaille également avec les municipalités, les communautés autochtones, les établissements métis et les organismes locaux pour distribuer les masques non médicaux à ceux qui en ont besoin, tels que les utilisateurs de transports en commun.
Cette initiative s'inscrit dans le cadre de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta, qui vise à éliminer graduellement et en toute sécurité les restrictions en matière de santé publique, de même qu’à permettre la relance de notre économie. Pour de plus amples renseignements, consultez la Stratégie de relance de l’Alberta.

« Je tiens à remercier les restaurants A&W, McDonald's Canada et Tim Hortons, de même que tous les organismes et les municipalités qui se sont unis pour nous aider à distribuer des millions de masques. La réponse des dirigeants du gouvernement et de ceux des secteurs public et privé a été extraordinaire. Je suis infiniment reconnaissant envers toutes les personnes qui se sont investies dans le projet. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé


« A&W est très heureux de contribuer à cette grande initiative en collaboration avec le gouvernement de l'Alberta. Nos restaurants de toute la province se sont empressés d'aider à organiser la distribution des masques, et leur personnel a hâte d'accueillir les Albertains et les Albertaines à nos services à l’auto. »
Susan Senecal, présidente et chef de la direction, A&W Canada


« McDonald's Canada et ses franchisés se sont engagés à aider nos communautés tout au long de la pandémie. Nous sommes heureux de pouvoir utiliser nos services à l’auto pour appuyer le gouvernement de l'Alberta dans ses efforts et venir aussi en aide aux Albertains et aux Albertaines au moment où ils ont le plus besoin de nous. »
Jeff Kroll, chef du Soutien de l’entreprise et des mesures d’urgence visant la COVID, McDonald’s Canada


« Tout au long de la pandémie, les 1500 propriétaires de restaurants Tim Hortons du Canada ont soutenu avec enthousiasme leurs communautés locales en répondant aux appels à l'aide. Lorsque le gouvernement de l'Alberta nous a demandé d'aider à la distribution des masques dans nos services à l’auto, nous n'avons pas hésité. Nous sommes fiers qu'on nous ait demandé de participer à cet important programme et de faire notre part pour aider l'Alberta à mettre en œuvre sa stratégie de relance. »
Mike Hancock, chef des opérations, Tim Hortons

En bref 

Les masques sont distribués en paquets de quatre.
Les masques seront offerts dans près de 600 restaurants partenaires partout en Alberta.
Les masques ne seront offerts qu'aux services à l’auto de nos partenaires, jusqu'à épuisement des stocks. Aucun achat n'est nécessaire.
Environ 95 % des Albertains et des Albertaines résident dans un rayon de 10 kilomètres de ces restaurants et de leurs services à l’auto.
L'utilisation des masques n'est pas obligatoire; les gens peuvent les porter dans les situations où il ne leur est pas possible de maintenir une distance physique minimale de deux mètres.
Le programme de distribution de masques est destiné à compléter les démarches de ceux et celles qui désirent se procurer des masques non médicaux. En plus des masques distribués par le gouvernement, les Albertaines et les Albertains qui souhaitent porter des masques non médicaux peuvent s'approvisionner auprès de détaillants locaux.
Les consignes concernant l'entretien et l'utilisation des masques non médicaux sont décrites dans le site alberta.ca/masks (en anglais seulement).

A partnership with the Canada Revenue Agency means a streamlined application process that makes it easier for newly created corporations, non-profit organizations, partnerships and sole proprietorships to access services at different levels of government.

“We are cutting red tape and making it faster for businesses to set up shop in Alberta. The Common Business Number makes it easier for Alberta job creators to conduct business.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta

Corporations and non-profit organizations use their federal business number to access and register for federal programs, including tax account and payroll deduction programs, along with participating provincial programs, such as Alberta Corporate Registry. Before the Common Business Number program was launched, businesses looking to incorporate in Alberta had to apply separately for their federal business number directly from the CRA, using the same information required in a provincial application.

“This simpler process will be a welcome change for our job creators as we recover from COVID-19. Now, more than ever, it’s important we cut red tape and give our businesses a helping hand up.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction

One number for two levels of government
In addition to streamlining the incorporation application process, the federal business number enables Alberta businesses and non-profits to identify themselves by using one identifier, instead of different registration numbers.
Quick facts

The Common Business Number program in Alberta:
	
Streamlines the incorporation process for corporations and non-profit organizations.
Simplifies and speeds up interactions with government by providing corporations and non-profits with one easy method of identification.
Allows for information sharing between different levels of government.



Red tape reduction
This is another positive step forward in government’s commitment to reduce red tape and make life easier for all Albertans. To track red tape reduction progress and submit suggestions about where government can cut even more red tape, please visit CutRedTape.Alberta.ca. Albertans can also submit ideas about how to reduce red tape for small businesses reopening after COVID-19 restrictions at Alberta.ca/BizConnect.

Quick facts

The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.

If passed, the Victims of Crime (Strengthening Public Safety) Amendment Act, 2020 will expand the scope of the Victims of Crime Fund to include public safety initiatives that deter crime to prevent victimization while continuing to provide supports to victims of serious crimes. 
The expanded scope of the fund would help support preventative measures through the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams (ALERT), the Rural Alberta Provincial Integrated Defence (RAPID) Force, drug treatment courts and the hiring of more Crown prosecutors. More support means more resources to combat organized and serious crime such as illegal drug and gun trafficking and online child exploitation, help stop people stuck in the cycle of addiction-related crime from reoffending, and ensure we have enough Crown prosecutors to keep criminals off the streets so they can’t endanger Albertans in their communities.

“Our government has heard loud and clear from Albertans that they are frustrated with a justice system that does not make them feel safe, secure and protected in their communities. We are ensuring that we provide the system with the tools and resources it needs to prevent Albertans from being victimized, and provide victims with timely support and the assurance that the perpetrators of crime will be brought to justice.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General

To further improve supports for victims of crime, the government has established a working group co-chaired by Tracy Allard, MLA for Grande Prairie, and Angela Pitt, MLA for Airdrie, to review the financial benefits program and consult on the creation of a new victims assistance model that will be launched in 2021. The working group will work with stakeholders and other Albertans this year to get their input on a new model.

“Too often, we have heard that Albertans can’t access supports for victims and don’t have the proper assistance they need. Our working group is seeking feedback to ensure the Victims of Crime Fund has the best possible capability to support victims.” 
Tracy Allard, MLA for Grande Prairie


“Ensuring that victims of crime in Alberta have the support they need has been a long-standing issue in our province. I am happy to be part of the solution as co-chair of the Victims of Crime Working Group, and bring attention to public safety and crime prevention.”
Angela Pitt, MLA for Airdrie-East

In the interim, the bill proposes changes to focus on victims who have experienced severe crimes with an interim victims assistance program to provide new areas of support:

Helping victims with out-of-pocket expenses resulting from violent crime, such as emergency transportation or protective measures.
Speeding up access to counselling for victims of serious violent crime – including sexual assault – and families of homicide victims.
Providing court support to victims and witnesses.

Victims of crime can also still apply for:

Death benefits, which reimburses the families of homicide victims for funeral costs.
Supplemental benefits, which is a monthly payment to help victims with severe injuries that require them to be dependent on others for basic functions and daily activities.

Quick facts

A victim surcharge for provincial fines goes directly to the Victims of Crime Fund, which supports a provincewide network of victim service units and services. Effective April 1, the surcharge increased by five per cent to a total surcharge of 20 per cent, allowing government to increase funding for victim services and public safety initiatives from about $40 million to about $60 million a year.

Premier Jason Kenney and Education Minister Adriana LaGrange speak about the Choice in Education Act. | Le premier ministre Jason Kenney et la ministre de l'Éducation Adriana LaGrange s’expriment au sujet du projet de loi sur le choix en matière d'éducation.

If passed, the bill will amend the Education Act to affirm that parents have the right to choose the kind of education they feel is best for their children. It will strengthen Alberta’s successful history of education choice, including public and separate schools, Francophone schools, charter schools, independent schools, home education and early childhood education.

“We committed to Albertans that our government would introduce a Choice in Education Act to affirm that parents have the primary right to choose the education their children receive. Parents, not politicians, know what is best for their kids, and our government is committed to delivering an excellent, world-class education that will equip them for life.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Bill 15 also proposes enhancements to education choice. If passed, the Choice in Education Act will create more options for parents to deliver home education to their children, and will allow for the establishment of charter schools that expressly focus on vocation-based education.

“We are committed to offering a number of education options that allow parents to select the path they feel will best help their children reach their full potential. I am proud to say that Alberta is the leader in choice available to families, and provides parents with more opportunities for their children’s education than anywhere else in Canada.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

The proposed Choice in Education Act:

Amends the preamble of the Education Act to include recognition of Section 26.3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that “parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.”
Protects parental choice while ensuring a strong public education system by indicating support for all types of schooling.
Supports the creation of new charter schools, including vocation-focused charter schools.
Protects the status and funding of independent schools.
Provides new options for parents who choose to home-school their children.


“Alberta’s choice-based school system is recognized as being a world leader in providing high quality education. The Association of Independent Schools and Colleges in Alberta welcomes the introduction of the Choice in Education Act, which provides further legislative clarity and recognition of the diverse learning options within the system and affirms the integral role of parents as the primary decision makers in their children’s education.”
Simon Williams, president, Association of Independent Schools and Colleges in Alberta


“In these extraordinary times, this proposed legislation is yet another recognition of the integral contribution education makes to the health of Alberta. As promised, the proposed act is built with broad involvement, is based on a deep history of results, and calls all Albertans to engage fully in giving Alberta youth the strongest possible advantage.”
Ron Koper, chair, The Association of Alberta Public Charter Schools


“Parental choice being enshrined within the Education Act as promised, and home education being equally acknowledged as an option for families deciding which education model they feel best suits each individual child, is a welcome step forward. Expansion of delivery to include notification only, with no funding, has long been a goal of our organization and we are gratified to have been heard clearly by Minister LaGrange and her department, with action resulting in this important bill.”
Shawna Sundal, government liaison, Alberta Home Education Association

Alberta Education has also released a summary report of the Choice in Education survey, which reflects the responses from more than 50,000 Albertans who shared their views on education choice during a public survey that ran in late 2019.
If passed, Bill 15 will come into force on Sept. 1.

Le projet de loi 15 intitulé Le choix en matière d’éducation (Choice in Education Act) garantira que les Albertains et les Albertaines peuvent exercer des choix au sein de notre système scolaire solide et diversifié.
S'il est adopté, le projet de loi modifiera la Loi sur l'éducation (Education Act) afin de confirmer que les parents ont le droit de choisir le type d'éducation qu'ils estiment répondre le mieux aux besoins de leurs enfants. Ce projet de loi s’inscrit dans la foulée de la longue histoire de l'Alberta en matière de choix d'éducation, notamment les écoles publiques et séparées, les écoles francophones, les écoles à charte, les écoles indépendantes, l'éducation à domicile et l'éducation de la petite enfance.

« Nous nous sommes engagés envers les Albertains et les Albertaines à ce que notre gouvernement présente une loi sur le choix en matière d'éducation afin de confirmer que les parents ont, par priorité, le droit de choisir le type d'éducation que leurs enfants reçoivent. Ce sont les parents, et non les politiciens, qui savent ce qui convient le mieux à leurs enfants, et notre gouvernement s'est engagé à leur offrir une éducation de premier ordre qui leur donnera les moyens de réussir dans la vie. »
Jason Kenney, premier ministre

Le projet de loi 15 propose également d'améliorer les choix en matière d'éducation. S’il est adopté, le Choice in Education Act permettra d’élargir les possibilités pour les parents d’offrir l’enseignement à domicile à leurs enfants et de mettre sur pied des écoles à charte qui se concentrent expressément sur l'enseignement professionnel.

« Nous nous sommes engagés à offrir un certain nombre d'options en matière d'éducation qui permettent aux parents de choisir la voie qui, selon eux, aidera le mieux leurs enfants à réaliser tout leur potentiel. Je suis fière de dire que l'Alberta est cheffe de file en matière de choix offerts aux familles, et qu'elle fournit aux parents plus de possibilités d'éducation pour leurs enfants que n'importe où ailleurs au Canada. »
Adriana LaGrange, ministre de l'Éducation

Le projet de loi Choices in Education Act :

modifie le préambule de l’Education Act afin d'inclure la reconnaissance de la section 26.3 de la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme, qui stipule que « Les parents ont, par priorité, le droit de choisir le genre d'éducation à donner à leurs enfants. »
protège le choix des parents tout en garantissant la solidité d’un système d'éducation publique et en signifiant son soutien à tous les modes de scolarité.
appuie la création de nouvelles écoles à charte, y compris des écoles à charte à vocation professionnelle.
protège le statut et le financement des écoles indépendantes.
offre de nouvelles options aux parents qui choisissent d’enseigner à leurs enfants à domicile.


« Le système scolaire albertain, qui est fondé sur le choix, est reconnu comme un chef de file mondial en matière d'éducation de haute qualité. L'Association of Independent Schools and Colleges in Alberta se réjouit de l'introduction du Choices in Education Act, qui apporte davantage de clarté et de reconnaissance en matière législative des diverses options d'apprentissage au sein du système et confirme le rôle intégral des parents en tant que principaux décideurs de l'éducation de leurs enfants. »
Simon Williams, président de l’Association of Independent Schools and Colleges in Alberta


« En cette période exceptionnelle, ce projet de loi souligne de nouveau la contribution essentielle de l'éducation à la santé de l'Alberta. Tel que promis, le projet de loi suppose une large participation, est basé sur une longue histoire de résultats solides et invite tous les Albertains et Albertaines à s'engager pleinement à donner aux jeunes de l'Alberta le plus grand avantage possible. »
Ron Koper, président de l'Association of Alberta Public Charter Schools


« Nous nous réjouissons que, tel que promis, le choix des parents soit enchâssé dans l’Education Act et que l'éducation à domicile soit également reconnue comme une option pour les familles alors qu’elles cherchent à choisir le modèle d'éducation qui est le mieux adapté à chacun de leurs enfants. Notre organisation a longtemps cherché à obtenir l’expansion de l’enseignement à domicile qui s’accompagne seulement un avis, sans financement, et nous sommes heureux que la ministre LaGrange et son ministère nous aient clairement entendus et aient agi en élaborant cet important projet de loi ».
Shawna Sundal, liaison gouvernementale d’Alberta Home Education Association

Le ministère de l'Éducation de l'Alberta a également publié un sommaire reflétant les réponses de plus de 50 000 Albertains et Albertaines qui ont fait part de leur opinion sur le choix en matière d'éducation lors d'une enquête publique menée à la fin de 2019.
S'il est adopté, le projet de loi 15 entrera en vigueur le 1er septembre.

Home-based businesses will not require food-handling permits or be subject to inspections for foods that present a low risk for food-borne illness. Low-risk foods do not require refrigeration and include such items as baked goods, jams/jellies, candies, pickled foods and cereals. High-risk foods and foods containing meat, poultry, seafood and/or raw milk will continue to be prohibited.

“This regulatory change maintains our standards for food safety, supports Alberta entrepreneurs, adds new jobs and benefits the economy by giving Albertans new opportunities to buy locally produced foods. It also makes it easier than ever to turn your passion into a home business.” 
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Home-prepared foods, including those sold at farmers markets, will need to be clearly and appropriately labelled so consumers can make informed choices. Vendors at farmers markets selling home-prepared foods will be asked to comply with the new labelling requirements, in addition to existing farmers markets guidelines. Implementation of these requirements will take place gradually, starting with education.

“More and more, Albertans are looking to buy local. Removing restrictions so Albertans can make low-risk foods in their home kitchens to sell to the public is a practical way to cut red tape and support home businesses while increasing Albertans’ access to local food.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction

Albertans wanting to prepare and sell high-risk home-prepared foods will still be required to have the appropriate food-handling permits and be subject to inspections.
More information on low-risk home-prepared food is available online.
Quick facts

In Alberta in 2016, food purchased at farmers markets reached an estimated value of $924.5 million, a 27.7 per cent increase over purchases made in 2012.

178,2020-05-27 15:00:00,Canada,Alberta,,https://www.alberta.ca/announcements.cfm?xID=714526C68FD23-0596-155D-3F643CFC982ACA4F,Government Website,Act holds AER accountable for timely application reviews,"


Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Bill 7, the Responsible Energy Development Amendment Act, directly addresses concerns about unnecessary delays – as a result of needless red tape and ineffective processes – in the Alberta Energy Regulator’s (AER) assessment of resource project applications. The regulator’s obligation to fully consider social and economic effects and the effects of an activity on the environment and landowners is unchanged. The legislation provides government with the backstop authority to establish maximum timelines for the AER to review applications if the regulator fails to do so. This will enhance predictability in all aspects of the review process – for industry and all Albertans.
Bill 7 builds on other recent actions to improve the performance of the AER, including the appointment of a new board and new chief executive officer. While government is encouraged AER’s new leadership team continues to take steps to address existing concerns around unnecessary processes and delays, this legislation provides Albertans further assurance regulatory certainty and predictability will no longer be compromised.

“We’ve heard, loudly and clearly, a regulatory system that provides certainty is the key driver to ensure needed capital investment flows into the province. We’re not asking the regulator to say yes or no to any project, but rather to ensure delays and uncertainty do not dissuade projects – that will help put Albertans to work – from being brought forward for review. Since being elected, we have taken a series of steps to strengthen and modernize the AER, helping to set a course for economic recovery by increasing investor confidence in Alberta’s energy sector.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy


“We made a commitment to Albertans that we would review and restructure the AER in order to ensure we are able to create certainty for the province’s job creators while maintaining our commitment to excellence in terms of environmental outcomes. This legislation will harmonize government and AER policies, allowing the regulator to approve or reject projects more quickly using its already stringent standards.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks


“The Canadian Energy Pipeline Association welcomes the Government of Alberta’s commitment to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of energy project application reviews. For Alberta to remain competitive, regulatory certainty and predictability are critical, especially as our province emerges from a period of prolonged economic uncertainty. We commend the government on its support for the energy sector, while ensuring our resources are produced and transported using world-leading safety and environmental standards.”
Chris Bloomer, president and CEO, Canadian Energy Pipeline Association


“PSAC appreciates the efforts of the Alberta government to restore investor confidence and operator efficiency in our energy sector by ensuring timely decision-making and reducing red tape for projects. Providing predictably for industry and certainty to attract capital investment for the responsible development of our natural resources will lead to jobs for the oilfield services sector that PSAC represents and benefits to all Albertans.”
Elizabeth Aquin, interim president and CEO, Petroleum Services Association of Canada

Government has also directed the regulator to establish a red tape reduction task force to identify unnecessary regulator processes.
Government continues to work with the AER to address long-standing liability and environmental concerns, such as strengthening the role of the Orphan Well Association, and developing a new suite of policies – to be announced in the near future – to ensure industry can cover the cost of cleaning up oil and gas wells and sites in a manageable way.
Quick facts

On Sept. 6, the Government of Alberta initiated a review of the Alberta Energy Regulator and appointed an interim board of directors.
The interim board of directors, consisting of public servants and individuals with oil and gas expertise:
	
Provided direction on restructuring.
Reviewed the industry levy that funds the AER.
Increased clarity regarding the AER’s role in providing proper oversight.


On April 1, government announced the appointment of a new AER board of directors.
On March 26, the AER appointed a permanent CEO.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Alberta Environment and Parks will mirror this approach.
The fire advisory will now allow residents of the Forest Protection Area and those recreating in the FPA to safely enjoy a backyard fire pit, the use of charcoal briquettes on a barbecue or a campfire.
Fire permits can be issued under a fire advisory, but some permits may be restricted for wildfire prevention purposes.
The advisory is in place to continue helping reduce the number of human-caused wildfires and help firefighters focus on existing wildfires during this time. Alberta Wildfire has already successfully extinguished 243 wildfires this spring.
Conditions are re-evaluated daily and adjustments to restrictions will be considered, on an area-by-area basis, as necessary throughout the wildfire season.
Increasing campfire safety
Recreationists are encouraged to use designated camp rings or fire pits while having a campfire. These are meant to keep fires from spreading and are the best choice for a safe campfire.
Water should be kept nearby to keep campfires under control and to fully extinguish them once finished. Campfires must be attended at all times until extinguished.
When extinguishing a campfire, remember to soak it, stir it and soak it again. A campfire is only out when it is cool to the touch.
Quick facts

Fire bans, fire restrictions, OHV restrictions and fire advisories have proven to be effective prevention tools in reducing the number of human-caused wildfires.
A fire ban prohibits all outdoor wood fires, including charcoal barbecues and backyard fire pits. Fire permits are generally not issued and are limited to essential burning.
A fire restriction allows safe campfires on private lands and in campgrounds but prohibits outdoor wood campfires on public lands including random and backcountry sites. Fire permits are limited to essential burning only.
A fire advisory allows for safe campfires on private and public lands, including campgrounds.  There may be restrictions on fire permits at the discretion of a forest officer.
The full list of approved activities can be found on the Alberta Wildfire website.
An off-highway vehicle restriction was introduced on May 7, 2020 in several areas in the northwest of the province and removed on May 21, 2020.
Since March 1, 2020, Alberta has recorded 243 wildfires in the Forest Protection Area of Alberta that have burned approximately 430 hectares (1,060 acres).
The five-year average (2015-2019) for this time of year is 528 wildfires that burned approximately 145,000 hectares (357,605 acres).
The fire danger rating is currently low to moderate across the province.
For more information on wildfires, download the Alberta Wildfire app.
Up-to-date information on fire restrictions, fire bans, OHV restrictions and general wildfire information is available at albertafirebans.ca or by calling 1-866-FYI-FIRE (1-866-394-3473).

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Alberta has expanded the hairstylist apprenticeship program to include barber certification, enabling apprentices to choose the path that best meets their needs.
The new barber certification path enables apprentices to streamline their training and achieve certification in half the time. Hairstylist apprentices wishing to switch programs or who are currently working as a barber can receive credit for training they have already completed.

“As we work to safely and gradually reopen businesses, it’s critical that we connect people to jobs. These changes will help Albertans quickly train for a rewarding career, and support our barbers as they get back to work. These changes also align with Alberta’s Skills for Jobs agenda to recognize the value of skilled trades education and encourage more Albertans to pursue rewarding careers in the trades to meet labour market demands.”

Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education



“When there is an opportunity to remove red tape, it is always welcome news. This streamline in training will encourage more Albertans to pursue a rewarding career in the trades and help get people back to work sooner.”
Jackie Armstrong-Homeniuk, MLA for Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville, and chair, Skilled Trades Caucus


“We are very excited about the improvements and recognition the industry is receiving from the Government of Alberta. These changes mean students can receive specialized training and expand their employment opportunities within our industry sooner. This new apprenticeship path provides Albertans with a chance to broaden their skill set and find stable employment in an industry that is resilient to economic downturns.”
Moe Sweiss, executive director, Canada School of Barbering


“The new barber certification program is a great opportunity for men and women across Alberta to become part of an amazing industry that is always evolving, as well as recession-proof. Students will be taught essential skills, then have opportunities to sharpen their talents, staying on the cutting edge throughout their career. In just one short year, anyone can gain the knowledge and training to become a certified barber. Those skills will last a lifetime.”
Jeni Ezeala, red seal hairstylist, and member, Hairstyle Provincial Apprenticeship Committee

Quick facts

Previously, barbers would need to complete the full two-year hairstyling apprenticeship program in order to earn a credential.
The scope of work for barber certification includes cutting, shaving, and trimming of hair on the face, nape and head, as well as providing recommendations for scalp care.
The new barber program is a 12-month term, with 10 weeks of classroom instruction and 1,450 hours of on-the-job learning.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Last week, Government House Leader Jason Nixon asked Speaker Nathan Cooper to recall MLAs to the chamber and a 2020 spring sitting calendar was drawn up for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“With more Albertans heading back to work, it is only fair the province’s policy-makers convene in Edmonton to debate legislation critical to getting the province back on track after a protracted commodities price war and COVID-19. We are resilient people, but the need for government to be laser-focused on job creation, creating certainty for industry and protecting vulnerable Albertans has never been more acute. These will be our main goals as we ease into relaunching the province.”
Jason Nixon, Government House Leader

At least 10 pieces of legislation will be introduced this session, including affirming parental rights to make important choices about their children’s education, strengthening public safety and cutting red tape. Government looks forward to continuing to fulfil its promises to Albertans, building on the 56 per cent of commitments from the election either fulfilled or underway.  
MLAs will continue to practise physical distancing while in the chamber, where possible, and every effort will be made to ensure limited contact between members, media and legislature staff in order to keep everyone safe and healthy. In returning to more normal operations of the legislature, we will ensure democratic accountability while making every effort to reduce contact between members.
Editor's note: Start of session date has been correct from the previous version.

Update on PPE for non-AHS services

With the PPE supply chain improving and with more companies now developing PPE, Alberta businesses have more options to source their own PPE. As a result, the Alberta government is focusing the supply of critical PPE to organizations that are at the highest risk of exposure to COVID-19. This includes hospital workers, first responders, and those working in publicly funded or contracted homeless shelters, seniors care facilities, and disability agencies.
As of July 1, businesses and non-AHS organizations will be required to access PPE directly through suppliers.
Groups that have already received or submitted a request for PPE from the Provincial Operations Centre or Alberta Health Services can continue accessing supplies, subject to availability and for a fee, from May 25 until June 30. Requests received and being fulfilled may be subject to fees.
	
This timing will help support these groups as they transition to other PPE suppliers.
For more information, visit the Alberta Emergency Management Agency web page.

The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes washing your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.


Anyone showing symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. To access testing, complete the COVID-19 self-assessment online.

Tenants and landlords can fill out a survey via alberta.ca to help gauge any challenges they may be experiencing while working together to develop a payment schedule, paying their rent, or meeting other financial obligations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Survey results will give government further insight into the types of issues businesses and landlords are experiencing and whether they have been able to access available supports. These insights will aid in determining whether additional measures are needed to support businesses struggling to pay rent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We expect businesses and landlords to work together in a respectful and fair manner during this challenging time. We strongly encourage landlords to participate in the CECRA program and to be flexible and understanding of their tenants’ financial circumstances. We are asking businesses to pay their rent as fully and consistently as possible, if they can. This isn’t an easy time for anyone – but by working together, we will get through these tough times.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism

The online survey, including alternative methods of submitting feedback by email or phone, can be found on the Commercial tenancy support feedback page.
Alberta has also joined other provinces, the territories and federal government in a program to help small businesses pay rent. The Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program will help give certainty to small businesses and relieve some of the financial stress businesses are facing. The program began accepting applications on May 25 and is administered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance physical distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.
Quick facts

Many businesses have experienced a dramatic decrease in revenues, while other businesses have temporarily ceased operations as a result of COVID-19.
Rent and labour are two of the largest expenses for small businesses, typically accounting for 50 to 60 per cent of total operating expenses.
In 2016, Alberta businesses paid an average monthly rent of almost $650 million.

Le gouvernement de l’Alberta est à l’écoute des entrepreneurs et des propriétaires pour s’assurer qu’il fait tout son possible pour que les entreprises restent ouvertes et que les Albertains et les Albertaines puissent continuer de travailler.
Les locataires et les propriétaires peuvent remplir un sondage en ligne sur le site alberta.ca (en anglais seulement) pour aider le gouvernement à évaluer les difficultés qu’ils pourraient rencontrer en travaillant ensemble à l’établissement d’un calendrier de paiement, au paiement de leur loyer ou au respect d’autres obligations financières pendant la pandémie de COVID-19.
Les résultats du sondage permettront au gouvernement de mieux comprendre les types de problèmes rencontrés par les entreprises et les propriétaires et de savoir s’ils ont pu accéder aux mesures d’appui offertes. Ces renseignements permettront de déterminer si des mesures supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour soutenir les entreprises qui ont du mal à payer leur loyer pendant la pandémie de COVID-19.

« Nous attendons des entreprises et des propriétaires qu’ils travaillent ensemble de manière respectueuse et équitable pendant cette période difficile. Nous encourageons vivement les propriétaires à participer au programme de l’Aide d’urgence du Canada pour le loyer commercial et à faire preuve de souplesse et de compréhension à l’égard de la situation financière de leurs locataires. Nous demandons aux entreprises de payer leur loyer aussi complètement et régulièrement que possible, si elles le peuvent. Ce n’est pas une période facile pour quiconque, mais en travaillant ensemble, nous surmonterons ces moments difficiles. »
Tanya Fir, ministre du Développement économique, du Commerce et du Tourisme

Le sondage en ligne, y compris les autres méthodes de soumission des commentaires par courrier électronique ou par téléphone, se trouve sur la page Commercial tenancy support feedback  (commentaires sur le soutien à la tenance commerciale; en anglais seulement).
L’Alberta participe également avec d’autres provinces et territoires ainsi qu’avec le gouvernement fédéral à un programme qui vise à aider les petites entreprises à payer leur loyer. Le programme d’Aide d’urgence du Canada pour le loyer commercial contribuera à offrir des garanties aux petites entreprises et à soulager certaines des difficultés financières auxquelles elles sont confrontées. Le programme a commencé à accepter les demandes le 25 mai et est administré par la Société canadienne d’hypothèques et de logement.
L’Alberta a adopté une réponse globale à la COVID-19 (en anglais seulement), notamment des mesures visant à renforcer l’éloignement physique, le dépistage et les tests. De plus, les aides financières aident les familles et les entreprises de l’Alberta.
En bref

De nombreuses entreprises ont connu une baisse spectaculaire de leurs revenus, tandis que d’autres ont temporairement cessé leurs activités en raison de la COVID-19.
Le loyer et la main-d’œuvre sont deux des dépenses les plus importantes pour les petites entreprises; elles représentent généralement entre 50 % et 60 % de leurs dépenses d’exploitation totales.
En 2016, le loyer moyen défrayé par l’ensemble des entreprises albertaines s’élevait à près de 650 millions de dollars par mois.

The government is providing $26 million to support 82 new capital maintenance and renewal projects for seniors housing facilities. These projects, taking place in communities across the province, will focus on the health and safety of residents, help keep units open and contribute to the government’s ring of defence around seniors.

“By injecting additional funding into capital maintenance and renewal projects, our government is stimulating the economy and getting Albertans back to work while ensuring seniors in need have access to a safe and secure place to call home.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing

Funding will finance renovations and emergency repairs to facilities. Projects include replacing or repairing boilers, elevators, HVAC units, electrical and safety systems, siding, windows, roofing and more.
To ensure current residents stay safe, the maintenance and renewal work will focus on building exteriors, unoccupied suites and low-traffic areas.
This initiative is part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely begin removing public health restrictions and reopen our economy. For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.
Quick facts

In response to the COVID-19 economic downturn, the Alberta government is doubling its capital maintenance and renewal (CMR) funding in 2020-21 from $937 million to $1.9 billion by accelerating the Capital Plan.

“Health-care providers make untold contributions to enhance the quality of life in rural Alberta. They live in their communities, are active in their communities and care about their communities. They choose to serve in rural communities for the quality of life it provides and for the meaningful relationships they are able to build by working in smaller centres.
“Our health-care providers deliver outstanding patient care regardless of where they work in the province. We want to thank them for their expertise and commitment to keeping Albertans healthy, especially during these unprecedented times as they battle COVID-19 on the front lines.
“During this special week, we also recognize local community volunteers who help keep health care close to home by supporting health-care initiatives and health-care providers in their communities. These volunteers go the extra mile by giving their time, extending kindness and sharing a personal connection that means so much.
“On behalf of all Albertans, we celebrate and thank health-care providers in our rural communities for all they do. They are valued and appreciated. Happy Alberta Rural Health Week.”

“Alberta’s tourism industry, and the innovative tourism businesses behind it, play a valuable role in driving our economy forward.
“Every year, Alberta’s iconic landscapes, destinations and experiences draw millions of visitors who spend billions in our communities, and support thousands of full-time jobs that Alberta families depend on. In 2017, the industry employed almost 73,000 Albertans and visitors spent almost $9 billion in our province.
“Alberta’s tourism industry has been faced with unprecedented challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our tourism industry was one of the industries hit first, and hit hardest, and we recognize there will be more challenges to overcome in the months and year ahead.
“That’s why we are working to do all we can to provide relief now so that we can move through the phases of relaunch, and pave a path to recovery.
“Leaders in Alberta’s tourism industry exemplify the determination, optimism and ingenuity that defines Albertans. They are trailblazers and they are committed partners, job creators, and pillars of our communities. They work hard, and our government is committed to working just as hard to support them.
“We will continue to move forward with plans to help Alberta’s tourism industry recover and grow by responding and providing immediate relief, relaunching and supporting the sector through recovery, and rebuilding and positioning the sector for long-term growth through our ongoing work with Travel Alberta on a 10-year tourism strategy.
“Our province has so much to offer. This week, I encourage Albertans to safely and responsibly go out to support your local businesses and explore the unique attractions and landscapes in your communities.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The 2019 growing season was challenging for producers, with poor harvest weather and early snowfall, resulting in more than one million insured acres remaining in the field over the winter.

“Farmers in Alberta have just gone through one of the toughest harvests in recent memory and now face the many repercussions of COVID-19. We are working with AFSC to simplify their operations to be more efficient at processing claims while also improving service standards and responsiveness for farmers and ranchers.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

AFSC adjusters have committed to settling outstanding cases quickly so that farmers can move on with seeding. As of May 20, adjusters have completed nearly all of the outstanding inspections – only about 130 inspections remain and are currently in progress. New wildlife claims continue to come in, and AFSC is responding quickly. 
AFSC made a number of operational changes, including increasing the number of claims verified remotely using yield volume and quality data compared with supporting weather data without on-site inspection.

“Our adjusters have been working hard, and we’ve geographically moved them to meet peak needs. We’ve assigned the majority of cases received to our adjusters and the bulk of outstanding inspections and wildlife claims were completed the first week of May.”
Jerry Bouma, interim chief executive officer, AFSC

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted how AFSC approaches day-to-day operations, staff are available by phone or email to help producers arrange inspections, purchase insurance, enrol in AgriStability, request a loan or answer questions. Branch offices remain open but have restricted public access.
AFSC serves the Alberta agricultural community, and their programs and services are available to help clients get ready for the growing season.
For more information on Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely begin removing public health restrictions and reopen our economy, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy. Financial supports are also in place to help Alberta families and businesses.
Quick facts

Producers with unharvested acres should contact their local AFSC branch office.
AFSC extended the period of insurance to offer producers continued coverage on their insured unharvested crops until harvest can be completed this spring.
Snowed-under crops that are harvested in the spring can usually still be sold or fed at a discounted price, and this is taken into account when crop insurance claims are settled.
AFSC claims adjusters contact clients who will be baling their unharvested crop, have filed a pre-harvest inspection request or wildlife inspection request. Depending on the situation, AFSC may be able to finalize the claim without a physical inspection.

About 27,000 residents and 44,000 staff in long-term care and level 4 designated supportive living facilities – those providing a higher level of support to people with more complex needs – can now be tested for COVID-19, if they choose, even if they have no symptoms. More testing for this most vulnerable population group will improve our ability to detect cases early, prevent possible outbreaks and keep people safe.
As Calgary sets to reopen more businesses as part of stage one of Alberta’s relaunch strategy, AHS will add an extension to the online self-assessment tool for the Calgary region, effective May 25. Symptomatic individuals within the zone will be able to book their own testing appointment if they live within 50 kilometres of an assessment centre and if the self-assessment tool indicates a test is required.
This additional feature will make it easier for people to schedule a COVID-19 test at a time and location that is convenient for them. This expansion will also provide public health officials with quicker access to testing information as we move forward through relaunch. 
Non-urgent surgeries will expand to include more day surgeries and those requiring an overnight stay. These surgeries were put on hold to make sure the health-care system had capacity to help those affected by COVID-19. Albertans waiting the longest will receive care first. Patients will be contacted directly when it is time for their surgery.
Since day surgeries resumed on May 4, about 3,000 scheduled surgeries have been performed across the province. Urgent and emergency surgeries have been available throughout the pandemic.

“Albertans have done a great job of flattening the curve of COVID-19 infections and reducing the risk to the dedicated women and men working in our hospitals. As a result, we can safely resume providing more of the scheduled care Albertans need. I know the deferral of scheduled services has been hard on patients and families, but it was the right thing to do as part of our overall strategy to protect Albertans from the impact of the pandemic.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Starting June 3, maternity services will again be offered at Calgary’s South Health Campus and the High River Hospital. Families had been accessing these services in nearby facilities. Services were consolidated on April 21 to make sure the region had space and resources to handle COVID-19.

“Patient safety is our top priority. We are extremely grateful to women and families for their patience during the temporary suspension of maternity services in south Calgary and High River. I want to assure families that hospitals remain a safe place for expectant mothers to deliver, and for mothers and newborns to receive care during the pandemic.”
Dr. Verna Yiu, president and chief executive officer, Alberta Health Services

Quick facts

Long-term care has the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 in all congregate (group) living settings in Alberta.
Up to an estimated 53,500 voluntary tests will be performed on residents and staff of long-term care and designated supportive living facilities.
Overnight surgeries include operations such as orthopedic surgery.
	
Some cardiac procedures have already resumed.
Decisions on which surgeries proceed are based on clinical need. The sickest Albertans and those who have waited longest will be booked first. These decisions are being made at the zone level and are also informed by the pandemic response in different parts of the province.


Maternity services in the Calgary zone were consolidated at the Foothills Medical Centre, Rockyview General Hospital and Peter Lougheed Centre on April 21.
	
Services to be reinstated on June 3 at South Health Campus in southeast Calgary include inpatient labour and delivery, NICU, postpartum and newborn care.
Services to be reinstated on June 3 at High River Hospital include inpatient maternal and newborn services.

À partir du 25 mai, des tests volontaires seront disponibles dans les établissements de soins de longue durée et les établissements d’aide à la vie autonome de niveau 4, et les résidents et résidentes de Calgary pourront prendre rendez-vous en ligne pour subir des tests pour la COVID-19 en ligne.
Les interventions chirurgicales non urgentes nécessitant un séjour à l’hôpital reprendront également la semaine prochaine. Les services de maternité reprendront au South Health Campus de Calgary et à l’hôpital de High River dès le 3 juin.
Environ 27 000 résidents et 44 000 membres du personnel des établissements de soins de longue durée et des établissements d’aide à la vie autonome de niveau 4 (ceux qui offrent un niveau d’aide plus élevé aux personnes ayant des besoins plus complexes) peuvent désormais être testés pour la COVID-19, s’ils le souhaitent, même s’ils n’ont aucun symptôme. L’augmentation des tests pour ce groupe de population le plus vulnérable améliorera notre capacité à détecter les cas à un stade précoce, à prévenir d’éventuelles éclosions et à assurer la sécurité des personnes.
Alors que Calgary s’apprête à rouvrir davantage d’entreprises dans le cadre de la première étape de la stratégie de relance de l’Alberta, les Services de santé de l’Alberta (Alberta Health Services) ajouteront une extension à l’outil d’autoévaluation en ligne pour la région de Calgary, à compter du 25 mai. Les individus symptomatiques de la zone pourront prendre leur propre rendez-vous pour subir un test s’ils vivent à moins de 50 kilomètres d’un centre d’évaluation et si l’outil d’autoévaluation indique qu’un test est requis.
Cette fonctionnalité supplémentaire permettra aux utilisateurs de planifier plus facilement un test pour la COVID-19 à un moment et à un endroit qui leur conviennent. Cette extension permettra également aux responsables de la santé publique d’accéder plus rapidement aux renseignements sur les tests au fur et à mesure de la relance.
Les interventions chirurgicales non urgentes comprendront davantage de chirurgies d’un jour et celles nécessitant une hospitalisation. Ces interventions ont été suspendues pour s’assurer que le système de santé avait la capacité d’aider les personnes touchées par la COVID-19. Les Albertains et les Albertaines qui ont attendu le plus longtemps recevront des soins en priorité. Les responsables communiqueront directement avec les patients pour les informer de la date de leur intervention.
Depuis la reprise des chirurgies d’un jour le 4 mai dernier, environ 3 000 opérations prévues ont été effectuées dans la province. En outre, des interventions chirurgicales d’urgence ont été possibles tout au long de la pandémie.

« Les Albertains et les Albertaines ont brillamment réussi à aplatir la courbe des infections de la COVID-19 et à réduire le risque pour les femmes et les hommes dévoués qui travaillent dans nos hôpitaux. Par conséquent, nous pouvons reprendre en toute sécurité la prestation des soins réguliers dont la population a besoin. Je sais que le report des services prévus a été difficile pour les patients et les familles, mais c’était la bonne chose à faire dans le cadre de notre stratégie globale qui visait à protéger les Albertains et les Albertaines des répercussions de la pandémie. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé

À compter du 3 juin, des services de maternité seront de nouveau offerts au South Health Campus de Calgary et à l’hôpital de High River. Les familles ont actuellement accès à ces services dans des établissements voisins, car ils ont été consolidés le 21 avril pour s’assurer que la région disposait d’espace et de ressources pour gérer la COVID-19.

« La sécurité des patients est notre priorité absolue. Nous sommes extrêmement reconnaissants aux femmes et aux familles de leur patience pendant la suspension temporaire des services de maternité dans le sud de Calgary et à High River. Je veux assurer aux familles que les hôpitaux restent un lieu sûr pour les femmes enceintes qui doivent accoucher, et pour les mères et les nouveau-nés qui doivent recevoir des soins pendant la pandémie. »
Dre Verna Yiu, présidente et directrice générale, Services de santé de l’Alberta

En bref

Les soins de longue durée comptent le plus grand nombre de cas confirmés de la COVID-19 dans tous les milieux de vie collectifs en Alberta.
Selon les estimations, jusqu’à 53 500 tests volontaires seront pratiqués sur les résidents et le personnel des établissements de soins de longue durée et des établissements d’aide à la vie autonome.
Les interventions chirurgicales avec hospitalisation comprennent des opérations telles que la chirurgie orthopédique.
	
Certaines procédures cardiaques ont déjà repris.
Les décisions concernant les interventions chirurgicales sont fondées sur les besoins cliniques. Les personnes les plus malades et celles qui ont attendu le plus longtemps seront les premières à avoir un rendez-vous. Ces décisions sont prises dans chaque zone, et elles sont également influencées par la réponse à la pandémie dans différentes parties de la province.


Le 21 avril, les services de maternité de la zone de Calgary ont été regroupés au centre médical Foothills, à l’hôpital général de Rockyview et au centre Peter Lougheed.
Les services qui seront rétablis le 3 juin au South Health Campus, dans le sud-est de Calgary, comprennent le travail et l’accouchement en milieu hospitalier, l’unité de soins intensifs néonatals, les soins postnataux et les soins aux nouveau-nés.
Les services qui seront rétablis le 3 juin à l’hôpital de High River comprennent les services d’hospitalisation des mères et des nouveau-nés.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.





“I want to thank everyone in Calgary and Brooks for waiting patiently as we worked together to flatten the curve. We will continue to have a staggered approach to relaunch, but fortunately active cases have come down significantly from the peak of just a few weeks ago and it’s time to continue opening up our economy. I encourage folks to get outside, stay safe, and support local businesses.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Starting May 25, hairstyling and barbershops will be permitted to reopen in Calgary and Brooks, and cafés, restaurants, pubs and bars can reopen for table service at 50 per cent capacity. This is in addition to the reopening of limited businesses and activities in these cities on May 14.
Stage one of Alberta’s relaunch strategy puts safety first as restrictions are gradually lifted. Calgary and Brooks saw a more gradual reopening because of higher case numbers in these two communities. The delay was made to balance public safety with the need to get businesses open and services restored for Albertans.

“Relaunching our province requires continued patience from all of us, and it is critical all Albertans continue to practise the public health measures we’ve put in place to protect Albertans. As we move forward with reopening additional businesses and services in Calgary and Brooks, I remind all Albertans to support local businesses, but to do so in a safe and responsible way. Take appropriate precautions, stay home if you are sick and continue to look out for each other. We will succeed by supporting each other through each stage of relaunch.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

With enhanced testing capacity and contact tracing ability, along with a rapid response plan in place in the event of possible outbreaks, the province has begun to take the incremental steps to reopen some businesses and services.
Stage one – cities of Calgary and Brooks
Opened May 14:

Retail businesses, such as clothing, furniture and bookstores.
All vendors at farmers markets are able to operate.
Museums and art galleries.
Daycares and out-of-school care with limits on occupancy.
Resumption of some scheduled, non-urgent surgeries.
Regulated health professions are permitted to offer services as long as they continue to follow approved guidelines set by their professional colleges.

Opening May 25:

Hairstyling and barbershops.
Cafés, restaurants, pubs and bars will be permitted to reopen for table service only at 50 per cent capacity.

Opening June 1:

Day camps, including summer school, will be permitted with limits on occupancy.
Post-secondary institutions will continue to deliver courses; however, there will be more flexibility to include in-person delivery once the existing health order prohibiting in-person classes is lifted.
Places of worship and funeral services can be expanded if they follow specific guidance already online.

The new alberta.ca/bizconnect web page provides business owners with information on health and safety guidelines for general workplaces, as well as sector-specific guidelines for those able to open in stage one. Businesses allowed to reopen during stage one are subject to strict infection prevention and control measures, and will be carefully monitored for compliance with public health orders. It is up to each business operator to determine if they are ready to open and ensure all guidance has been met.

Physical distancing requirements of two metres remain in place through all stages of relaunch and hygiene practices will continue to be required of businesses and individuals, along with instructions for Albertans to stay home when exhibiting symptoms such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose, or sore throat. Albertans are also encouraged to wear non-medical masks when out in public places where keeping a distance of two metres is difficult.
Progression to stage two will be determined by the success of stage one, considering health-care system capacity, hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) cases, and infection rates. For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.

Quick facts

The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes washing your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.


Anyone showing symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. To access testing, complete the COVID-19 self-assessment online. A separate self-assessment tool is available for health-care and shelter workers, enforcement and first responders. After completing the form, there is no need to call 811.
Albertans are asked to share acts of kindness they have experienced in their community during this difficult time by using the hashtag #AlbertaCares.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Agriculture and Forestry provided $81,000 to the Alberta Farm Fresh Producers Association (AFFPA) through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership to enhance its online producer directory.
The grant allowed AFFPA to expand its directory to include more producer profiles and build awareness of the high-quality farm-fresh food Alberta is known for. The site will now give retailers, wholesalers, restaurants and the food service industry more opportunities to connect with farms.
With the recent increase in demand for local food, the province’s restaurants and stores have looked for new ways to bring more locally grown and produced food to Albertans.
Site enhancements include:

Additional and more detailed product categories.
Identification of additional certifications and licensing.
More marketing channels for producers to include food service and retail.
Improved search and mapping capabilities.

The AFFPA will also be offering complimentary memberships for farmers and ranchers for 2020 and 2021.

“Alberta’s farmers grow the best food in the world. We’re proud to work with the AFFPA to help get our high-quality, locally sourced food into more kitchens across Alberta.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


“AFFPA is excited to partner with the provincial and federal governments to further promote Alberta local food. With increased connections between Alberta producers, processors, retail and food service, more Albertans will be able to enjoy the great locally produced and processed food.”
Willard de Wilde, president, Alberta Farm Fresh Producers Association


“This initiative will help solidify the connections between the agriculture producers who want to direct market and their potential customers. It will also heighten the image of this segment of the industry, highlighting what products are available from Alberta producers.”
Rod Bradshaw, Beck Farms

Quick facts

AFFPA is a voluntary membership, non-profit organization representing direct market growers across Alberta.
Local food sales from farmers markets and through direct-to-consumer channels have more than doubled since 2008 and exceeded $1 billion in 2018.

Grant Thornton Canada conducted the independent financial cost management and governance review. The scope of Grant Thornton’s review focused on:

Board procedures, related governance practices and decision-making.
Effectiveness of financial management and internal control processes.
Funding and allocation of resources including program delivery costing.
Control of public information.
Specific cost centres including head office lease options, staffing levels and related compensation and procurement.

The review did highlight some positives about the CBE’s operations, including having costs related to maintenance and planning that are comparable to other metro school boards. Procurement practices were also generally found to be appropriate to address related risks. However, Grant Thornton found a need for an improvement in governance and planning for financial sustainability.

“Overall, the findings are indicative of an organization that has undergone turmoil at the governance level with a focus on process over function and a short-term view of financial sustainability.”
Grant Thornton Financial Cost Management and Governance Review of the Calgary Board of Education

Some of Grant Thornton’s findings include:

The board places more of a focus on protecting themselves rather than focusing on the CBE’s broader mission.
Increased class sizes due to centralizing some teaching staff at the board office.
A failure to consider multiple options to reduce the financial risk of the Education Centre building.

To ensure the CBE works to address the concerns highlighted in the review, Education Minister Adriana LaGrange issued a ministerial order directing the CBE to improve its governance and financial management practices.

“The Calgary Board of Education must act now to improve operations in order to direct as many dollars as possible to the classroom. As the independent report shows, the board’s short-term view focused more on protecting individuals on the board rather than its overall duty. This is unacceptable.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

The recommendations in the order focus mainly on governance and improving governance over the future operations of the Calgary Board of Education.
The recommendations fall into several themes:

governance
Calgary Board of Education central office building (Education centre)
financial management
procurement and expenditures
communication
staffing levels and compensation

A summary of the recommendations is available online.
The ministerial order takes effect immediately and the board must complete all recommendations by Nov. 30. Failure to do so will result in dissolution of the board of trustees.

Strengthening safety measures for travellers

The Alberta government is enacting the strongest public health measures in the country for international travellers to prevent the spread of travel-related COVID-19 cases.
Travellers arriving at the Edmonton and Calgary airports from outside Canada will have to pass a provincial checkpoint, have their temperature taken using an infrared camera and complete an Alberta isolation questionnaire that details how they will follow mandatory isolation requirements.
Provincial officials will follow up with arriving travellers within three days to ensure they are following public health orders and have the information and support they need.
Read today’s news release for more.

Access to justice

The Provincial Court of Alberta has updated its plan for the staged resumption of court operations. The changes involve family mediation; the rescheduling and adjournment of provincial tickets, bylaws and other matters; and criminal adult out-of-custody criminal trials and preliminary inquiries.

The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes washing your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.


Anyone showing symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. To access testing, complete the COVID-19 self-assessment online. A separate self-assessment tool is available for health-care and shelter workers, enforcement and first responders. After completing the form, there is no need to call 811.
Albertans are asked to share acts of kindness they have experienced in their community during this difficult time by using the hashtag #AlbertaCares.

Transportation Minister Ric McIver, along with St. Albert mayor Cathy Heron and Morinville-St. Albert MLA Dale Nally, attended a groundbreaking ceremony to kick off twinning construction for Ray Gibbon Drive between Anthony Henday Drive and Villeneuve Road.
The $54.2-million project will be cost-shared 50-50 between the Government of Alberta and the City of St. Albert. The province’s share of the funding will flow in the final four years of the project, which will enhance safety, improve commute times for families and reduce traffic congestion in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region.

“Ray Gibbon Drive is an important route for St. Albert and this twinning project is one of the top five priorities of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board. Our government confirmed over $27 million for the expansion to make it easier for families and businesses to get in and out of the community with less congestion and better driving conditions. Additionally, this project will help create over 150 badly needed jobs for Albertans.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation


“This project has not only been a priority for St. Albert, but for the broader Edmonton Metropolitan Region. We appreciate the support of the Province in partnering with the City to share the costs of this expansion with us over the next decade.”
Cathy Heron, mayor, City of St. Albert


“This long-awaited expansion of Ray Gibbon Drive is significant for St. Albert and surrounding areas. I’d like to thank Minister McIver and the City of St. Albert for making sure this important project is finally completed – it will encourage economic development in the area, support jobs for Albertans, and greatly reduce traffic congestion in St. Albert.”
Dale Nally, MLA, Morinville-St. Albert

More than 20,000 vehicles a day travel Ray Gibbon Drive, which connects St. Albert with Anthony Henday Drive, the Yellowhead Highway and the City of Edmonton.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Capital funding for school divisions has been increased by $250 million to help boost the economy, while also accelerating important maintenance to existing schools. This funding will support hundreds of projects in all school divisions across the province. The work will create about 3,750 jobs and see more Albertans working again sooner.

“We’re getting Albertans back to work by investing in hundreds of infrastructure and renewal projects in schools across the province. This is great news for staff and students who will benefit from more modern learning environments.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

The province will work with school divisions to invest dollars in the most efficient and effective ways possible. Specific projects will be confirmed by the start of June. The majority of projects are anticipated to be completed by October.

“Increased funding for capital maintenance and renewal – along with 74 school projects in design, planning and construction – will create jobs when we need them most, while enhancing the value and lifespan of our province’s infrastructure.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure

This initiative is an acceleration of investment in school maintenance and renewal projects, and is separate from funding for new schools or modernizations. Approved projects must align with the requirements of Alberta Education’s Infrastructure Maintenance and Renewal program and fall into one of the following categories:

building envelope (e.g., roofs, doors, windows, exterior finishes)
mechanical (e.g., plumbing, heating and ventilation)
electrical (e.g., lighting upgrades)
structural (e.g., foundations)
site improvements (e.g., parking lot repair, regrading for drainage)
interior upgrades


“The Alberta School Boards Association is pleased with this additional investment by the provincial government, as schools are the heart of our local communities. This provides timely support as many school boards face challenges with aging facilities.”
Lorrie Jess, president, Alberta School Boards Association


“Increased infrastructure and maintenance funding will allow school divisions across the province to accelerate upgrades to their schools. In turn, this increased funding will enhance learning spaces for our students while helping divisions extend the lifespan of their aging school facilities.”
Bevan Daverne, president, College of Alberta School Superintendents

This initiative is part of Alberta’s capital maintenance and renewal (CMR) stimulus plan. The province is doubling CMR funding in 2020-21 from $937 million to $1.9 billion so more companies can keep their workers employed during these challenging times and Albertans can benefit from these projects sooner.

Public health measures will be implemented in phases.
During the first phase, travellers arriving at the Calgary and Edmonton international airports from outside Canada will be required to pass through a provincial checkpoint where they will need to complete an Alberta isolation plan. Travellers will also undergo a thermal scan, as elevated body temperature is a potential symptom of COVID-19.

“Countries like Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea have been successful at mitigating the spread because they took immediate action securing their borders long before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. I’ve been clear it was irresponsible for Canada to wait so long to close our borders, especially from countries with high levels of infection. While Alberta does not control who can fly here, we will deploy a more rigorous approach in screening international arrivals. These measures are critical to ensure we continue to flatten the curve and keep Albertans safe.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

As part of their isolation plan, travellers must detail if they have an appropriate place to isolate for the required 14 days, how they will travel to their isolation location, and their plans for getting essentials like food and medications. If required, provincial officials will help travellers access support to meet isolation requirements.
Government officials will follow up with travellers within three days to ensure they are following public health orders and have the information and support they need.

“As the peak of the virus passes and the world begins to move forward, travel will slowly increase. Controlling the spread of COVID-19, especially travel-related cases, is a key step in protecting Albertans and continuing to flatten the curve. Protect yourselves and your loved ones by following all public health measures and practising physical distancing and good hygiene.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

The Calgary and Edmonton airports are also implementing enhanced cleaning protocols for arrival lounges and high-touch surfaces, placing hand sanitizer stations at every kiosk and touch screen machine.
Phase two will involve establishing a similar provincial checkpoint at the Alberta-U.S. border crossing at Coutts, which is the busiest in the province. The checkpoint will help welcome people to the province while ensuring travellers are aware of Alberta’s COVID-19 protocols. Essential economic travel will not be disrupted.
All travellers are also encouraged to download the ABTraceTogether app when they arrive in Alberta. The app enhances the current manual tracing process and helps protect people and their loved ones. 
This initiative is part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely begin removing public health restrictions and reopen our economy. For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.
Quick facts

The global travel advisory remains in effect, and the Canada-U.S. border remains closed to all non-essential traffic.
All travellers arriving in Alberta from outside Canada are required to isolate for 14 days and monitor for symptoms.
The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.

Dans le cadre de sa stratégie de relance, le gouvernement albertain met en place les mesures de santé publique les plus strictes au pays pour les voyageurs internationaux afin de prévenir la propagation des cas de COVID-19 liés aux voyages.
Les mesures de santé publique seront mises en œuvre par étapes.
Au cours de la première phase, les voyageurs arrivant aux aéroports internationaux de Calgary et d'Edmonton en provenance de l'étranger devront passer par un point de contrôle provincial, où ils devront remplir un plan d'isolement albertain. Les voyageurs seront également soumis à une analyse thermique, une température corporelle élevée pouvant être un symptôme de la COVID-19.

« Des pays comme Taïwan, Singapour et la Corée du Sud ont réussi à limiter la propagation parce qu'ils ont pris des mesures immédiates pour sécuriser leurs frontières et ce, avant que l'Organisation mondiale de la santé ne déclare la COVID-19 comme une pandémie. J'ai été clair : il était irresponsable de la part du Canada d'attendre si longtemps pour fermer ses frontières, surtout avec les pays où les niveaux d'infection étaient élevés. Bien que l'Alberta ne contrôle pas qui peut venir ici par avion, nous allons déployer une approche plus rigoureuse dans le dépistage des arrivants internationaux. Ces mesures sont essentielles pour nous permettre de continuer à aplanir la courbe et à assurer la sécurité des Albertaines et des Albertains. »
Jason Kenney, premier ministre

Dans le cadre de leur plan d’isolement, les voyageurs doivent préciser s'ils disposent d'un endroit approprié pour s'isoler pendant les 14 jours requis, comment ils se rendront à leur lieu d'isolement et quels sont leurs plans pour obtenir des produits de première nécessité comme de la nourriture et des médicaments.
Si nécessaire, les fonctionnaires provinciaux aideront les voyageurs à obtenir de l’aide pour répondre aux exigences d’isolement.
Les responsables gouvernementaux effectueront un suivi auprès des voyageurs dans les trois jours pour s'assurer que ces derniers respectent les consignes de santé publique et qu'ils disposent des informations et du soutien dont ils ont besoin.

« À mesure que le pic de l’épidémie passe et que le monde commence à aller de l’avant, les voyages augmenteront progressivement. Le contrôle de la propagation de la COVID-19, en particulier celle liée aux voyages, est une étape clé pour protéger les Albertaines et les Albertains et continuer à aplanir la courbe. Protégez-vous et protégez vos proches en suivant toutes les mesures de santé publique, en pratiquant l'éloignement physique et en maintenant de bonnes habitudes d’hygiène. »
Dre Deena Hinshaw, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de l'Alberta

Les aéroports de Calgary et d'Edmonton mettent également en place des protocoles de nettoyage améliorés pour les salles d'arrivée ainsi que pour les surfaces fréquemment touchées, en installant du désinfectant pour les mains à chaque kiosque et à chaque machine à écran tactile.
La deuxième phase consistera à mettre en place un point de contrôle provincial similaire au poste frontalier entre l'Alberta et les États-Unis à Coutts, qui est le plus fréquenté de la province. Ce point de contrôle permettra d'accueillir les voyageurs dans la province tout en s'assurant qu’ils connaissent les protocoles de l'Alberta relatifs à la COVID-19. Les déplacements économiques essentiels ne seront pas perturbés.
Tous les voyageurs sont également encouragés à télécharger l'application ABTraceTogether à leur arrivée en Alberta. L'application améliore le processus actuel de traçage manuel et contribue à protéger les individus et leurs proches.
Cette initiative s'inscrit dans le cadre de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta, qui vise à éliminer les restrictions en matière de santé publique et à rouvrir notre économie en toute sécurité. Pour plus d'information, visitez alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy (en anglais seulement).
En bref

L'avis aux voyageurs internationaux reste en vigueur et la frontière entre le Canada et les États-Unis reste fermée à tout trafic non essentiel.
Tous les voyageurs qui arrivent en Alberta en provenance de l'étranger sont tenus de s’isoler (en anglais seulement) pendant 14 jours et de surveiller leurs symptômes.
La mesure la plus importante que les Albertaines et les Albertains peuvent prendre pour prévenir les maladies respiratoires, dont la COVID-19, est de pratiquer une bonne hygiène.
Cela comprend de se laver régulièrement les mains pendant au moins 20 secondes, d’éviter de se toucher le visage, de tousser ou d'éternuer dans son coude ou sa manche, et de jeter ses mouchoirs de façon appropriée.
Toute personne ayant des problèmes de santé ou présentant des symptômes de la COVID-19 doit remplir une auto-évaluation de la COVID-19 en ligne (en anglais seulement).

One of the key conditions for Alberta’s relaunch is strong protection for the most vulnerable, including those in congregate living facilities.
Funding will be used for enhanced staffing and extra cleaning supplies and will address lost accommodation revenue.

“We know from our experience over the past few months that seniors are most at risk from COVID-19. If our province is to carefully and gradually lift public health restrictions, we must first make sure our most vulnerable will remain safe. This funding is another step in that direction and complements ongoing efforts.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“Our government is strengthening our ring of defence around Alberta’s seniors. The funding we are putting into place for seniors lodges to assist with costs arising from COVID-19 protective measures, will help protect seniors housing providers from financial pressures and will help our seniors to remain safe at home.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“We know from our many conversations with continuing care operators that they are struggling to meet the challenges of this unprecedented pandemic. Operators are facing rising costs to maintain operations, comply with provincial health orders and keep Albertans safe. In places where outbreaks have occurred, added precautions to respond to COVID-19 have increased operators’ incremental costs and they have no way to raise revenues to cover them.”
Jennifer McCue, board chair, Alberta Continuing Care Association

A total of $14.2 million will be allocated per month. Funding is retroactive to March 15. There will be a requirement to report on the use of these funds, and facilities will need to return money not spent on COVID-related purposes.
Funding will continue until the orders from Alberta's chief medical officer of health are lifted. It will be distributed in coordination with Alberta Health Services and Seniors and Housing.
This funding is one element of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy that must be in place before Alberta can safely remove public health restrictions. For more information, visit alberta.ca/COVID19.
Quick facts

Seniors lodges, designated supportive living, and long-term care serve about 37,000 people at any point in time.
Designated supportive living and long-term care facilities have already received advanced funding of $24.5 million, as well as funding to increase health-care aide staffing levels and wages.

Un investissement provincial de plus de 170 millions de dollars permettra de protéger contre la COVID-19 les résidents et le personnel des établissements de soins de longue durée, des établissements désignés avec services de soutien et des résidences pour personnes âgées.
L'une des conditions essentielles à la relance de l'Alberta est la protection renforcée des plus vulnérables, y compris ceux qui vivent dans des centres de vie collectifs.
Le financement servira à accroître les capacités de dotation en personnel et de fourniture de produits de nettoyage supplémentaires, et permettra de remédier à la perte de revenus liés à l'hébergement.

« Nous savons, d'après notre expérience des derniers mois, que les personnes âgées sont les plus à risque face à la COVID-19. Si notre province doit lever prudemment et progressivement les restrictions de santé publique, nous devons d'abord veiller à ce que la sécurité des personnes les plus vulnérables soit assurée. Ce financement est un autre pas vers cet objectif et complète les efforts en cours. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé


« Notre gouvernement renforce le réseau de protection des personnes âgées en Alberta. Le financement que nous consacrons aux logements pour personnes âgées aidera à couvrir les coûts découlant des mesures de protection contre la COVID-19, à alléger les pressions financières que subissent les fournisseurs de logements pour personnes âgées et à assurer la sécurité de nos aînés. »
Josephine Pon, ministre des Personnes âgées et du Logement


« Grâce aux nombreuses conversations que nous avons avec les exploitants d'établissements de soins continus, nous savons qu'ils ont de la difficulté à relever les défis de cette pandémie sans précédent. Les exploitants doivent faire face à des augmentations de coûts pour maintenir leurs activités, se conformer aux ordonnances sanitaires provinciales et assurer la sécurité des Albertains. Dans les établissements où des éclosions sont survenues, les précautions qui ont été mises en place afin de contrer la COVID-19 ont engendré des coûts supplémentaires et les exploitants ne disposent d’aucun moyen pour augmenter leurs revenus et couvrir ces coûts. »
Jennifer McCue, présidente du conseil d'administration Alberta Continuing Care Association

Un total de 14,2 millions de dollars sera versé par mois. Le financement est rétroactif au 15 mars. Il y aura une obligation de rendre compte de l'utilisation de ces fonds, et les établissements devront restituer les sommes qui ne sont pas dépensées pour lutter contre la COVID-19.
Le financement se poursuivra jusqu'à ce que les ordonnances de la médecin hygiéniste en chef de l'Alberta soient levées. Il sera réparti en coordination avec les Alberta Health Services et le ministère albertain des Personnes âgées et du Logement.
Ce financement est un élément de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta qui doit être mis en place avant que la province puisse lever de façon sécuritaire les restrictions de santé publique. Pour obtenir de plus amples renseignements, visitez le site alberta.ca/COVID19 (en anglais seulement).
En bref

Les résidences pour personnes âgées, les établissements désignés avec services de soutien et les établissements de soins de longue durée accueillent environ 37 000 personnes.
Les établissements désignés avec services de soutien et les établissements de soins de longue durée ont déjà reçu un financement anticipé de 24,5 millions de dollars, ainsi que des fonds qui servent à augmenter les effectifs et les salaires d'aide-soignants.

At about 3:30 a.m., officers were dispatched in response to a 911 call reporting a possible assault in progress at an apartment in west Edmonton. The caller reported hearing screaming and yelling coming from inside a suite. Upon arrival, events occurred that resulted in the officers attempting to force entry into the suite. While trying to gain entry, a confrontation occurred with a man who attempted to prevent entry, and several less-lethal use of force options were deployed. Ultimately, the man went onto the balcony of the fourth-floor suite and jumped or fell four storeys to the ground below. Independent evidence would suggest that no officers were on the balcony at the time. Three other individuals – a 28-year-old woman, a 24-year-old woman, and a two-year-old child – were inside the suite at the time of the incident.
The 24-year-old man was transported to hospital and admitted with life-threatening injuries. On May 16, the man died in hospital.
ASIRT investigators are asking anyone who was in the area of 170 Street and 64 Avenue at about 3:30 a.m. and may have witnessed and/or may have any video of these events to contact ASIRT by calling 780-644-1483.
ASIRT’s investigation will seek to determine whether the actions of any police officer caused or contributed to the death of the man. With ASIRT’s investigation underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

Country music superstar and anti-human trafficking advocate Paul Brandt will lead the seven-member task force that will provide guidance and recommendations on how to best implement the government’s nine-point action plan to combat human trafficking.

“Alberta should be a place where people can live safely, free from exploitation and coercion. Sadly, human trafficking exists in our province, and it is our duty to bring these human rights violations to light and do more to protect those at risk. This provincial Human Trafficking Task Force brings together knowledgeable and dedicated individuals to provide advice on protecting and empowering some of Alberta’s most vulnerable.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Our government will always stand up for innocent, at-risk individuals who are being bought and sold in our province. We are committed to preventing human trafficking networks from taking root in Alberta – whether it involves sexual exploitation, forced labour or illegal organ trade. This task force includes advocates with the skills and experience to do this important work.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


""Human trafficking is one of the fastest-growing crimes in the world, and it must be stopped. Serving as chair for the Alberta Human Trafficking Task Force is an immense privilege and responsibility, as we work together to protect those who are most vulnerable. Freedom should be for everybody.""
Paul Brandt, chair, Human Trafficking Task Force


“The task force is instrumental in compelling us to move forward on challenging and complex issues. I am confident the members understand the exploitation, suffering and trauma caused by human trafficking. I trust they are committed to listening to those who have suffered, stakeholders working to support survivors along the long journey to recovery, and law enforcement who understand the coercive and profiteering dynamics of trafficking, organized crime, money laundering and other elements. This is hopeful work, and I urge the task force to consider the demand component that drives human trafficking.""
Kate Quinn, executive director, Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation


“The Human Trafficking Task Force will guide us on the best way to protect Albertans who are most at risk of human trafficking. Together, we will coordinate a response across government and community so we can combat this insidious crime.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women


“I am proud to be part of a movement to stand up for vulnerable people impacted by human trafficking in our province. This task force will help make a difference in preventing human trafficking and supporting survivors. I am confident the combined knowledge of the task force will help our government address this serious issue and protect vulnerable Albertans from exploitation and assault.”
Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services


“Our children and youth have a right to be safe. This task force will help us find ways to protect and empower survivors of human trafficking and provide guidance for us to take the right steps and make the necessary changes to end this horrible crime.”
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services

The task force will:

Provide guidance and recommendations on supports for survivors.
Enhance collaboration among all stakeholders and organizations that work with survivors of human trafficking in order to prevent, protect and ensure their safety.
Engage experts to identify what actions are needed to bring transformational and sustainable change.
Provide recommendations to help government implement the nine-point action plan and lobby other levels of government to take coordinated action.

The first two meetings will be held on May 20 and 21.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




This measure will free up between $16 million and $27 million in additional cash flow for the hospitality sector, which employs 30,000 Albertans.
It will also help position the sector for recovery, as our government takes steps to gradually reopen businesses and services and get people back to work.
Travel Alberta is also working on measures to support local tourism organizations across Alberta that will be announced at a later date.

“Alberta’s tourism industry is a key contributor to our economy and it creates jobs and revenue that so many communities across our province depend on. We’re committed to providing industry the support it needs now so that it can recover and grow.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism


“The tourism industry, and our accommodations providers, were dramatically and suddenly hard hit by the impacts of COVID-19. These businesses play a critical role in the traveller experience and will be essential in the restart of Alberta’s visitor economy. Travel Alberta looks forward to working with our accommodations providers to rebuild the sector.”
Royce Chwin, CEO, Travel Alberta

Amounts collected prior to March 1, 2020 that are being deferred under the previously announced deferral program can continue to be deferred until August 31, 2020.
Accommodation providers are still expected to file returns throughout 2020, as required by legislation, and will be expected to resume regular tourism levy payments in 2021. Additional program details will be provided in the coming weeks.

“At the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, the AHLA participated in an industry roundtable call with the Premier and identified liquidity as our industry’s top concern. One of our key asks was for government to leave every tax dollar possible in the hands of our members to support liquidity for their business. Today’s announcement directly supports our ask and is positive news for hotels in Alberta. We sincerely thank the Government of Alberta for this support.”
Dave Kaiser, president and CEO, Alberta Hotel and Lodging Association


“The government’s decision to halt the collection of the Alberta Tourism Levy (ATL) payments from hotels through to Dec. 31 is a measure that will help the tourism industry begin to reopen. A business’s ability to preserve limited cash flow to assist with purchases of inventory, supplies, and to rehire staff can certainly be aided when government moves from deferral of fees like the ATL, to abatement.”
Alida Visbach, board chair, Tourism Industry Association of Alberta

These new measures are part of the Government of Alberta’s broader plan to help Alberta’s tourism industry recover and eventually grow. The three-phase plan will focus on:

responding and providing the sector with immediate relief
relaunching and supporting the sector through recovery
rebuilding and positioning the sector for growth

The Government of Alberta and Travel Alberta’s work to develop a 10-year tourism strategy is ongoing. The strategy is being repositioned to ensure there is a solid plan in place to rebuild Alberta’s tourism industry, while laying the groundwork for long-term growth.
Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance physical distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

“While we are disappointed to hear these reports from the Biden campaign, we remain confident Keystone XL remains a critical part of North America’s post-pandemic economic recovery.
“The project — already under construction — has long held widespread bipartisan support from U.S. lawmakers including all governors in the states the pipeline travels through. The majority of American people have consistently backed Keystone XL in large part due to the tens of thousands of U.S. jobs the pipeline will support, and the millions of dollars in tax revenue that will be used to build better communities for American families. Today, unionized workers are already working on this shovel ready project that puts citizens in both Canada and the U.S. back to work.
“The pipeline is the most studied in American history and has been deemed safe and in the public interest through multiple state and federal reviews, including two under the Obama administration.
“Our government invested in this project because it is tied to our province's vital long term economic interests. It will lead to higher prices as well as increased volumes of oil sands crude production, generating at least $30 billion in increased royalties over 20 years for Alberta taxpayers.
“The project will put 12,000 Canadians to work and will generate billions of dollars of employment income for Canadian and U.S. workers at a time when they need it most.
“Rather than speculating about the outcome of the U.S. election, we will spend our time continuing to meet with our U.S. allies and speak to Alberta’s role in supporting North American energy independence and security.
“Without more Canadian crude, the U.S. will be subject to increased reliance on heavy crude oil from places like Venezuela and will continue to be a victim of the same price wars and instability we recently witnessed from Russia and Saudi Arabia.
“As our closest friend and ally, we would expect the U.S. government, regardless of electoral politics, to respect the Canada-U.S. relationship.
“Our government will work with TC Energy and the Government of Canada to defend the value of our investment in this project that is a vital part of Canada-U.S. relations.”

“For over 150 years, Canadians across our Dominion have celebrated today as the birthday of our head of state, beginning with Her Imperial Majesty Queen Victoria.
“Today, we continue that tradition by celebrating the official Canadian birthday of her great-great-granddaughter, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II – the only monarch most of us have ever known. She represents not only the stability and strength of our constitutional order, but also a voice of encouragement and resilience during these troubled times.
“Of course in Alberta, Victoria Day is also known as the unofficial beginning of summer. Now more than ever, Albertans are going to want to get out of their homes to enjoy our amazing outdoors. We encourage people to do so, which is why we are gradually reopening services at provincial parks.
“I hope that Albertans have a great ‘May long’ while staying safe to limit the spread of COVID-19.
“And long live the Queen.”

“During this time in quarantine, we have had the chance to reflect on the world around us. Family and community supports, and random acts of kindness have shown us the nature and kindness of many of our neighbours, associates and sometimes complete strangers.  
“In Alberta, we have made great progress in building safe communities that welcome everyone, celebrating the freedom to love. However, LGBTQ2S+ people around the world and in our province continue to experience homophobia, transphobia and biphobia.
“This year, the theme of International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia is ‘break the silence.’ The lived experiences of LGBTQ2S+ Albertans show the cost of exclusion to our society and how to raise awareness about barriers, violence, and discrimination. 
“It is our collective responsibility to ensure all Albertans are free to live and love, and that all people are accepted and valued.”

“Our government thanks the members of the Fair Deal Panel, and all Albertans who took the time to participate in the process, for their hard work on an issue that is vital to the well-being of our province. I look forward to giving this report and its recommendations the proper attention it deserves once we have safely started to implement our relaunch strategy.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Premier Jason Kenney created the panel in November 2019 in response to the unprecedented levels of frustration Albertans have experienced with the province’s voice in Canada. The report deals with how best to define and secure a fair deal for Alberta in Canada’s Confederation, and is informed by the input of tens of thousands of Albertans.
The Fair Deal Panel gathered input for the report through in-person town hall engagement sessions, a survey, interviews with experts and stakeholders, polling, and online submissions and emails. Subjects covered include potentially moving towards a provincial pension plan, establishing a provincial police force, appointing a Chief Firearms Office for Alberta, and more. The report contains an assessment of Albertans’ positions on how these issues relate to Alberta’s role in Canada, and recommendations on how to strengthen the province’s voice on the national stage.

“Connecting with Albertans and hearing their stories and ideas about how our province fits into the Canadian federation has been the experience of a lifetime. The members of the panel are incredibly proud of the work we have done together, and we fully support government’s decision to postpone its assessment and response to the report until we are safely through the current public health crisis.”
Oryssia Lennie, chair, Fair Deal Panel

Government will announce a date for the public release of the report once the urgency of the COVID-19 response has subsided.

After reviewing applications from across the province for the emergency social services funding announced in April, government will provide $30 million to more than 460 successful applicants to support their responses to COVID-19.
Food banks across Alberta are being provided $5 million in funding to help them feed vulnerable populations.

“Our daily routines and many things we take for granted have had to change, but together Albertans are meeting the challenges of the pandemic. Emergency social services funds are helping communities do more to support vulnerable Albertans.”
Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services


“Alberta seniors have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic – they are dealing with social isolation and trying to find new ways to manage everyday tasks while staying safe. Our government is ensuring senior-serving non-profit organizations receive emergency funding to help our most vulnerable and ensure they have the supports they need.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing

Successful grant recipients provide services to address the social well-being of those most affected by COVID-19, including seniors, Albertans struggling with access to food and other vulnerable groups. Some projects are underway and grant agreements are being finalized with organizations that have been recently notified they are receiving funding.

“It is a challenging time for many Albertans, especially those who struggle to access basic necessities. We are grateful for the Government of Alberta’s support at this time. It allows those of us working in the social sector to connect vulnerable members of our community to essential supports and services. By collaborating with our C5 partner agencies, we are able to create cost efficiencies and maximize the dollars going directly to children, youth and families.”
Meghan Klein, executive director, EMCN Edmonton Mennonite Centre for Newcomers

C5 is a partnership among five Edmonton agencies that provides social supports to a variety of Albertans, including indigenous, newcomers and services for families and children.

Le gouvernement a adopté des mesures pour permettre aux groupes sans but lucratif de lutter contre la pandémie en venant en aide à ceux et celles qui en ont besoin.
Après avoir examiné les demandes des services sociaux d'urgence provenant de partout dans la province pour l’obtention du financement annoncé en avril, le gouvernement fournira 30 millions de dollars à plus de 460 organismes pour soutenir leurs efforts de lutte contre la COVID-19.
Des banques alimentaires de partout en Alberta recevront un financement de 5 millions de dollars afin de les aider à fournir de la nourriture aux populations vulnérables.

« Notre quotidien et de nombreuses autres choses tenues pour acquises ont dû changer, mais la communauté albertaine s’est unie pour surmonter les défis de la pandémie. Les fonds pour les services sociaux d'urgence aident les communautés à faire plus pour soutenir les Albertains et les Albertaines vulnérables. »
Rajan Sawhney, ministre des Services sociaux et communautaires


« Les personnes âgées de l'Alberta ont été affectées par la pandémie de COVID-19 – elles sont confrontées à l'isolement social et tentent de trouver de nouvelles façons de gérer leur quotidien tout en restant en sécurité. Notre gouvernement veille à ce que les organismes sans but lucratif au service des personnes âgées reçoivent un financement d'urgence pour aider les plus vulnérables et veiller à ce que ces personnes disposent du soutien dont elles ont besoin. »
Josephine Pon, ministre des Personnes âgées et du Logement

Les bénéficiaires des subventions fournissent des services qui visent à améliorer le bien-être des personnes les plus touchées par la COVID-19, notamment les personnes âgées, les Albertains et les Albertaines qui ont du mal à accéder à de la nourriture et d'autres groupes vulnérables. Certains projets sont déjà en cours, et des accords de subvention sont en cours de finalisation avec des organismes sélectionnés qui viennent d’être informés.

« Les temps sont durs pour bon nombre d’Albertains et d’Albertaines, en particulier pour tous ceux et celles qui ont du mal à se procurer les produits de première nécessité. Nous sommes reconnaissants du soutien fourni actuellement par le gouvernement de l'Alberta. Il permet à ceux d'entre nous qui travaillent dans le domaine des services sociaux de référer les membres vulnérables de notre communauté aux mesures de soutien et aux services essentiels existants. En collaborant avec nos organismes partenaires du C5, nous sommes en mesure de créer des économies et de maximiser les fonds qui vont directement aux enfants, aux jeunes et aux familles. »
Meghan Klein, directrice, EMCN Edmonton Mennonite Centre for Newcomers

Le C5 est un partenariat formé entre cinq organismes de la ville d'Edmonton qui fournissent des mesures de soutien social à une vaste gamme d’Albertains et d’Albertaines, y compris des autochtones et des nouveaux arrivants, de même que des services aux familles et aux enfants.

Government is encouraging all Albertans to follow public health guidelines and take extra steps to keep themselves and members of their household safe as they head out to provincial parks, cottages and onto public land this weekend.

“Albertans are anxious for adventure and a change of scenery, but we must all be mindful and respectful of the current pandemic health recommendations. If we continue to be vigilant in the face of the pandemic, it will be easier for us to relaunch more of the services and experiences that Albertans enjoy.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

COVID-19 has altered many routine experiences and opportunities, but that doesn’t mean Albertans can’t have a safe and enjoyable kick-start to the summer.

“Alberta's Relaunch Strategy recognizes the importance of the outdoors and recreation for Albertans’ sense of well-being. This long weekend, I am asking Albertans to continue to practise physical distancing and avoid gathering in groups. When outdoors or in public, take all the necessary precautions to protect your health and the health of those around you. Please enjoy the weekend and stay socially connected, but do so as safely and responsibly as possible.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

Alberta’s provincial parks are open, but visitors are reminded some facilities remain closed, campfires are not permitted and camping does not open until June 1. Camping on public land is permitted – as it has been all along – but campfires are not permitted.
To support the safety of Albertans and enforcement staff, including fish and wildlife officers, conservation officers, public lands officers, forest officers and commercial vehicle officers, sheriffs and RCMP will be out on the roads and landscape to promote and enforce good behaviour through education and awareness. If necessary, they will issue fines for violations.

“Our enforcement objective this weekend is to ensure Albertans are looking out for each other while having a safe and enjoyable time. Wherever possible, our enforcement staff will use education and awareness to ensure compliance with land use rules and regulations, and pandemic health guidelines.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General

Before Albertans head out, here are a few things to know to help you enjoy a safe, relaxing and peaceful long weekend:
Parks

The majority of provincial parks’ facilities and amenities remain closed at this time, but we’re ramping up efforts to reopen them.
For everyone’s safety, please come prepared with your own water, snacks, toilet paper and hand sanitizer.
Leave no trace; pack out what you pack in. This will keep our parks clean and reduce potential human-wildlife encounters.
If exploring our natural spaces, be bear and cougar smart. Carry bear spray and know how to use it.
Alberta Parks’ online campsite reservation system is now open for bookings for June 1 onward.

Restrictions

A fire ban is in place for provincial parks and protected areas and on public land. This move will allow emergency resources to remain focused on COVID-19, not putting out human-caused wildfires and supporting community evacuations.

Road safety

Drive to the road conditions. Check 511 Alberta for the latest highway conditions. Remember, May long weekend weather can include snow and rain.
The week of May 12-18 is Canada Road Safety Week. In Alberta, the RCMP, Sheriff Highway Patrol, Edmonton Police Service, Calgary Police Service and other law enforcement will be on the lookout for impaired drivers, distracted drivers and speeders. Exercise common sense on our roads and highways.
If visiting summer cottages, respect the health and safety of small communities by planning your trip without stops for gas or food, where possible.

La sécurité doit passer avant tout en cette longue fin de semaine de la fête de la Reine.
Le gouvernement encourage toute la population albertaine à suivre les directives de santé publique en vigueur et à prendre des mesures supplémentaires pour assurer leur propre sécurité et celle des membres de leur foyer lorsqu'ils se rendront dans les parcs provinciaux, à leurs chalets ou encore sur les terres publiques cette fin de semaine.

« Les Albertains et les Albertaines ont soif d'aventure et de dépaysement, mais il faut garder en mémoire les recommandations en matière de santé en vigueur en ces temps de pandémie et respecter ces recommandations. Si nous continuons à être vigilants face à la situation, il nous sera plus facile de recommencer à offrir un plus grand nombre des services et des expériences que les Albertains chérissent. »

Jason Nixon, ministre de l'Environnement et des Parcs.


La COVID-19 a changé le déroulement de nombreuses expériences et possibilités habituelles, mais cela ne signifie pas que les Albertains et les Albertaines ne peuvent pas vivre un début d'été sûr et agréable.

« La stratégie de relance de l'Alberta reconnaît l'importance qu’occupent le plein air et les loisirs dans le sentiment de bien-être de la population. Cette longue fin de semaine, je demande aux Albertains et aux Albertaines de continuer à pratiquer l’éloignement physique et d'éviter de se réunir en groupe. À l'extérieur ou en public, prenez toutes les précautions nécessaires pour protéger votre santé et celle des personnes qui vous entourent. Profitez de la fin de semaine et restez en contact, mais faites-le de la manière la plus sûre et la plus responsable possible. »
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, médecin hygiéniste en chef.

Les parcs provinciaux de l'Alberta sont ouverts, mais nous rappelons aux visiteurs que certaines installations restent fermées, que les feux de camp sont interdits et que les aires de camping n'ouvriront pas avant le 1er juin. Le camping sur les terres publiques est autorisé, comme toujours, mais les feux de camp sont interdits.
Pour assurer la sécurité de la population et du personnel chargé de l'application de la loi, y compris les agents de la pêche et de la faune, les agents de conservation, les agents des terres publiques, les agents forestiers et les agents de surveillance des véhicules commerciaux, les agents de la paix et de la GRC patrouilleront sur les routes et dans les environs pour promouvoir et faire respecter les bons comportements en éduquant et en sensibilisant les gens. S’il le faut, ils infligeront des amendes en cas d'infraction.

« Notre exercice d'application de la loi cette fin de semaine vise à faire en sorte que les Albertains veillent les uns sur les autres, tout en passant un moment agréable et sûr. Dans la mesure du possible, notre personnel chargé de l'application de la loi aura recours à l'éducation et à la sensibilisation pour assurer le respect de la règlementation en matière d'utilisation des terres, ainsi que des directives en matière de santé en temps de pandémie. »
Doug Schweitzer, ministre de la Justice et solliciteur général

Avant de partir, lisez les renseignements suivants, qui vous aideront à passer une longue fin de semaine sécuritaire, dans la détente et la tranquillité :
Dans les parcs

La majorité des installations et des équipements des parcs provinciaux restent fermés pour l'instant, mais nous redoublons d'efforts pour les rouvrir.
Pour assurer la sécurité de tous, veuillez arriver préparé et emportez votre propre eau, des collations, du papier hygiénique et du désinfectant pour les mains.
Ne laissez aucune trace; remportez tout ce que vous aviez apporté. Vous contribuerez ainsi à garder nos parcs propres et à réduire les risques de rencontres fâcheuses avec la faune.
Si vous explorez nos espaces naturels, soyez vigilant dans les secteurs fréquentés par les ours et les cougars. Transportez du gaz poivré et sachez comment vous en servir.
Le système de réservation des terrains de camping d'Alberta Parks est maintenant accessible en ligne pour les réservations à partir du 1er juin.

Restrictions

Une interdiction de faire du feu est en vigueur dans les parcs provinciaux et les aires protégées, ainsi que sur les terres publiques. Cette mesure permettra aux ressources d'urgence de se concentrer sur la COVID-19, et de ne pas avoir à éteindre des incendies d'origine humaine ou d’appuyer des évacuations.

Sécurité routière

Conduisez en fonction des conditions routières. Consultez le site Alberta 511 pour obtenir des renseignements à jour sur l’état des routes. N’oubliez pas qu’il peut neiger ou pleuvoir en cette longue fin de semaine.
La semaine du 12 au 18 mai est la Semaine canadienne de la sécurité routière. En Alberta, la GRC, la Sheriff Highway Patrol, le service de police d'Edmonton, le service de police de Calgary et d'autres organismes d'application de la loi seront à l'affût des conducteurs en état d'ébriété, des conducteurs distraits et des excès de vitesse. Faites preuve de bon sens sur nos routes et autoroutes.
Si vous vous rendez à un chalet d'été, respectez la santé et la sécurité des petites communautés en planifiant autant que possible de ne pas vous arrêter en route pour faire le plein d’essence ou pour manger.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Government‘s outdated coal policy – which has been in place since 1976 – is being replaced by modern regulatory processes, integrated planning and land use policies. Repealing the policy will eliminate the use of coal categories, a land use classification system that directed how and where coal leasing, exploration and development could occur. Former Coal Category 1 lands – such as those in the eastern slopes – will continue to be protected on public lands.  

“As we strengthen our focus on economic recovery and revitalization, we will continue to make common-sense decisions to create certainty and flexibility for industry, while ensuring sensitive lands are protected for Albertans to continue to enjoy. Rescinding the outdated coal policy in favour of modern oversight will help attract new investment for an important industry and protect jobs for Albertans.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy

Government is placing a strong focus on creating the necessary conditions for the growth of export coal production. This includes the export of metallurgical coal, which is a necessary component in the production of new steel.
Rescinding the coal policy – and removing the coal categories – means the industry will now be subject to the same land use policies as other commodities. It ensures that investors are not subject to outdated land use restrictions, giving them the ability to acquire rights and apply to government to conduct exploration and development activities. To uphold the province’s commitment to responsible energy development, all proposed coal projects will be submitted to the Alberta Energy Regulator and rigorously reviewed based on their merit – instead of outdated land use restrictions that were developed more than 40 years ago.

“Our government is continuing to protect our natural resources, including critical watersheds and biodiversity along the eastern slopes of Alberta’s Rocky Mountains. Through this approach we are striking the balance of ensuring strong environmental protection with providing industry with incentive to increase investment.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

Developed in 1976, the coal policy included an early attempt at land use planning for resource development in Alberta, before modern regulatory processes existed. This land use classification system was the only mechanism of the original policy still in place. All existing laws and regulations relating to coal development remain in place and unchanged. The policy will be repealed effective June 1.
Quick facts

Government continues to move forward on the federal and provincial plan to phase out emissions from low-quality thermal coal in domestic electricity production by 2030.
The continued protection of former Coal Category 1 lands will not infringe on private property or freehold mineral rights.

The completed plan must be posted in places of business or online within seven days of the public being able to attend the business. Information and the plan template is available at alberta.ca/BizConnect.

Guidance available on mask use

Where physical distancing isn’t possible, wearing non-medical masks can help limit the risk of exposure to COVID-19, especially when used with other preventative measures.

Alberta’s provincial historic sites, museums and archives

The Royal Alberta Museum is reopening to the public on May 16 and the Royal Tyrrell Museum is reopening on May 22.
All facilities will follow public health guidelines regarding cleaning and encouraging physical distancing. The reopening status of Alberta’s other historic sites, museums and archives can be found at history.alberta.ca.

Stage one of relaunch has begun

Stage one of Alberta’s relaunch strategy puts safety first as restrictions are gradually lifted and Albertans begin to get back to work. Calgary and Brooks will see a more gradual reopening, taking into account higher case numbers in these two cities, to balance public safety with the need to get businesses open and services restored for Albertans.

Supporting Alberta businesses through relaunch

The Alberta Biz Connect web page provides business owners with information on health and safety guidelines for general workplaces and sector-specific guidelines for those able to open in stage one of relaunch to ensure businesses can reopen safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
For more information, visit alberta.ca/BizConnect

Driver’s licence and vehicle renewal

Albertans are reminded that if their driver’s licence, ID card, or vehicle registration expired or is set to expire March 17 through May 14, they have until May 15 to renew. Albertans whose documents are expiring are encouraged to connect with their local registry agent by phone and explore options to renew their documents by phone, secure email, fax or mail.

Albertans downloading tracer app

The ABTraceTogether app will enhance current manual contact tracing and capacity, and facilitate early detection to help reduce the spread of the virus and better protect Albertans. It means Albertans will be contacted more quickly if they are at risk.
Use of the app is voluntary; users must opt in.
The app does not track the user’s physical location and does not use GPS. Protecting privacy is paramount; all contact data is only on the user’s phone and is deleted after 21 days.  
Secure contact tracing is a cornerstone of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy. More information on the app, including links to download it, can be found online.
The app currently has 169,367 registered users.

“May is Sexual Violence Awareness Month and I want to draw particular attention to sexual violence that can often occur on our post-secondary campuses.
“One in five women attending university or college will experience sexual violence. Most often, it’s by someone she knows – and also most often, she does not report what happened. Many survivors are left feeling isolated, ashamed or that they are to blame. Although it happens less often, men, too, are victims of these crimes. Campus sexual violence is not only physically and emotionally scarring, it steals from students. It robs them of safe places to learn, and it deprives them of the confidence they need to further their academic career.
“All 26 of our public post-secondary institutions have developed policies to combat sexual violence on their campuses, and we continue to work closely with student leaders to help raise awareness of the impacts of sexual violence and explore new ways to combat it on our campuses. Working together, we must call out these crimes and ensure a safe and supportive environment for all. My government colleagues and I stand behind all those working to end campus sexual violence.
“Survivors, I want you to know that we believe you and acknowledge you. Thank you to all of the student leaders who have dedicated themselves to raising awareness of this issue, and to all post-secondary staff who work to protect and care for students. Together, let us continue to make our campuses safer, more compassionate and more responsive.
“I want to give particular acknowledgement and appreciation to Garrett Koehler from the SAIT Students’ Association and Shayla Breen from the Students’ Association of Mount Royal University for their work in this area.
“More can be done and will be done to combat sexual violence on campus.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




ASIRT conducted a thorough and independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident. The complete investigative file was forwarded to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service (ACPS) for an opinion. ASIRT Executive Director Susan D. Hughson, Q.C., having carefully reviewed the complete investigative file and the Crown opinion, has determined that there are reasonable grounds to believe offences were committed and that the officer should be charged.
Today, Const. Joseph Barton, a member of the CPS, was arrested and charged with three counts of perjury. The charges relate to family court proceedings between Const. Barton and a former domestic partner. It is alleged that on three different dates, Const. Barton affirmed two false affidavits and provided testimony in court which he knew to be false.
Const. Barton was released on an undertaking with conditions to appear in Calgary provincial court on July 24.
As these matters are now before the courts, ASIRT will not provide any further information in relation to these incidents. 
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

The Alberta government’s relaunch strategy puts safety first and Albertans are asked to continue to take the proper precautions and follow public health guidelines when visiting museums.

“We know Albertans are craving those regular activities, like going out to museums, and we understand how important it is for people to safely get back to their everyday lives. We are excited that this can be a part of the transition for Albertans. Our museums are following cleaning guidelines and capacity limits, as well as informing visitors how they can participate so we can make this a successful relaunch.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women

Changes to keep visitors and staff safe
Visitors are encouraged to go to the museums’ websites and purchase pre-booked, timed tickets for their visit. Timed tickets will help stagger visitors entering the museums and help meet the new reduced capacity limits. Visitors will not be able to enter the museums without pre-booking.
Both museums’ reopening plans include reduced operating hours and reduced capacity limits in their galleries. Distancing measures, more access to hand sanitizers and new procedures for staff will help keep the museums safe for all.
Visitors are encouraged to visit the museums’ websites for more information about their reopening, the status of galleries (for example, the Children’s Gallery at the Royal Alberta Museum and the Learning Lounge at the Royal Tyrrell Museum will be closed), as well as the guidelines all visitors should follow.
Visitor guidelines

Do not visit the Royal Alberta Museum or Royal Tyrrell Museum if you are exhibiting symptoms related to COVID-19 or feeling unwell.
Continue to follow the alberta.ca/COVID19 guidelines regarding handwashing, physical distancing and good hygiene.
Visitors are encouraged to wear non-medical masks when out in public places where keeping a distance of two metres is difficult.
Make use of the hand sanitizer stations and handwashing facilities located throughout the museum.
Look, but don’t touch.
Be patient – please don’t crowd around exhibits. Practise physical distancing guidelines and wait your turn.
Follow all posted directional or instructional signage.

Additional historic sites reviewing reopening
Alberta’s historic sites are reviewing their operations and determining if they can safely and responsibly reopen to the public. For more information, please visit history.alberta.ca.
Reduced admission prices for opening weekend and weekdays
From opening day to June 30, both the Royal Alberta Museum and the Royal Tyrrell Museum will be offering a 20 per cent discount on opening weekend and weekdays. The discount reflects the changes to the visitor experience that are necessary to protect the health and safety of visitors and staff. The discount applies to regular one-day admissions. Please visit both museums’ websites for full details.
Guidance for museums and art galleries
Museums and art galleries are part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy and are permitted to reopen on May 14. The new Alberta Biz Connect website provides museum and gallery owners and operators with information on health and safety guidelines.
Note: To assist in managing capacity, we ask media outlets interested in reporting from the museums during opening weekend to contact the Royal Alberta Museum at 780-720-1194, and the Royal Tyrrell Museum at 403-820-6208 to book a walk-through.

Le Musée royal de l'Alberta rouvrira ses portes le 16 mai et le musée de paléontologie Royal Tyrrell, le 22 mai.
La stratégie de relance du gouvernement de l’Alberta met la sécurité de la population au premier plan, et les Albertains et Albertaines sont priés de continuer à prendre les précautions nécessaires et à suivre les directives de la santé publique lorsqu'ils visitent les musées.

« Nous savons que les Albertains et les Albertaines ont hâte de reprendre leurs activités habituelles, de visiter les musées, par exemple, et nous comprenons à quel point il est important pour eux de le faire en toute sécurité. Nous sommes heureux que la réouverture de nos musées fasse partie de la transition pour la population albertaine. Nos musées respectent les directives de nettoyage et les limites liées à la capacité d’accueil, et ils informent les visiteurs sur la manière dont ils peuvent participer au succès de la relance. »
Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine

Mesures pour assurer la sécurité des visiteurs et du personnel
Nous invitons les gens à réserver l’heure de leur visite et à acheter leurs billets en ligne, sur les sites des musées. Les billets à heure déterminée permettront d'échelonner l'entrée des visiteurs dans les musées, en plus de permettre de respecter les nouvelles limites en matière de capacité d’accueil. Les visiteurs ne pourront pas entrer dans les musées sans réservation.
Le plan de réouverture des deux musées prévoit une réduction des heures d’ouverture et des limites relatives à la capacité d’accueil dans les galeries. Des mesures d'éloignement, un meilleur accès aux désinfectants pour les mains et de nouvelles procédures pour le personnel contribueront à assurer la sécurité de tous et de toutes dans les musées.
Nous vous invitons à consulter les sites Web des musées pour obtenir de plus amples renseignements sur leur réouverture, le statut des galeries (par exemple, la galerie des enfants du Musée royal de l'Alberta et le salon d'apprentissage du Musée royal de paléontologie demeureront fermés), ainsi que toutes les lignes directrices à respecter.
Lignes directrices pour les visiteurs

Ne visitez pas le Musée royal de l’Alberta ou le musée de paléontologie Royal Tyrrell si vous présentez des symptômes liés à la COVID-19 ou si vous ne vous sentez pas bien.
Continuez à suivre les directives énoncées sur le site d’alberta.ca/COVID19 concernant le lavage des mains, l'éloignement physique et les bonnes pratiques d’hygiène.
Nous encourageons les visiteurs à porter des masques non médicaux lorsqu'ils se trouvent dans des lieux publics où il est difficile de garder une distance d’au moins deux mètres des autres.
Utilisez les stations de désinfection et de lavage des mains situées partout dans le musée.
Regardez, mais ne touchez pas.
Soyez patient – ne vous attroupez pas autour des expositions. Respectez les consignes d'éloignement physique et attendez votre tour.
Suivez les indications et les instructions affichées.

Évaluation de la réouverture d’autres sites historiques
Les sites historiques de l'Alberta réévaluent leurs activités afin de déterminer s'ils peuvent rouvrir au public d’une manière sécuritaire et responsable. Pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez consulter le site history.alberta.ca (en anglais seulement).
Prix d'entrée réduits pendant la fin de semaine de réouverture et les jours de semaine
À compter de l'ouverture jusqu’au 30 juin, le Musée royal de l'Alberta et le musée de paléontologie Royal Tyrrell offriront un rabais de 20 % pendant la fin de semaine de réouverture et les jours de semaine. Ce rabais reflète les modifications qui ont dû être apportées à l'expérience du visiteur pour protéger la santé et la sécurité des visiteurs et du personnel. Il s'applique aux entrées d'une journée seulement. Veuillez consulter les sites Web des deux musées pour plus de détails.
Conseils pour les musées et les galeries d'art
Les musées et les galeries d'art font partie de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta et sont autorisés à rouvrir dès le 14 mai. Le nouveau site Web Alberta Biz Connect fournit aux propriétaires et aux exploitants de musées et de galeries d'art des renseignements sur les lignes directrices en matière de santé et de sécurité.
Remarque : Dans le but de nous aider à gérer la capacité d’accueil, nous demandons aux médias qui souhaitent faire des reportages dans les musées pendant la fin de semaine d'ouverture de communiquer avec le Musée royal de l'Alberta au 780-720-1194 et avec le Musée de paléontologie Royal Tyrrell au 403-820-6208 pour réserver une visite.

Stage one of relaunch set to begin

Stage one of Alberta’s relaunch strategy puts safety first as restrictions are gradually lifted and Albertans begin to get back to work. Calgary and Brooks will see a more gradual reopening, taking into account higher case numbers in these two cities, to balance public safety with the need to get businesses open and services restored for Albertans. Read the news release.

Supporting Alberta businesses through relaunch

The Alberta Biz Connect web page provides business owners with information on health and safety guidelines for general workplaces and sector-specific guidelines for those able to open in stage one of relaunch to ensure businesses can reopen safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
For more information, visit alberta.ca/BizConnect

Getting buildings ready for relaunch

A new guide provides building operators and managers information and instruction on how to flush stagnant water out of pipes and water systems in buildings that have sat vacant or underutilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Building operators should do this work while they continue to be partially closed and as they prepare to reopen their doors to employees, businesses and the public.

Albertans downloading tracer app

The ABTraceTogether app will enhance current manual contact tracing and capacity, and facilitate early detection to help reduce the spread of the virus and better protect Albertans. It means Albertans will be contacted more quickly if they are at risk.
Use of the app is voluntary; users must opt in.
The app does not track the user’s physical location and does not use GPS. Protecting privacy is paramount; all contact data is only on the user’s phone and is deleted after 21 days.  
Secure contact tracing is a cornerstone of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy. More information on the app, including links to download it, can be found online.
The app currently has 165,888 registered users.

Mental health supports

Confidential supports are available to help with mental health concerns. The Mental Health Help Line at 1-877-303-2642 and the Addiction Help Line at 1-866-332-2322 are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Canadian Mental Health Association has a variety of resources available at mentalhealthweek.ca.
The Kids Help Phone is available 24-7 and offers professional counselling, information and referrals and volunteer-led, text-based support to young people by texting CONNECT to 686868.
Online resources provide advice on handling stressful situations and ways to talk with children.

Family violence prevention

A 24-hour Family Violence Information Line is available at 310-1818 to get anonymous help in more than 170 languages.
Alberta’s One Line for Sexual Violence is available at 1-866-403-8000, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
The requirement for in-person Emergency Protection Order (EPO) applications for those fleeing family violence has been temporarily suspended; provincial courts can now hear applications for EPOs via telecommunication.
Information sheets and other resources on family violence prevention are available at alberta.ca/COVID19.

Quick facts

The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.


Any individual exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. People can access testing by completing the COVID-19 self-assessment online. A separate self-assessment tool is available for health-care and shelter workers, enforcement and first responders. After completing the form, there is no need to call 811.
Albertans are asked to share acts of kindness they have experienced in their community during this difficult time by using the hashtag #AlbertaCares.

“As we continue to carefully relaunch our economy, the safety of Albertans remains our top priority. Alberta businesses have demonstrated great resilience through this pandemic. Now it is time to show them our support. I encourage all Albertans to go out and support local businesses in a safe and responsible way. We all have a role to play in supporting our province’s economic well-being, while remaining vigilant in the fight against COVID-19. With care and common sense, we will be able to move steadily and safely through the stages of our relaunch strategy.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Stage one of Alberta’s relaunch strategy puts safety first as restrictions are gradually lifted. Calgary and Brooks will see a slightly more gradual reopening, taking into account higher case numbers in these two communities, to balance public safety with the need to get businesses open and services restored for Albertans.

“Thanks to the sacrifices Albertans have made, much of the province has been successful at flattening the curve. Yet, I know the idea of relaunching our economy evokes strong emotions for many of us. It is OK to feel anxious, but we must move forward for our collective health and well-being. Shop specifically for what you need, not just to browse. Take appropriate precautions, stay home if you are sick and look out for each other. Together, we can successfully move forward in a gradual and thoughtful manner.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

With enhanced testing capacity and contact tracing ability, along with a rapid response plan in place in the event of possible outbreaks, the province is ready to take the first incremental steps to reopen some businesses and services.
Stage one – all areas of Alberta except cities of Calgary and Brooks

With increased infection prevention and control measures to minimize the risk of increased transmission of infections, some businesses and facilities can start to resume operations on May 14 in all areas except the cities of Calgary and Brooks:
	
Retail businesses, such as clothing, furniture and bookstores. All vendors at farmers markets will also be able to operate.
Museums and art galleries.
Daycares and out-of-school care with limits on occupancy.
Hairstyling and barbershops.
Cafés, restaurants, pubs and bars will be permitted to reopen for table service only at 50 per cent capacity.
Day camps, including summer school, will be permitted with limits on occupancy.
Post-secondary institutions will continue to deliver courses; however, there will be more flexibility to include in-person delivery once the existing health order prohibiting in-person classes is lifted.
Places of worship and funeral services, if they follow specific guidance already online.
The resumption of some scheduled, non-urgent surgeries will continue gradually.
Regulated health professions are permitted to offer services as long as they continue to follow approved guidelines set by their professional colleges.


In Calgary and Brooks, the relaunch will be gradual over 18 days due to higher COVID-19 case numbers in these communities.

Stage one – cities of Calgary and Brooks
Opening May 14:

Retail businesses, such as clothing, furniture and bookstores. All vendors at farmers markets will also be able to operate.
Museums and art galleries.
Daycares and out-of-school care with limits on occupancy.
The resumption of some scheduled, non-urgent surgeries will continue gradually.
Regulated health professions are permitted to offer services as long as they continue to follow approved guidelines set by their professional colleges.

Opening May 25:

Hairstyling and barbershops.
Cafés, restaurants, pubs and bars will be permitted to reopen for table service only at 50 per cent capacity.

Opening June 1:

Day camps, including summer school, will be permitted with limits on occupancy.
Post-secondary institutions will continue to deliver courses; however, there will be more flexibility to include in-person delivery once the existing health order prohibiting in-person classes is lifted.
Places of worship and funeral services, if they follow specific guidance already online.

The new alberta.ca/bizconnect web page provides business owners with information on health and safety guidelines for general workplaces, as well as sector-specific guidelines for those able to open in stage one. Businesses allowed to reopen during stage one will be subject to strict infection prevention and control measures, and will be carefully monitored for compliance with public health orders. It will be up to each business operator to determine if they are ready to open and ensure all guidance has been met.
Physical distancing requirements of two metres remain in place through all stages of relaunch and hygiene practices will continue to be required of businesses and individuals, along with instructions for Albertans to stay home when exhibiting symptoms such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose, or sore throat. Albertans are also encouraged to wear non-medical masks when out in public places where keeping a distance of two metres is difficult.
Still not permitted in stage one:

Gatherings of more than 15 people unless otherwise identified in public health orders or guidance.
Gatherings of 15 people or fewer must follow personal distancing and other public health guidelines.
Arts and culture festivals, major sporting events and concerts, all of which involve close physical contact.
Movie theatres, theatres, pools, recreation centres, arenas, spas, gyms and nightclubs will remain closed.
Services offered by allied health disciplines like acupuncture and massage therapy.
Visitors to patients at health-care facilities will continue to be limited; however, outdoor visits are allowed with a designated essential visitor and one other person (a group of up to three people, including the resident), where space permits. However, physical distancing must be practised and all visitors must wear a mask or some other form of face covering.
In-school classes for kindergarten to Grade 12 students.

Recommendations:

Travel outside the province is not recommended.
Remote working is advised where possible.
Encourage Albertans in Calgary and Brooks to wait to access services upon reopening in their communities rather than travelling for services.
Albertans are encouraged to download the ABTraceTogether mobile contact tracing app and use it when in public.

Progression to stage two will be determined by the success of stage one, considering health-care system capacity, hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) cases, and infection rates. For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy.
Quick facts

Relaunch stages will include an evaluation and monitoring period to determine if restrictions should be adjusted. Triggers that will inform decisions on the lessening or tightening of restrictions include hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy.
Confirmed cases, the percentage of positive results and the rate of infection will be monitored on an ongoing basis to inform proactive responses in localized areas of the province.
Decisions will be applied at both provincial and local levels, where necessary. While restrictions are gradually eased across the province, an outbreak may mean that they need to be strengthened temporarily in a local area.
The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise physical distancing and good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.

Avec des directives de sécurité strictes en place, les Albertains et les Albertaines peuvent soutenir les entreprises albertaines et ne devraient pas hésiter à le faire alors que la province relance progressivement son économie.

« Alors que nous continuons prudemment à relancer notre économie, la sécurité des Albertains et des Albertaines demeure notre grande priorité. Les entreprises de la province ont fait preuve d'une grande résilience tout au long de cette pandémie. Il est maintenant temps de leur montrer que nous les appuyons. J'encourage toute la population albertaine à aller soutenir les entreprises locales en toute sécurité et en se montrant responsable. Bien que nous devons rester vigilants dans la lutte contre la COVID-19, nous avons tous un rôle à jouer pour soutenir le bien-être économique de notre province. En usant de prudence et de bon sens, nous serons en mesure de franchir graduellement et en toute sécurité les étapes de notre stratégie de relance. »
Jason Kenney, premier ministre

La première étape de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta place la sécurité au premier plan tout en levant progressivement les restrictions. Afin de trouver un équilibre entre la sécurité publique et la nécessité d'ouvrir des entreprises et de rétablir les services pour la population, les villes de Calgary et de Brooks connaîtront une réouverture un peu plus progressive, compte tenu du nombre plus élevé de cas dans ces deux communautés.

« Grâce aux sacrifices consentis par les Albertains et les Albertaines, la majeure partie de la province a réussi à aplatir la courbe. Pourtant, je sais que l'idée de relancer notre économie suscite de fortes émotions pour beaucoup d'entre nous. Il est normal de se sentir anxieux, mais nous devons aller de l'avant, pour notre santé et notre bien-être collectif. Achetez seulement ce dont vous avez besoin et ne vous attardez pas pour faire du lèche-vitrine. Prenez les précautions qui s'imposent, restez chez vous si vous êtes malade et veillez les uns sur les autres. Ensemble, nous pouvons réussir à aller de l'avant de manière progressive et réfléchie. »
La Dr Deena Hinshaw, médecin hygiéniste en chef

Grâce à une capacité accrue de dépistage et de recherche de contacts, ainsi qu'à un plan d’intervention rapide en cas d’éclosion, la province est prête à aller de l’avant, progressivement et de façon réfléchie.
Première étape - toutes les régions de l'Alberta, à l'exception des villes de Calgary et de Brooks

Grâce aux mesures de prévention et de contrôle des infections qui visent à minimiser le risque de transmission accrue des infections, les entreprises et installations suivantes peuvent commencer à reprendre leurs activités dès le 14 mai, dans toutes les régions de l’Alberta, à l'exception des villes de Calgary et de Brooks :
	
Les commerces de détail, tels que les boutiques de vêtements, les magasins de meubles et les librairies. Les marchés fermiers pourront également rouvrir;
Les musées et les galeries d'art;
Les garderies et les services de garde en milieu scolaire, mais les places seront limitées;
Les salons de coiffure pour hommes et pour femmes;
Les cafés, restaurants, pubs et bars ne pourront rouvrir pour le service aux tables qu'à 50 % de leur capacité;
Les camps de jour, y compris les cours d'été, seront autorisés, mais les places seront limitées;
Les établissements d'enseignement supérieur continueront à dispenser des cours; il y aura plus de souplesse pour inclure la prestation en personne une fois que l'ordonnance sanitaire actuelle, qui interdit les cours en personne, sera levée;
Les lieux de culte et les services funéraires, s'ils suivent les directives spécifiques affichées en ligne (en anglais seulement);
La reprise progressive de certaines opérations chirurgicales prévues et non urgentes se poursuivra;
Les professionnels de la santé règlementés seront autorisés à offrir des services tant qu’ils continueront à suivre les directives approuvées par leurs ordres professionnels.

La nouvelle page web alberta.ca/bizconnect (en anglais seulement) fournit aux propriétaires d'entreprises des renseignements sur les directives en matière de santé et de sécurité pour les lieux de travail généraux, ainsi que des directives spécifiques à certains secteurs pour ceux qui peuvent rouvrir à la première étape. Les entreprises autorisées à rouvrir au cours de la première étape seront soumises à des mesures strictes de prévention et de contrôle des infections, et elles feront l'objet d'une surveillance attentive pour s'assurer qu'elles respectent les consignes de santé publique établies. Il appartiendra à chaque exploitant de déterminer s'il est prêt à rouvrir et de s'assurer que son établissement respecte toutes les directives.
L’exigence visant l’éloignement physique à un minimum de deux mètres restera en place à toutes les étapes de la relance, et les entreprises et les particuliers devront continuer à pratiquer les mesures d'hygiène imposées. En outre, les Albertains et les Albertaines devront rester chez eux s’ils présentent des symptômes tels que la toux, la fièvre, l'essoufflement, l'écoulement nasal ou le mal de gorge. On encourage également la population à porter un masque non médical dans les lieux publics où il est difficile de garder une distance minimale de deux mètres.

Toutefois, l’éloignement physique est obligatoire et tous les visiteurs doivent porter un masque ou se couvrir le visage autrement;
Les classes en personne, pour les élèves de la maternelle à la douzième année.

Recommandations :

Il n'est pas recommandé de voyager en dehors de la province.
Le télétravail est conseillé dans la mesure du possible.
Encouragez les Albertains et les Albertaines de Calgary et de Brooks à attendre la réouverture de leurs communautés pour accéder aux services plutôt que de se déplacer pour les obtenir.
On encourage la population albertaine à télécharger l'application mobile de recherche de contacts ABTraceTogether (en anglais seulement) et à l'utiliser lorsqu'ils sont en public.

Le passage à la deuxième étape sera déterminé par le succès de la première étape, compte tenu de la capacité du système de santé, des cas d'hospitalisation et des unités de soins intensifs (USI), et des taux d'infection. Pour en savoir davantage, visitez le site alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy (en anglais seulement).
En bref

Les étapes de la relance comprendront une période d'évaluation et de surveillance pour déterminer si les restrictions doivent être adaptées. Les déclencheurs qui éclaireront les décisions relatives à la réduction ou au renforcement des restrictions sont notamment les hospitalisations et l'occupation des unités de soins intensifs (USI).
Les cas confirmés, le pourcentage de résultats positifs et le taux d'infection feront l'objet d'une surveillance continue qui informera les interventions proactives dans des zones localisées de la province.
Les décisions seront appliquées partout dans la province ou dans des zones locales, si nécessaire. Même si les restrictions sont progressivement assouplies dans toute la province, une éclosion pourrait signifier leur renforcement temporaire dans une zone locale particulière.
Les meilleurs moyens que les Albertains et les Albertaines peuvent prendre pour prévenir les maladies respiratoires, y compris la COVID-19, sont de pratiquer l'éloignement physique et une bonne hygiène.
	
Cela implique de se laver les mains régulièrement pendant au moins 20 secondes, d'éviter de se toucher le visage, de tousser ou d'éternuer dans le coude ou sur la manche, et de jeter les mouchoirs à la poubelle.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods (SCAN) unit of the Alberta Sheriffs obtained a court order that took effect at noon on May 13, authorizing them to close the house at 14031 118 Street for 90 days.
Under terms of the community safety order granted by the court, crews boarded up the house, changed the locks and erected a fence around the property. The barriers will remain in place until Aug. 11, and no one is allowed to enter the property during the closure period.

“Law-abiding Albertans deserve to live in safe communities free from drugs and the traffickers that pollute them. Thanks to the SCAN unit, people in this neighbourhood can rest easier. We value the relentless efforts of the SCAN unit and its law enforcement partners who keep Albertans safe, secure and protected.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General

Multiple complaints from the community about drug use and drug trafficking associated with the property sparked the SCAN investigation, which began in October 2019.
SCAN investigators confirmed drug activity was taking place at the property, which is near a community park and an elementary school.

“The fact that drug-related activity was happening near an elementary school and a park make this particularly concerning. Our government will continue to remain vigilant to provide law enforcement with the tools and resources they need to protect vulnerable Albertans from those who would prey on them.”

Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


The recent investigation is the second involving this property. In 2015, SCAN investigators responding to a complaint about drug activity issued a warning letter to the property owner, who is believed to be the sole resident of the house.
In addition to observing criminal activities covered by the Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act, investigators also noted the high volume of people coming and going from the property created an elevated risk of spreading COVID-19 by not following physical distancing recommendations outlined by public health officials.
Due to restrictions on court operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, investigators had to first apply to Court of Queen’s Bench for an emergency hearing before proceeding with a community safety order application.
After being granted an emergency hearing, investigators obtained a community safety order in Edmonton Court of Queen’s Bench on May 5. In addition to barring anyone from the property until Aug. 11, the court order places the property under supervision until May 5, 2021.
The SCAN unit works with other law enforcement agencies to shut down properties being used for illegal activities. The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act gives sheriffs the authority to target problem properties through civil enforcement.
Since its inception in 2008, Alberta’s SCAN unit has investigated more than 5,800 problem properties and issued more than 80 community safety orders. The majority of complaints are resolved by working with property owners to keep criminal activity out of the community.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




With global demand for helium on the rise, industry interest in exploring Alberta’s helium potential is growing. Establishing this new rate – of 4.25 per cent – and structure helps set the stage for investment, while ensuring a fair price for Albertans.
Several companies expressed interest in investing in Alberta’s helium potential, but the lack of a royalty rate has been a disincentive.

“Removing this barrier unlocks the potential to develop helium deposits in southeastern Alberta and sets us up to take advantage of the close proximity to the United States, the world’s largest helium consumer. Economic diversification is an essential part of the province’s recovery efforts and sets a course towards future prosperity.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy

Global demand for helium is growing, in part because of its use in medical imaging, electronics and space exploration.
This effective royalty rate is set for an initial period of five years. At that time, the rate will be reviewed to ensure it remains competitive and allows for any necessary adjustments.
Quick facts

The new royalty rate and structure for helium comes into effect retroactive to April 1.
The helium royalty rate is being established through amendments to two regulations: Natural Gas Royalty Regulation, 2009; and Natural Gas Royalty Regulation, 2017.
Canada has the fifth largest helium reserves in the world.
Saskatchewan is currently the only commercial helium producer in Canada.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Without this agreement, federal rules would remain in effect in the province indefinitely, meaning producers would need to adhere to two sets of overlapping methane reduction rules. Now, the process to stand down federal regulations in Alberta can begin, allowing the province to build on an already excellent history of reducing emissions utilizing local expertise.
The preliminary agreement follows several years of negotiations and confirms Alberta’s regulatory framework will achieve the same emissions reductions as the federal regulation by 2025. Further, the provincial approach is expected to exceed the reductions of the federal regulation by 2030. The flexibility and innovation allowed in Alberta’s regulatory framework means industry can achieve emissions reductions in a more cost-effective manner and with more certainty around the regulatory process.

“This agreement represents further proof that environmental and economic outcomes go hand in hand. It is a further testament to Alberta’s strong tradition of regulatory excellence and another successful example of the province retaining our own jurisdiction over our regulatory processes. Our large industries have consistently demonstrated that emissions reduction can be achieved through innovation and we will continue to support this approach.”

Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks



“As we make plans for economic recovery and set a course for our province’s future prosperity, it is critical for industry to have the regulatory certainty needed to operate and further invest in Alberta. This preliminary agreement will give Alberta the ability to achieve methane emission reductions through one of the strongest regulatory systems in the world.”

Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy



“The preliminary agreement is good news for Alberta’s oil and natural gas producers. It will reduce the administrative burden on companies and give them a single framework for tackling methane emissions when the agreement is finalized. The provincial framework supports a flexible, results-oriented approach to reducing emissions while stimulating technology and innovation essential to meeting our environmental performance goals at this critical time. CAPP believes provincial regulators are best positioned to ensure efficient and effective regulation of methane emissions. We also see intergovernmental collaboration to reduce regulatory duplication as critical to both environmental performance and economic recovery. Our country has some of the most stringent regulatory standards for methane emissions and our upstream oil and natural gas industry remains committed to achieving the federal methane emissions reduction targets.”
Tim McMillan, president and CEO, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers


“We’re very pleased to see the Government of Alberta is working with the federal government to streamline regulations, especially now when administrative and financial resources are at all-time lows. A single and clear set of rules for methane reduction will allow our industry to do what it does best, meet and beat expectations with world-class people and technology.”
Mark A. Scholz, president & CEO, Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors


“PSAC is pleased that a preliminary equivalency agreement on methane has been reached. Reducing the burden of compliance given the difficulty of complying with two sets of regulations is critical to controlling costs in this globally competitive industry. The oilfield services sector that PSAC represents is instrumental in developing new technologies and innovation. We look forward to continuing to work with governments on driving the innovation that creates urgently needed jobs for the oilfield services sector and to facilitate continued positive environmental outcomes that demonstrate Canada’s commitment to responsible energy development.”
Elizabeth Aquin, president and CEO, Petroleum Services Association of Canada

The preliminary agreement will require a legislated review process and approval by federal cabinet. This includes Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) posting the preliminary agreement for a 60-day comment period. After responding to the public comments received, ECCC will finalize the agreement with an order in council.
During this review period, the federal regulations will remain in effect in Alberta. Once the order in council is approved, the federal regulation will no longer apply in the province.      
Quick facts

On Jan. 1, 2020, both federal and provincial rules took effect in Alberta.
To align with details of the draft equivalency agreement, Alberta has made revisions to the Alberta Energy Regulator’s Directives 060 and 017.
Alberta’s Methane Emissions Reduction Regulation provides residents the right to request an investigation if they believe a company is not complying with methane reduction requirements.
In 2014, the baseline year to measure reductions, an estimated 31.4 megatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent of methane was emitted from Alberta’s upstream oil and gas sector.
The Alberta approach is expected to reduce methane emissions by 45 per cent from 2014 levels by 2025.
Methane’s environmental impact is 25 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period.
Work with the federal government also continues on Canada’s Clean Fuel Standard. The federal government has pushed back implementation by six months due to COVID-19, allowing opportunities to further explore regulatory impacts.

SR1 will provide flood mitigation along the Elbow River to protect southern Alberta and Calgary from future flood events. Budget 2020 includes a commitment of $196.3 million over three years. The project is currently moving through the federal and provincial regulatory process.

“Our government remains committed to moving the Springbank dam through the regulatory process as quickly as possible to ensure that Calgary and southern Alberta have necessary flood mitigation in place before the next major flood event occurs. The residents of southern Alberta and the province’s economy cannot handle another major flood, which is why Budget 2020 includes funding to move SR1 forward. I am pleased with the work my department is doing on this important project and we will continue engaging with stakeholders, First Nations partners and other impacted groups to address their concerns about the project.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation

Flood mitigation continues to be a top priority for the government. SR1 is one part of an overall southern Alberta flood mitigation strategy that includes projects such as the Bow River flood mitigation project and enhancements to the Glenmore Reservoir, which were completed this spring.
Last year, the Government of Alberta appointed independent expert Martin Ignasiak to review the status of the regulatory process and to find ways to accelerate the project’s construction. The report is available online.
Quick facts

The total estimated cost of the SR1 project is $432 million.
Government has purchased about 25 per cent of the required land.
SR1 requires approval from the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (IAAC), Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP) and the Natural Resource Conservation Board (NRCB).
Following regulatory approval, SR1 would take two years to build to a functional one-in-100-year capacity, and three years to build to full completion (capacity of the 2013 flood).

Reallocating money from the Community Initiatives Program Project-based grant to the Community Initiatives Program Operating grant will help struggling front-line charities and non-profits maintain their core operations and provide services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Front-line charities and non-profits are doing incredible work to support our communities during COVID-19. Our government recognizes the unprecedented challenges they are facing and stand by them as they care for Albertans. Reallocating funding through the Community Initiatives Program directs dollars to where they are needed most urgently.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women

The May and September intakes of the Community Initiatives Program Operating grant will be combined into one intake in June to help flow much-needed dollars to front-line organizations faster. Funding for this one-time intake will be prioritized for small and medium-sized organizations that focus on food security, shelter and housing, and addictions and mental health supports so they can continue to care for vulnerable Albertans.
This approach to supporting the sector will be followed until there is a better understanding of timelines for COVID-19 and when the recovery phase will begin.
Applicants are encouraged to check the Community Grants website for program information and intake updates.
Quick facts

The program will provide $8 million in funding.
The limit for Community Initiatives Program Operating grant requests will be increased from $60,000 to $75,000.
The three-year eligibility period for the Community Initiatives Program will be waived to allow all organizations in need of operational funding to apply for this one-time intake.
The January 2020 Community Initiatives Program Operating intake is being reviewed for funding. Applicants for this grant will be notified in May regarding grant decisions.

Quick facts

The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.


Any individual exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. People can access testing by completing the COVID-19 self-assessment online. A separate self-assessment tool is available for health-care and shelter workers, enforcement and first responders. After completing the form, there is no need to call 811.
All Albertans need to work together to overcome COVID-19. Albertans are asked to share acts of kindness they have experienced in their community during this difficult time by using the hashtag #AlbertaCares.

Editor's note: The number of active cases has been corrected.

“The Government of Alberta appreciates today’s announcement from the federal government, which responds to our repeated advocacy over the last two months to ensure a future for Canada’s largest employers during this time of extraordinary adversity.
 
“Over the past 10 years, Alberta has contributed almost $200 billion to the country in net fiscal transfers. A significant amount of this wealth was contributed by large employers in our province. That’s why it was important the federal government step up and provide bridge financing as required to challenged, but otherwise viable, businesses in the province.  
 
“In particular, we thank Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Finance Minister Bill Morneau for their work on this critically important file.
 
“Today’s news, in combination with earlier measures for small and medium-sized companies, represents an expression of confidence in industries that have been gravely damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic and its related economic consequences.
 
“Alberta employers have long factored in environmental considerations to their business planning and reporting. We will closely watch to ensure that Ottawa’s conditions do not unnecessarily impair accessibility, future growth and prosperity.
 
“We will continue to work with our largest employers and the Government of Canada to ensure that these programs are accessible, timely, and efficient in these difficult times.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.





“The natural disasters and economic hardships that have been endured by the residents of northern Alberta have mental health implications. I want folks in these communities to know that Alberta is here for them. Enhanced support is now available to ensure residents have timely access to mental health and addiction recovery services during these tough times. We will get through this together.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“The people of northern Alberta have faced a series of enormous challenges in the last several years – wildfire, economic downturn, flooding and a pandemic. The cumulative effect of these difficulties can be mentally and emotionally overwhelming. Our government wants to ensure Albertans have the support needed to restore their homes, their lives and their well-being.’’
Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions

With one-time funding of $500,000 provided by the Government of Alberta, Alberta Health Services will create additional mental health capacity in Fort McMurray and Fort Vermilion.
Additional supports include staff qualified to provide psychiatric, nursing and social work support, as well as recovery from addiction in Fort McMurray. This team will work in the community, providing assessment and treatment to individuals with mental health and addiction concerns, as well as coordinating community support. This will include working with RCMP and other community services. Addiction and mental health staffing will also be increased in Fort Vermilion to support residents in that community.

“Dealing with flooded homes and businesses at the height of a pandemic has placed incredible demands upon the residents of this region – residents who have already endured a devastating fire and an economic downturn. This enhanced mental health support will help individuals and families who have already dealt with so much.”
Tany Yao, MLA for Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo


“These mental health services will provide the people of this region with much-needed additional support. I encourage those affected by the loss and destruction of recent flooding to seek mental health support if you are feeling overwhelmed or are struggling. Please know that you don’t need to face these hardships alone; others are available to listen and to help.”
Laila Goodridge, MLA for Fort McMurray-Lac La Biche


“Recent flooding was an unexpected and unwelcome addition to the stresses already created by a global health pandemic. These enhanced mental health services will support residents doing their best to cope during these extraordinary times. I urge residents of the region to acknowledge when they are feeling overwhelmed and to reach out for help.”
Dan Williams, MLA for Peace River

“The theme of this year’s National Nursing Week is ‘Nurses: A Voice to Lead – Nursing the World to Health.’
“That theme takes on new meaning as nurses help the world respond to the global coronavirus emergency. Here in Alberta, valiant nurses on the front line risk their own health to do their vital work of healing in every community.
“International Nurses Day takes place during National Nursing Week. This year, the day celebrates the 200th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale, the courageous British woman who pioneered modern nursing. She placed patients at the centre of her approach to care. Her fundamental commitment, revolutionary in its day, is now the basis of nursing practice the world over, and certainly here in Alberta.  
“Whether they are registered nurses, nurse practitioners, registered psychiatric nurses or licensed practical nurses, these women and men are an indispensable part of Alberta’s health-care system. We celebrate their dedication.
“To all who are doing their duty as nurses in our province at this extraordinary time – and at all times – thank you, on behalf of all Albertans, for your devoted and caring service.
“Happy National Nursing Week.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Through a two-year $43 million pilot project, the Alberta government has approved the Alberta Recycling Management Authority (ARMA) to use reserve funds to recycle up to 24,600 tonnes of electronics products that were not accepted previously in the program.

“An expanded electronics program has the potential to inject $30 million annually into Alberta’s economy and support 360 additional full-time jobs in the recycling sector. These new jobs will come from increased demand for electronics collection and transportation, as well as jobs associated with processing and manufacturing the recycled material into new goods. ARMA has a strong record already, and recently hit a major milestone of 10 million electronic products recycled in Alberta. This expansion will help us recycle even more.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

Municipalities will receive funding for collecting the additional electronics included in the recycling expansion. Currently, municipalities do not receive compensation to manage electronics that are outside ARMA’s existing program.

“The Alberta Urban Municipalities Association is encouraged to see the Government of Alberta moving forward with an expanded electronics recycling pilot project. This project will be a welcome opportunity for our urban municipalities. It allows our members to be part of the continuum of returning end-of-life products to the manufacturing process.”
Cathy Heron, board member, Alberta Urban Municipalities Association


“Municipalities play an important role in enabling and supporting recycling programs across Alberta. The electronics recycling pilot project will enable Albertans to continue to be good environmental stewards and is responsive to ongoing requests to effectively recycle more products. Municipalities look forward to playing a continued role in this pilot project and the long-term objective to permanently expand our electronics recycle program.” 
Al Kemmere, president, Rural Municipalities of Alberta

The expanded electronics recycling products include: audio visual equipment, telecom, cell phone and wireless devices, electronic gaming equipment, small home appliances, portable power tools, toys, musical instruments and solar panels. There will be no cost to consumers to recycle the additional products during the pilot.

“We are excited for the many opportunities and benefits an expanded electronics recycling program could bring to Alberta’s burgeoning circular economy while continuing to contribute to the global effort to reuse and reduce waste. We’re confident we can do this because Albertans are our biggest champions and demonstrate on a daily basis a strong culture for recycling.”
Ed Gugenheimer, chief executive officer, Alberta Recycling Management Authority

An expanded program would also divert up to an additional 12,300 tonnes –the equivalent weight of 8,785 average cars – from landfills annually.

“Hi Tech Recyclers is eager and ready to ramp our facility operations to process what we expect to be nearly double the present volume of electronics recycling. This comes as welcome relief during uncertain times with COVID-19 and the impacts it has had on our economy and the many lives of Albertans who are now unemployed. Beyond our ability to provide more direct and indirect jobs through an expanded electronics recycling program is the fact that this announcement from the province means we are one step closer to keeping all electronics out of the local and global waste stream.”
Mark Schell, president, Hi Tech Recyclers


“At eCycle, we are very pleased to see Alberta take the necessary steps to protect the environment and keep more electronics out of landfills. We have a long history in Alberta and look forward to the future and working with the great Alberta municipalities to create new jobs and continue serving Albertans.”
Scott Loughran, vice-president of operations, eCycle Solutions Inc.

Recycling and waste management are essential services in Alberta during the pandemic. Municipal and collection sites remain open and Albertans are encouraged to practise physical distancing when bringing their recycling to collection sites.
Many collection sites have implemented COVID-19 mitigation measures and continue to manage electronics recyclables. In fact, the project could help offset other waste products currently destined for landfills as a result of the pandemic’s impact on reduced sorting capacity at some municipal sorting facilities.
The pilot will inform the possibility of a permanently expanded electronics program. ARMA will conduct community and stakeholder engagement prior to launching the two-year pilot.
Quick facts

The current electronics program accepts display devices, desktop computers, portable computers, computer peripherals, desktop printers/multi-function devices, desktop and portable scanners, fax machines, floor-standing photocopiers/multi-function devices.
ARMA operates provincial recycling programs for oil, tires, paint and electronics.
In 2018, the Alberta recycling sector’s annual economic value was estimated at $700 million in gross value add (GVA) and created more than 7,500 direct, indirect and induced jobs, from which $180 million and 1,570 jobs are attributed to ARMA specific programs.
Of the $180 million in GVA the industry injects into Alberta’s economy, about $50 million and 400 full-time equivalent jobs are attributed to ARMA’s current electronics recycling program.
There are currently 365 municipal electronics collection sites throughout the province.  
96 per cent of Albertans live no further than a 20-minute drive to an electronics collection site.
Alberta set up Canada’s first end-of-life electronics recycling program in 2004.

“The right to peaceful protest is a fundamental right that includes both the freedoms of speech and assembly.
We understand that a number of peaceful protests have occurred outside the legislature since a public health emergency was invoked, where protestors observed physical distancing guidelines largely without incident. Yesterday was the first time an arrest occurred.
“Elected leaders do not direct operational decisions of law enforcement officials. We are inquiring why an arrest occurred yesterday, but not at previous protests. If we are not satisfied with the explanation, the government will modify public health orders to clarify that it is acceptable for individuals who are respecting physical distancing guidelines to be present in outdoor public venues, including for the purpose of protesting.
“We recognize that law enforcement is dealing with a situation without precedent during this pandemic. At the same time, we expect that law enforcement will exercise common sense in respecting both fundamental rights and protecting public health.”

“During this time, a police officer’s courage takes on a special dimension as they continue their work in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. I thank them for taking on additional enforcement duties that keep all of us safe from this new threat.
“This 50th National Police Week, I urge everyone – when you see a police officer at work – to give them a wave, a smile and a thumbs-up. Show that we appreciate all the work they do to keep us safe, protect us from violence and uphold justice.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Members will focus on issues related to student transportation, including student safety, costs, eligibility, partner collaboration and the responsibilities of school authorities and industry partners. Their scope of work will cover busing for students attending publicly funded schools in urban and rural communities. Members will also consider various service delivery models and services for students with disabilities when developing their recommendations.
Members have agreed to participate in this committee during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the importance of the work. The task force will meet virtually until further notice.

“We committed to improving and modernizing the education system in Alberta. Student transportation is an integral part of the system that needs further attention to address the challenges facing our partners who deliver this service. I have asked this task force to explore options, while putting Albertans’ safety first due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They will provide their best advice on how the system can be improved, become more efficient and become more cost-effective in serving Alberta’s students.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

Alberta Education officials met with school authorities across the province when developing the new education funding model for the 2020-21 school year. During these consultations, it became clear that student transportation needed further conversations and review.

“The safety of students, families and drivers on Alberta’s roads and highways is my top priority. Collaboration is at the heart of this initiative, and I am proud that my department will play a part in ensuring students are transported to and from school as safely as possible.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation

Lethbridge-East MLA Nathan Neudorf will chair the task force. Joining him on the team are Grande Prairie MLA Tracy Allard, Brooks-Medicine Hat MLA Michaela Glasgo, Drumheller-Stettler MLA Nate Horner and Calgary-South East MLA Matt Jones.
The task force also includes 13 members from the student transportation industry, community partners and key education partner organizations. They will be supported by officials from Alberta Education and Alberta Transportation.

“A key component of the elementary and secondary student experience in Alberta is the transportation services we provide to them. The reliability and efficiency of busing systems has a significant impact on student engagement in rural and urban areas. There is ample opportunity to improve the current student transportation system; I am thrilled to begin exploring ways through this committee that we can improve this often understated but crucial service.”
Nathan Neudorf, MLA for Lethbridge-East, and chair, student transportation task force


“Pacific Western Transportation is proud to be part of the Alberta government’s Student Transportation Task Force. We look forward to collaborating with all stakeholders in the review of Alberta’s student transportation system, and will be guided by our core values and safely home promise.”
Jonathan Weal, director of business development, Pacific Western Transportation (Southland Transportation)


“The Alberta School Boards Association appreciates the opportunity to provide input and direction to the student transportation system. School board representation is critical, as they understand the complex needs that differ between urban, metro and rural boards, while representing the full community.

Student Transportation Task Force




Un nouveau groupe de travail a été créé pour formuler des recommandations sur l'avenir du transport scolaire dans la province.
Les membres se pencheront sur les questions liées au transport scolaire, telles que la sécurité des élèves, les couts, l'admissibilité, la collaboration entre les partenaires et les responsabilités des autorités scolaires et des partenaires du secteur. Leur travail portera sur le transport par autobus des élèves qui fréquentent les écoles publiques des communautés urbaines et rurales. Lors de l'élaboration de leurs recommandations, les membres examineront également divers modèles de prestation de services et les services offerts aux étudiants handicapés.
Étant donné l'importance de ce travail, les membres ont accepté de participer à ce comité pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Le groupe de travail se réunira donc virtuellement jusqu'à nouvel ordre.

« Nous nous sommes engagés à améliorer et à moderniser le système d’éducation de l’Alberta. Le transport scolaire fait partie intégrante de ce système et doit faire l'objet d'une plus grande attention si nous voulons relever les défis auxquels font face nos partenaires qui fournissent ce service. J'ai demandé à ce groupe de travail d'explorer toutes les options, en mettant la sécurité des Albertaines et des Albertains au premier plan en cette pandémie de COVID-19. Les membres du groupe donneront leurs recommandations sur la manière d'améliorer le système, et de le rendre plus efficace et plus rentable pour servir les élèves de l'Alberta. »
Adriana LaGrange, ministre de l’Éducation

Les responsables du ministère de l'Éducation ont rencontré les autorités scolaires des quatre coins de la province lors de l'élaboration du nouveau modèle de financement de l'éducation pour l'année scolaire 2020-2021. Au cours de ces consultations, il est devenu évident que le transport scolaire devait faire l'objet de discussions et d'un examen plus approfondis.

« La sécurité des élèves, des familles et des conducteurs qui circulent sur les routes et les autoroutes de l'Alberta est ma priorité absolue. La collaboration est au cœur de cette initiative et je suis fier du rôle que jouera mon ministère pour assurer la sécurité des élèves à l’aller et au retour de l'école. »
Ric McIver, ministre des Transports

Le groupe de travail comprend également 13 membres issus du secteur du transport scolaire, des partenaires communautaires et des principales organisations partenaires de l’éducation. Ces personnes seront appuyées par des fonctionnaires des ministères de l’Éducation et du Transport.

« Le service de transport que nous fournissons est un élément fondamental de l'expérience des élèves du primaire et du secondaire en Alberta. La fiabilité et l'efficacité des systèmes de transport par autobus ont une grande incidence sur l’intérêt des élèves dans les zones rurales et urbaines. Il existe de nombreuses façons d'améliorer le système actuel de transport scolaire et je suis ravi de commencer à explorer, par l'intermédiaire de ce comité, les moyens d'améliorer ce service souvent sous-estimé, mais essentiel. »

Nous sommes impatients de travailler en collaboration avec le gouvernement et les parties prenantes afin de prioriser la sécurité des élèves et d'assurer un meilleur système de transport. »
Lorrie Jess, présidente de l’Alberta School Boards Association


« Notre système de transport scolaire actuel subit des pressions importantes qui perturbent l’efficacité des services fournis aux élèves des milieux urbains et ruraux, ainsi qu’à ceux et celles qui ont des besoins particuliers. Le College of Alberta School Superintendents est reconnaissant d'avoir été invité à recommander des personnes pour faire partie de ce comité.

The first week in May, Alberta Infrastructure and Alberta Transportation together announced $426 million in capital maintenance and renewal funding to accelerate repairs and improvements that will support over 3200 jobs. Government is quadrupling this year’s budget for pothole repairs and other critical safety-related activities by adding $60 million provincewide, which will support another 360 jobs.

“Every project is an investment in the future of a community and its families. These projects add to everyone’s quality of life over the long-term while they provide good, well-paying jobs that will help Albertans feed their families and pay the bills.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure


“Every region of the province has felt the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the collapse of energy prices. Road maintenance work will keep companies moving, extend the life of our infrastructure and provide more value for taxpayers. We are doing everything we can to get Albertans back to work, and these projects will create thousands of good jobs for Albertans in the short term while improving driving conditions and ensuring our important transportation corridors are ready to support the province’s businesses and job creators, once the economy recovers.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation

Any individual exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing.

CORE – Collaborative Online Resources and Education – provides a platform for seniors-serving organizations to improve delivery of services for seniors. The hub will make it easier for organizations to share resources and coordinate services, with a focus on key COVID-19 issues, including transportation, food security, social isolation and home supports.
CORE Alberta will support seniors-serving organizations to access training, COVID-19 information and resources, map where the greatest needs are across the province, and help seniors in more remote locations get the support they need.
The online hub cost $40,000 to develop. The Alberta government and partners will invest about $720,000 in inter-agency programs and initiatives that will be coordinated through CORE. Funding partners include Alberta Health Services, Alberta Blue Cross and the federal government. The United Way of Calgary and Area will administer the hub and act as the project’s fiscal agent.

“We are using this technology to better serve Alberta seniors. Older individuals are among those most at-risk for COVID-19. We believe the online knowledge hub will enhance the way organizations support seniors during the pandemic, and help keep them safe as we move forward with our relaunch plans.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“The Government of Canada is proud to support the adoption of United Way’s CORE knowledge hub together with the Government of Alberta. By helping community organizations coordinate their services for seniors, this platform will help ensure more seniors in Alberta receive effective, responsive support. That has never been more important than during the pandemic. We are committed to protecting and enhancing seniors’ quality of life.”
Deb Schulte, Minister of Seniors


“There are a variety of resources that exist in the community to support seniors. Sometimes they are hard to find, so we are pleased CORE is coordinating these resources, making them accessible in one single location to provide an easy way for Alberta seniors to access information they need to improve wellness, independence, and quality of life.”
Dr. Richard Lewanczuk, senior medical director, Health System Integration, Alberta Health Services


“In the midst of the pandemic and public health measures such as social distancing, helping our seniors maintain connections to health care and community resources is critical. As an organization that interacts with over 640,000 Alberta seniors, Alberta Blue Cross is so pleased to be supporting this initiative.”
Mark Komlenic, president and CEO, Alberta Blue Cross


“We are thrilled to be a part of the collaborative effort to connect organizations serving seniors in Alberta with the resources they need to not only help seniors remain safe during the pandemic by connecting them to valuable services in their area, but also to support their full and meaningful participation in their communities long term.”
Karen Young, president and CEO, United Way Calgary and Area,
Rob Yager, president and CEO, United Way of the Alberta Capital Region

CORE Alberta will feature:

Online forums to access training, share resources and promote best practices.
A link to Alberta 211 for seniors seeking direct supports.
Information about volunteer safety, protocols and guidelines.
Links to funding opportunities and resources to address challenges related to COVID-19.

Over the last year, Sage Seniors Association, carya, Age-Friendly Calgary and Edmonton Seniors Co-ordinating Council worked with more than 160 seniors-serving organizations across Alberta to develop the platform.
CORE Alberta will also coordinate with Family and Community Support Services to build on government’s $30-million investment to support seniors and vulnerable Albertans.

“The sacrifices moms make at the best of times are amazing, but during these especially tough times, it's above and beyond the call that many mothers are going to with the schools closed, many daycares shut down, and children anxious with the coronavirus and so much else.
“And we just want to say to all of the parents, especially moms today: thank you for what you do. 
“Let's also have a special thought today for moms and grandmas who are in long-term care and seniors residences, some of whom might be feeling especially alone or vulnerable these days. 
“Let's reach out and show them some love today and to thank them for being the heroes in all of our families.

At about 8:15 a.m., Royal Canadian Mounted Police responded to a gun complaint at a residence in Blackfalds. A man armed with a gun fired shots from the residence, seriously injuring one woman. No shots were fired by police at this location. The man exited the residence and fled the area, operating a black BMW sedan.
The vehicle was located travelling northbound on the QEII Highway, and a brief pursuit ensued. RCMP deployed a tire deflation device, damaging the tires on the fleeing vehicle but not immediately rendering it inoperable. The BMW sedan crossed the median and began travelling northbound in the southbound lanes of traffic on QEII.
While ASIRT’s investigation continues, available Watchguard video from a marked RCMP vehicle confirms that the BMW sedan stopped on the highway near Leduc, with police vehicles surrounding it. The 27-year-old man was the vehicle’s lone occupant. He exited the vehicle armed with a firearm, which he immediately raised and pointed at police. Both the man and police officers briefly exchanged gunfire.
The man sustained injuries and fell to the ground. An RCMP officer also sustained serious injuries. Officers on scene provided emergency medical assistance to both the man and the injured officer, but the man was pronounced dead on scene. The injured officer was transported to a hospital in Edmonton. He was admitted and treated and has since been released.
The man’s firearm, a 12-gauge, semi-automatic, tactical-style shotgun was recovered from the incident location.
 
A semi-automatic, tactical-style shotgun was recovered from the scene of the incident.

ASIRT is asking members of the public who may have witnessed the events that occurred on QEII near the Highway 2A overpass, and/or may have any additional video or audio recordings of the incident that have not been already been provided to RCMP, to contact ASIRT investigators at 780-644-1483.
With ASIRT’s investigation underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

The new Disaster Recovery Program will provide financial support to residents and business owners for uninsurable damages, as well as help restore municipal infrastructure.

“The devastation caused by the flooding we saw in Fort McMurray and throughout the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo and Mackenzie County has impacted thousands of lives, washing away priceless memories and losing the security of your home or business. These immense challenges are only made worse by the ongoing pandemic, and I know that many people are overwhelmed and worried for the future. I want to tell you that your government is here for you. All of Alberta is here for you and, together, we will get through this and rebuild.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“We understand the challenges northern Alberta is facing right now and we are committed to providing the support the region needs to rebuild and recover from these floods. Dealing with this disaster amid a pandemic makes this situation uniquely challenging, but the people of northern Alberta are determined and strong. We will be there to support them, and their local leaders, in their rebuilding efforts.”
Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs


“Today’s announcement from the Government of Alberta is great news in support of our community and the people impacted by this historic flood. While we are just beginning our path to recovery, this commitment demonstrates how Albertans always come together to help each other during challenging times. We thank Premier Kenney, Minister Madu and our MLAs for their timely support to our residents when it is needed most. Fort McMurray and our region has persevered before and we will once again.”
Don Scott, mayor, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo


“Our community of Fort Vermilion has experienced a devastating event and lives have been turned upside down. Cleanup efforts are underway with many organizations and volunteer groups stepping up to help our residents. We thank Premier Kenney, Minister Madu, our local MLA Dan Williams, and the rest of the provincial government for providing financial support to the municipality and the affected residents in this great time of need, through the Disaster Recovery Program.”
Josh Knelsen, reeve, Mackenzie County

The recent warm temperatures and ice jams in northern Alberta caused overland flooding and sewer backup, forcing more than 14,000 Albertans from their homes. Most have been allowed to return home, but more than 3,000 remain displaced due to significant damages to their property. 

“I’m grateful that even in the midst of an unprecedented global health emergency our government is committing significant resources to help Fort McMurray get back on its feet. Today’s announcement recognizes the importance of our city and our region to the rest of the province, and I want to thank the Premier and the rest of cabinet for getting this program in place so quickly. We are Fort McMurray Strong.”
Laila Goodridge, MLA for Fort McMurray-Lac La Biche


“Our region has faced many challenges in recent years, and I am grateful to the Premier and cabinet for recognizing the impact this flood has had, and moving so quickly to put this Disaster Recovery Program in place. This funding will allow us to rebuild and move on.”
Tany Yao, MLA for Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo


“This Disaster Recovery Program comes as welcome news for Mackenzie County. Northern Alberta has been through a lot, and this funding will ensure we can recover and rebuild after this latest flooding event. I am proud to represent a government that will be there for families and businesses in their time of need.”
Dan Williams, MLA for Peace River

Disaster Recovery Program
The Disaster Recovery Program helps communities recover from undue hardship as a result of an extraordinary disaster. In order to be considered extraordinary, the disaster must meet certain criteria, such as a one-in-100-year event relating to rainfall, streamflow, ice jams, overland flood, wildfire or strong winds.
Homeowners, tenants, small businesses and agricultural operations are eligible to apply for funding that will go towards cleanup costs and repairing uninsurable damage to infrastructure and buildings.
How to apply for financial assistance for your home or property
Funding is available to communities to help those affected recover and rebuild following a disaster.
If your community is approved for a Disaster Recovery Program and you are eligible to receive funding, you can use the online application portal and submit your application beginning on May 11. To apply, or for more information on Disaster Recovery Programs and approvals, visit: alberta.ca/disaster-recovery-programs.aspx.
For municipalities outside of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo and Mackenzie County, the hydrological data required to create a Disaster Recovery Program is not yet available and no decision has been made regarding the eligibility of these communities.
How to apply for emergency evacuation payments
Evacuees in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo and Mackenzie County affected by spring flooding can apply online for emergency evacuation payments at: alberta.ca/emergency. To date, government has provided more than 7,400 Albertans with emergency evacuation payments totalling nearly $8 million.

The program is intended to offset costs for COVID-19 safety and training, including the costs for personal protective equipment and to remove any barriers to get Albertans safely working.

“To all Albertans interested in work, jobs in the agriculture sector are dynamic, employ a range of skillsets and help to support your communities. These investments, provided by both levels of Government, will give Albertans the opportunity to train and transition into these rewarding jobs.”
The Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food

By providing up to $5 million in support to farmers, agri-businesses and food processors, the program helps offset the cost to train new employees safely in new agri-food roles. The program will support training for as many as 2,500 new jobs in Alberta.

“Alberta’s agriculture and food sector rely on thousands of people working every day to help keep food on our tables. As we see record high unemployment in Alberta due to a global economic slowdown and COVID-19, we need to ensure unemployed Albertans have the opportunity for domestic jobs instead of hiring workers from overseas.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

The maximum government contribution under the program is $2,000 per new employee, up to a maximum of $50,000 per employer. Grants will be administered on a first-come, first-served basis until available program funding is fully allocated.
About $1 million of the funding will be targeted for meat processors to provide support for new hires to undertake meat-cutting training.

“Training will provide Albertans with the skills they need to find work and support the province’s agriculture employers. This new program will connect Albertans with new job opportunities so they can get back to work.”
Jason Copping, Minister of Labour and Immigration

As part of the Canadian Agricultural Partnership Risk Management programs, this program will improve the agriculture and agri-food sector’s ability to anticipate, mitigate and prepare for risks that could have a major financial impact on the livestock and plant industries, or affect human health and safety.
Alberta is partnering with the Government of Canada to provide employment support programs and services through the Labour and Immigration’s Workforce Development Agreement and through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership. This program is administered by Alberta Agriculture and Forestry.
This job training support complements the launch of Alberta’s Agriculture Job Connector, a web resource to help agriculture employers looking for workers connect with job seekers.
Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance physical distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are also in place to help Alberta families and businesses.
Quick facts

Program support is targeted to agricultural, meat processing and horticultural businesses and services on the Government of Alberta’s essential service list (with the exception of aquaculture).
Applications will be accepted via the existing Canadian Agricultural Partnership website.
The Partnership is a five-year, $3-billion commitment by Canada's federal, provincial and territorial governments to support Canada's agriculture and agri-food sectors.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Service Alberta’s Consumer Investigations Unit (CIU) first learned of the business by an anonymous tip received through its Report a Rip-Off line.
A CIU investigator went to CCA Logistics Ltd (Newsway) on April 1 and found several pieces of personal protection equipment (PPE) items, as well as other items, being sold at prices that grossly exceeded their normal selling price. Examples included:

3M masks - $120 (400 per cent markup)
Hand sanitizer - $39 (200 per cent markup)
Vitamin C (two-pack) - $30 (100 per cent markup)
Hand soap - $10 (300 per cent markup)
Lysol spray - $25 (250 per cent markup)


“We have been very clear that taking advantage of Albertans is unacceptable and reprehensible, especially during a public health emergency. As customers, Albertans should be able to shop with confidence, without needing to worry about businesses engaging in acts of piracy. Unnecessarily hiking prices by 200 and 400 per cent is disgusting behaviour that will be punished 100 per cent of the time. Our Consumer Investigation Unit does excellent work and will continue to investigate complaints, file charges and prosecute where necessary, with our government’s full support.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta

An interim director’s order was issued to the business owner on April 15, ordering the business to stop charging a price for goods that grossly exceeded a price for which similar goods were available. The business did not comply.
The business owner is scheduled to appear in provincial court in Calgary on Aug. 19.
Quick facts

As of May 8, CIU has received 458 complaints about price gouging related to COVID-19 at businesses across Alberta and 351 have been forwarded for further inspection or investigation.
Price gouging has been alleged across the province on the following consumer products:
	
Hand sanitizer
Lysol/Clorox Wipes
Toilet paper
Face masks (including some N95s)
Disposable gloves
Soup
Flour
Milk
Baby formula
Shredded cheese
Ground beef


The CIU reviews each complaint and will initiate an investigation if there is clear evidence of price gouging. If found guilty, a company could face fines up to $300,000.
If consumers encounter a price that seems unreasonable, they can contact the Report a Rip-Off line at 1-877-427-4088, or file a consumer complaint online at alberta.ca/file-consumer-complaint.aspx.

Le gouvernement a accusé une entreprise de Calgary d'avoir ignoré un ordre de cesser de facturer des prix exorbitants pour plusieurs produits de consommation.
La Consumer Investigations Unit (CIU) de Service Alberta a été mise au courant des activités de l'entreprise grâce à appel anonyme au service téléphonique Report a Rip-Off.
Un enquêteur de la CIU s'est rendu à la CCA Logistics Ltd (Newsway) le 1er avril pour y réaliser que plusieurs articles d'équipement de protection individuelle (EPI), entre autres, étaient vendus à des prix qui dépassaient largement leur prix de vente normal. En voici quelques exemples :

Masques 3M - 120 $ (majoration de 400 %)
Désinfectant pour les mains - 39 $ (majoration de 200 %)
Vitamine C (paquet de deux bouteilles) - 30 $ (majoration de 100 %)
Savon pour les mains - 10 $ (majoration de 300 %)
Désinfectant en aérosol Lysol - 25 $ (majoration de 250 %)


« Nous avons été très clairs sur le fait que nous jugeons inacceptable et répréhensible de profiter de la population albertaine, tout particulièrement en situation d'urgence de santé publique. Les clients albertains devraient pouvoir faire leurs achats en toute confiance, sans avoir à s'inquiéter du fait que des entreprises pourraient se livrer à des actes d’escroquerie. Augmenter inutilement les prix de 200 % et de 400 % est un comportement dégoûtant qui sera puni systématiquement. Notre unité d'enquête fait un excellent travail et elle continuera à enquêter sur les plaintes, de même qu’à porter des accusations et à engager des poursuites, si nécessaire, avec le plein appui de notre gouvernement. »
Nate Glubish, ministre de Service Alberta

Le 15 avril, un ordre provisoire du directeur a été donné au propriétaire de l'entreprise, l’obligeant à cesser de facturer un prix qui dépassait largement celui d’articles similaires. L'entreprise ne s'est pas conformée à cet ordre.
Le propriétaire de l'entreprise devra comparaître devant le tribunal provincial de Calgary le 19 août prochain.
En bref

En date du 8 mai, le SDI avait reçu 458 plaintes concernant des prix abusifs liés à la COVID-19 dans des entreprises de l'Alberta; 351 de ces plaintes mèneront à des inspections ou feront l’objet d’une enquête plus approfondie.
Des accusations de majoration des prix ont été portées dans toute la province pour les produits de consommation suivants :
	
Désinfectant pour les mains
Lingettes Lysol/Clorox
Papier de toilette
Masques faciaux (y compris les masques de type N95)
Gants jetables
Soupe
Farine
Lait
Préparations pour nourrissons
Fromage râpé
Bœuf haché


La CIU examine chaque plainte et ouvrira une enquête s'il existe des preuves évidentes de fraude. Les entreprises reconnues coupables pourraient se voir infliger une amende pouvant aller jusqu'à 300 000 dollars.
Les consommateurs qui se voient proposer des prix qui leur semblent déraisonnables peuvent contacter la ligne Report a Rif-Off en composant le 1-877-427-4088, ou en visitant le site alberta.ca/file-consumer-complaint.aspx (en anglais seulement) pour déposer une plainte en ligne.

The award of a deciduous timber allocation to Kee Tas Kee Now Sawmill Ltd. (KSL) is expected to create up to 20 permanent jobs, including professionals, heavy equipment operators, log truck drivers and labourers.
With two coniferous timber quotas already in place, KSL has proven to be a responsible timber quota holder. This will be KSL’s first deciduous timber quota, giving them the rights to deciduous timber, such as aspen and balsam poplar, within the S10 Forest Management Unit (FMU) about 330 kilometres north of Edmonton.
As part of their bid, KSL demonstrated the expected benefits to Alberta’s Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities, economic benefits for the province, and a commitment to forest management planning activities.

“The competitive timber allocation process is a great example of how we’re opening Alberta’s forest sector for business. We’re committed to providing our forest companies with long-term access to a secure and sustainable fibre supply as part of the Forest Jobs Action Plan. We’re excited to work with KSL on this opportunity.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


""On behalf of the Kee Tas Kee Now Sawmill Ltd., we would like to thank Alberta Agriculture and Forestry regarding the new S10 Deciduous Timber Allocation in S10 FMU. As KSL is owned and operated by four First Nations communities – Loon River, Whitefish Lake, Woodland Cree and Lubicon Lake – the opportunities and benefits that this will bring to the region will be significant. The ownership of this DTA will provide permanent jobs, training opportunities and economic benefits that will be felt across the region as we manage this timber resource that we all grew up in. By being involved in the forest management operations from the ground level and the development of the FMU requirements, we can balance the spiritual and cultural sensitive areas and items while blending it with sustainable forest harvesting practices and economical benefits to the region.""
Chief Albert Thunder, Whitefish Lake First Nation - #459, Chief Billy Joe Laboucan, Lubicon Lake First Nation - #453, Chief Ivan Sawan, Loon River First Nation - #476 and Chief Issac Laboucan-Avirom, Woodland Cree First Nation - #474

This timber quota is also expected to bolster new economic opportunities for the First Nations that own Kee Tas Kee Now Sawmill Ltd., potentially including a new logging and transport company in which KSL will be a key partner.
Alberta’s sustainable forest management practices provide ecological, economic, social and cultural opportunities for present and future generations.
Well-managed forests not only reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfire and the outbreak of forest pests like the mountain pine beetle, they also ensure stable economic benefit for Alberta’s rural communities.
Timber quotas are one tool the province uses to maximize the benefits of our publicly owned timber.
Quick facts

KSL has been allocated 65,000 cubic metres of deciduous timber for the first three years, followed by 100 per cent of the deciduous annual allowable cut calculated by a new Forest Management Plan for the remaining 17 years of the quota.
A timber quota lasts for 20 years and is renewable as long as the quota holder is in good standing with the Crown.
There are two types of timber quotas: Coniferous Timber Quotas (CTQ) and Deciduous Timber Allocations (DTA).
There are currently 78 CTQs and 37 DTAs in Alberta.
Alberta has three main types of forest tenure: forest management agreements, timber quotas, and timber permits.

A new fed cattle set-aside program will allow beef producers to hold on to slaughter-ready cattle on maintenance feed ration for several weeks, allowing the supply of animals to more evenly match demand and reduced processing capacity.
Cattle producers will be compensated for the extraordinary costs until the backed-up inventory is cleared. Currently, there are about 130,000 cattle backed up in feedlots as a result of reduced operating capacity at major beef processing plants in Alberta. This comes at a substantial cost to cattle producers.
The Government of Alberta will immediately increase the interim payment under AgriStability from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for the hog sector. This will put up to $25 million in the hands of pork producers immediately. Increasing the advance payment under AgriStability will result in the equivalent of $20 per head for pork producers enrolled in AgriStability.
The closure of most food service outlets across North America has cut the volume for french fries being consumed. In response, the Alberta government will also immediately increase the advance payment under AgriStability from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for the potato industry, to get cash in hands of potato producers immediately. 

“Alberta’s ranchers and producers are known for their resiliency and these programs will ensure they’re able to weather the COVID-19 pandemic and keep providing the high-quality beef, pork and potatoes we’re famous for.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Our province provides most of the country’s beef, and the current disruption is resulting in substantial costs for our ranchers. We’re doing everything we can to ensure beef, pork and potato producers are able to stay afloat until things return to normal.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


“Thank you to Minister Bibeau, Minister Dreeshen, the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta for working together to ensure beef producers across Canada and Alberta will receive the support necessary to continue providing top-quality beef to Canadians across the country. This is a first step and we look forward to continuing to work with the federal and provincial governments to ensure that all beef producers will receive the supports needed due to the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic.”
Bob Lowe, president, Canadian Cattlemen’s Association


“Alberta beef producers appreciate the commitment and leadership shown by the Government of Alberta through the contribution of matching funds to AgriRecovery for a set-aside program to immediately support our industry. Thank you, Minister Dreeshen, for recognizing the devastating impacts COVID-19 is having on Alberta’s beef industry and working together with the federal government to support the needs of producers so we can maintain our food supply chain.”
Kelly Smith-Fraser, chair, Alberta Beef Producers

AgriRecovery is a federal-provincial-territorial program intended to help agricultural producers recover from natural disasters. Alberta will work with federal and provincial governments to ensure money will get to producers as quickly as possible.
More details will be announced as they are available.
Quick facts

AgriRecovery initiatives are cost-shared 60-40 between federal and provincial governments.
On May 5, the federal government launched a national AgriRecovery initiative of up to $125 million in funding to help cattle and hog producers faced with extraordinary costs incurred by COVID-19. This includes $50 million for set-asides for cattle.
Alberta is Canada’s largest cattle-producing province, with 40.5 per cent of the national total cattle and calf inventory in 2018.
Beef is Alberta’s second-largest agri-food export, at $2 billion in 2018.
Alberta accounts for 10.4 per cent of Canada’s hog production, or about 2.8 million market hogs per year.
In April, the Potato Growers of Alberta estimated Alberta has $70 to $80 million worth of potatoes in storage, which is higher than one-quarter of the national inventory.

Construction of this major project is expected to support 750 jobs. Shortening the procurement process means workers can get shovels in the ground sooner. Vendors identified during the request for qualifications (RFQ) stage will be invited to participate in the project tendering. The invitational bid process is expected to run this month.

“Continued spending on needed infrastructure projects is critical to supporting jobs and boosting the economy as we build Alberta after the pandemic. That’s why Infrastructure is driving ahead with this new large-scale construction project that will support the development of approximately 750 direct construction jobs for Alberta workers and engineers.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure

Government is actively identifying other shovel-ready projects and working with industry partners to act quickly to keep companies across the province and their workers employed.

""Our justice system needs tools and resources to run effectively and efficiently, which is why it is great to see this progress on the Red Deer Justice Centre project. It will get Albertans back to work while it’s built, and provide Red Deer and area with the justice centre it needs when completed.""
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General

The new courthouse will be built in downtown Red Deer. The facility will include the required court technology, security provisions, space requirements and public access. There will be 16 courtrooms – 12 will be fully built-out and four will be shelled for future use.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Mountain pine beetle infestations threaten Alberta’s timber supply and healthy forest ecosystems. Millions of trees have been killed across the province since the outbreak began more than a decade ago.
Since 2018, surveys show mountain pine beetle activity has continued to grow in certain areas of the province, including the Edson Forest Area.

“Mountain pine beetles have killed millions of trees in Alberta. That is why we’ve increased funding to protect our forests for future generations. Our government is committed to working with foresters and municipalities to enable sustainable forest management practices and to reduce wildfire risks across the province.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

Department staff are working with Yellowhead County officials to identify areas where control activities will have the greatest impact on the overall provincial control effort.

“Yellowhead County appreciates the extended Mountain Pine Beetle Grant funding provided by Alberta Agriculture and Forestry. Yellowhead County residents benefit directly from this funding, with over 1,200 infected trees destroyed in our region this winter. This work, in combination with the work done directly by the province, will help our residents stay safe and allow our industry to continue to thrive.”
Jim Eglinski, mayor, Yellowhead County

The Alberta government has treated 44,214 infested trees within Yellowhead County to date. Treatment strategies include cutting down single trees to be burned or chipped, or harvesting larger areas.

“It is vital for the safety and livelihood of our communities to have the resources needed to fight the spread of the mountain pine beetle. I am pleased to see our government has allocated funds for Yellowhead County pine beetle mitigation efforts.”
Martin Long, MLA for West Yellowhead

Mountain Pine Beetle Municipal Grant Program
The municipal grant program was established in 2006 to support the costs of municipal pine beetle control operations. The program provides funding and expert advice to municipalities that support mountain pine beetle management on municipal and private lands. Funds can be awarded to municipalities with trees infested with mountain pine beetle and whose management programs align directly with Alberta's overall objectives.
Quick facts

Last winter’s extreme cold temperatures lowered mountain pine beetle activity, however mountain pine beetle infestations have still survived in Alberta’s pine forests, with the most severe concentrations being in the west-central pine-belt (Hinton, Edson, Whitecourt and Slave Lake).
Since 2018, mountain pine beetle activity has increased significantly in the Rocky Mountain House, Whitecourt and Edson Forest Areas.
Budget 2020 continues the government’s increased mountain pine beetle funding of $30 million per year through 2022-2023.
Since 2006, Alberta has spent more than $560 million controlling mountain pine beetle.

These projects are part of the $2 billion that government announced on April 9 in response to the COVID-19 recession.

“Every region of the province has felt the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the collapse of energy prices. We are doing everything we can to get Albertans back to work, and these projects will create good jobs for central Albertans while improving driving conditions and ensuring our important transportation corridors are ready to support the region’s businesses and job creators, once the economy recovers.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation

Dozens of shovel-ready projects will begin in the Central Region over the next few months, including:

Highway 855 rehabilitation south of Stettler.
Highway 9 paving west of Youngstown.
Rehabilitation of various highways in Special Areas.
LED lighting retrofit in central region.

In addition, $60 million is available provincewide to repair potholes and complete critical safety measures. 
These projects will bring hundreds of jobs to central Alberta, while improving driving conditions, safety, and extending the lifespan of existing highways and bridges.
Quick facts

Alberta has a vast provincial highway network that includes more than 31,400 kilometres of highways (equivalent to nearly 64,000 lane kilometres), of which:
	
almost 28,000 kilometres are paved roads
almost 2,500 kilometres are four- and six-lane divided highways


The provincial highway network includes almost 4,600 bridge structures, including bridges, overpasses and large-size culverts.
Alberta Transportation paves about 900 kilometres of highway every year and rehabilitates or replaces about 50 bridges.

“Today, Buddhists in Alberta join the Buddhist community around the world in celebrating Vesak, also known as Wesak or Buddha Day.
“This day commemorates the birth, enlightenment and death of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama.
“Buddhism has a long and rich history in Alberta. The first Buddhist temple in Alberta opened in 1929 and became the longest continually used Buddhist sanctuary in all of Canada.
“During World War II, because of the internment of Japanese Canadians, many Buddhists moved from British Columbia to Alberta. This resulted in Alberta becoming the North American birthplace of the academic study of Buddhism. 
“We continue this legacy by protecting the right of Albertans to practice their faith and share their traditions with all Albertans.
“Publicly recognizing and sharing important dates such as Vesak helps us understand each other better and work together to build a better province for all.”

The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.


Any individual exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. People can access testing by completing the COVID-19 self-assessment online. A separate self-assessment tool is available for health-care and shelter workers, enforcement and first responders. After completing the form, there is no need to call 811.
All Albertans need to work together to overcome COVID-19. Albertans are asked to share acts of kindness they have experienced in their community during this difficult time by using the hashtag #AlbertaCares.

Day care centres and out-of-school care centres will benefit from a phased approach for these supports.
Phase 1 - $6.7 million:

Centres will immediately receive a one-time grant to cover up to 25 per cent of overhead costs like rent and utilities. This accounts for the remaining portion of expenses not covered by funding under federal programs.

Phase 2 - $3.2 million:

Upon reopening, centres will receive a grant for cleaning and sanitation supplies to adhere to public health guidelines, as well as to assist with staff recruitment and training.

Phase 3 - $6.9 million:

After three months of being open, centres will potentially receive a third grant to offset deferred bills and to address unforeseen operational issues. This will be based on an assessment of other federal and provincial support programs.


“Access to quality child care is going to be an important part of getting Alberta’s economy back on track. We’re providing this money so child care centres will be ready to care for kids as soon as health guidelines allow.”
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services

Once child care entres reopen, they will be required to adhere to public health guidelines developed by Children’s Services and Alberta Health. These guidelines will be released as soon as possible.

“We appreciate the government’s efforts to assist operators during the first phase of the province’s relaunch strategy. This money will help operators start reopening their centres and support parents’ return to work. We look forward to working with the Government of Alberta on a more long-term and predictable funding model for the sector.”
Anita Turna, chair, Alberta Association of Child Care Operators


“It’s been very encouraging to work in collaboration with the Minister of Children’s Services to provide support to owners and operators during this trying time. We look forward to seeing our families and children.” 
Staci Wilson, chair, School Age Care Directors Association of Alberta


“Out-of-school care programs will look different now and we look forward to welcoming our kids back again. The Government of Alberta’s staged funding program will help us do that safely and to cover some of the costs we incurred while no revenue was coming in.”
Jennifer Sissons, owner and director, A Child First Out of School Care

Approved family day home agencies will also be able to access funding, up to $1 million total, to support current operations and supplies and equipment to adhere to public health guidelines.
This initiative is one element of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy that must be in place before Alberta can begin to safely remove public health restrictions. For more information, visit alberta.ca/COVID19.
Quick facts

Supports are in addition to federal support for businesses, including:
	
Increased wage support for qualifying small and medium-sized businesses to 75 per cent, for up to three months.
Canada Emergency Business Account provides interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to small businesses and not-for-profits to help cover their operating costs during a period where their revenues have been temporarily reduced.
		
$10,000 is considered a grant and does not have to be repaid.


Deferral of GST payments until June 30.
Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance relief program, to cover 75 per cent of rent payments.


Provincial support during the pandemic has been directed to ensuring child care is available for the children of essential workers.
As of May 5, child care centres have reopened in 29 towns and cities across the province to support essential workers. There are a total of 183 centres open and a total of 4,008 spaces available. All reopened centres were provided a $500 one-time grant for PPE and cleaning supplies, and receive a daily reimbursement for reopened spaces that aren’t filled.
Approved family day homes and private day homes have been permitted to remain open throughout the pandemic. In March, Children’s Services allowed approved family day homes to serve six children, in addition to their own.
About 18,000 Albertans work in the child care sector, serving more than 100,000 children.

Public health officials, Occupational Health and Safety, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and others have all worked together to protect worker safety at the plants and help limit the spread of COVID-19.
A dedicated Alberta Health Services task force is working around the clock to respond to each COVID-19 outbreak. Alberta Health Services and Occupational Health and Safety are visiting facilities regularly to ensure control measures are implemented and provide ongoing advice and support to the workers and employers.
To date, there have been 946 COVID-19 cases in workers at the Cargill facility and 798 workers (84 per cent) have recovered. At JBS, 566 workers were confirmed cases and 434 workers (76 per cent) have recovered. Harmony Beef has 38 confirmed COVID-19 cases in workers and 12 workers (32 per cent) have recovered. 
Safety measures in place
Meat processing facilities in Alberta are expected to implement safety controls that meet requirements identified by Alberta Health Services, Occupational Health and Safety legislation and chief medical officer of health orders. These controls vary among the facilities to address each situation and operation. Some controls in place may include:

staff temperature check before entering the facility
providing face masks and other personal protective equipment to employees to be worn at all times
enhanced cleaning and sanitizing practices
staggered breaks and shift flexibility
prohibiting unnecessary visitors at the facility
increasing distance between employees and installing screening between individual employee stations
vehicles entering the plant gate cannot have more than two passengers
installing numerous physical barriers throughout the facility (for example, Plexiglas partitions)
reconfiguring lunchrooms and locker rooms to comply with physical distancing requirements
installing additional sink(s) and sanitization stations
reconfiguring various entrances / egress points to control the flow of foot traffic
updating procedures, training materials

Occupational Health and Safety continues to prioritize the inspection and monitoring of food processing plants to ensure the required controls are in place to meet the Occupational Health and Safety legislation and chief medical officer of health orders.
Actions taken
The Government of Alberta, along with the chief medical officer of health and Alberta Health Services, have hosted three telephone town halls to listen to and answer questions from workers, the community and employers.
Since the outbreaks were declared, Alberta Health Services has conducted three inspections at Cargill, four at JBS, and two at Harmony Beef. AHS has also hosted virtual town halls with employees at several facilities, and has provided information to employees in English and translated into multiple languages.
Occupational Health and Safety joined Alberta Health Services on site at Cargill for the reopening on May 4. Both are on site on May 6 to further assess the operations.
COVID-19 is not a food-borne illness. That said, to support the continuous operation of Alberta’s food supply chain, Agriculture and Forestry has partnered with the CFIA to increase food inspector capacity. Provincial meat inspectors are being trained for deployment to high-priority federally licensed plants in Alberta, if needed, to maintain inspection capacity.
Agriculture and Forestry has also established an intergovernmental business resumption protocol for provincially and federally licensed food processing facilities in Alberta. This protocol was the first of its kind in the country. It formalized the cooperative approach used among the various organizations to minimize disruptions in the food supply and ensure operations can safely resume as quickly as possible when there is a closure.
All three of the agencies continue to provide support and advice to the facilities to ensure worker health and safety.
Occupational Health and Safety is now conducting an investigation into the circumstances surrounding potential exposure of workers at Cargill and JBS related to COVID-19. This will also include an investigation of any potential non-compliance that may have affected the health and safety of workers at the facility. Complex investigations such as this can take a significant amount of time to complete.
Worker information
Alberta Health Services is working with the local municipalities, Primary Care Networks and others to support any positive cases and limit the spread within each community. This includes:

Testing and providing medical supports for anyone in need.
Educating on how to use PPE.
Providing information and support for how to safely self-isolate.
Providing information on available supports.

Assessment centres have been opened in High River and Brooks for staff and community members. Testing is being offered to all workers, including those without symptoms, to limit the spread.
Translation services are being used to help explain requirements concerning self-isolation and COVID-19 testing, and to communicate the availability of other supports that may be necessary to prevent the spread of the virus.
AHS is also posting additional information on its COVID-19 website to support workers and employers in these settings.
The health and safety of all workers and Albertans is critical. Workers are encouraged to work with employers to address any concern raised related to workplace health and safety. If workers feel the issue is not addressed, they can contact the Occupational Health and Safety contact centre at 1-866-415-8690.
As more businesses continue to reopen, it is crucial that Albertans, including workers, continue to maintain physical distancing, practise good hand hygiene and sanitizing measures.
Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.
Quick facts

COVID-19 is not a food borne illness.
There are almost 200 meat slaughter facilities in Alberta.
Confirmed and recovered cases:
	
Cargill: 946 cases in workers; 798 recovered (84%)
JBS Foods: 566 cases in workers; 434 recovered (76%)
Harmony: 38 cases in workers; 12 recovered (32%)

If passed, the Utility Payment Deferral Program Act will allow electricity and natural gas providers to apply for loans either from the Balancing Pool or from the Government of Alberta, ensuring they have the cash flow to support Albertans through the Utility Payment Deferral Program.
The program – one of the first of several supports announced by government to protect Albertans and small businesses from the economic impacts of the pandemic – allows those experiencing financial hardship as a direct result of COVID-19 to defer their utility payments until June 18. Eligible residential, farm, and small commercial customers can do so by contacting their utility provider.

“Our government appreciates the cooperation and flexibility shown by utility providers to help their fellow Albertans through these challenging times. We recognize industry has also been greatly impacted by COVID-19. Safe and reliable electricity is critical to Alberta’s pandemic response, and the Utility Payment Deferral Program Act will provide temporary financial support necessary to implement the program.”
Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity


“At times like this, more than anything else, it’s important that we work collectively and make the right decisions for those who count on us. Bill 14 ensures that Albertans will have the assistance they need with their utility bills, so they can focus their minds on taking care of their health and the health of their families.”
Stuart Lee, president and CEO, EPCOR

Bill 14 also lays out repayment criteria for individuals who defer payments through the program. Repayment can occur through equal, monthly instalments – starting when the program ends on June 18 – or through a repayment plan agreed to by the retailer and customer. All deferred payments must be paid back by June 18, 2021.
The bill will also provide the Alberta Utilities Commission with the authority to oversee the deferral program and the associated loans.
This program is one element of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy that must be in place before Alberta can begin to safely remove public health restrictions. For more information, visit alberta.ca/covid-19.
Quick facts

Bill 14 contains provisions that explicitly prohibit electricity and gas service providers from disconnecting customers during the time covered by the deferral program.
In total, deferred payments are anticipated to reach about $337 million. To cover this amount, up to $119 million has been approved for loans through the Balancing Pool and a further $104 million has been provided by government. It is estimated that utilities, including the Alberta Electric System Operator, will defer about $114 million.
Loans to retailers will be recovered over a 12-month period after the program concludes, as customers pay down their deferred balances.

Planning and design work is underway to replace cladding, windows and insulation on the provincial building in Lac La Biche. This project will provide about 14 construction-related jobs for Albertans, as well as support indirect economic spinoff throughout the community.

“This is a critical time in the province when we need to be sure we are taking quick action to help Albertans recover from economic hardships. Shovel-ready projects, like this one in Lac La Biche, help us inject much-needed dollars directly into communities where it is needed most.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure

With in-person classes cancelled, teachers continue to work from the at-home learning guidelines established on March 20, with subject matter and workload varying by grade level.

“I want to thank our teachers, school support staff, administrators, education partners and parents for quickly adapting to our current reality and helping ensure that their children continue to learn as best as possible under the circumstances. I know everyone is making the effort to connect students. I look forward to school returning when the time is right and health restrictions allow for it.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

Schools are using multiple approaches to deliver content to students. More than 90 per cent of school authorities are offering online learning, while about half are also emailing, telephoning and sending paper-based work to students.
School authorities and the government have provided about 60,000 devices, including laptops, Chromebooks, tablets and iPads, to students as they learn from home. School authorities have prioritized providing devices to students based on need, focusing on students who do not have access to devices, have complex needs, or are high school students. Additionally, the Métis Nation of Alberta, in partnership with Rupertsland Institute, has purchased more than 2,200 devices for self-identified Métis students across Alberta.

“We are proud to provide our Métis students with devices so they can continue to engage and succeed with online learning and the digital classroom in the months ahead. We believe that working in partnership with the College of Alberta School Superintendents and school authorities reflects a best practice where no child gets left behind in these unprecedented times.”
Lorne Gladu, CEO, Rupertsland Institute – Métis Centre of Excellence

Supports for families and parents
Recognizing that many families have questions about at-home learning, a provincial education helpline is now available to parents through which Alberta Education staff will address their questions and direct them to their school authorities, where applicable. The intent is to provide advice to families, particularly to parents of children with disabilities, who have questions about their child’s program now that the traditional delivery process has changed. Parents can reach the helpline by calling 780-422-6548 (toll-free by dialing 310-0000, followed by the 10-digit phone number) or by emailing studentsupport@gov.ab.ca.
Additionally, more than 4,000 curriculum resources to support parents and students are available on the LearnAlberta.ca website. School authorities have also made various resources available on their own websites.

“The Alberta School Councils’ Association believes that parents and guardians should have access to an independent, formal source of support and guidance when barriers prevent optimum learner success, especially for children with disabilities. The parent helpline will offer relief for families struggling to navigate a new learning environment. We appreciate working with Alberta Education and partners on re-entry planning, given the complexity of a return-to-school plan that must consider the wide impact of COVID-19.”
Brandi Rai, president, Alberta School Councils’ Association

Re-entry plan engagement
No decisions have been made on school operations for the 2020-21 school year starting in September. The province is working with school authorities and education system partners on developing a comprehensive re-entry plan that considers three scenarios, which could exist by September. They are:

Normal school operations are able to resume.
Schools are partially re-opened, with some level of restrictions.
Teacher-directed at-home learning continues.

The re-entry plan will prioritize the safety and well-being of our teachers, staff and students. In addition to the feedback gathered from the education system, the plan will honour collective bargaining agreements, and will be informed by Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy and advice provided by Alberta’s chief medical officer of health.

“The challenge of reopening schools is very complex. We appreciate the efforts of the minister and department officials to meaningfully engage us on these important issues. The health and safety of students, teachers, staff, families and the broader community are paramount in these discussions. We are using input from provincial ATA teacher representatives and a recent COVID-19 related survey of over 2,000 teachers to share the views of the profession.”
Jason Schilling, president, Alberta Teachers’ Association


“We appreciate government’s efforts to engage the Alberta School Boards Association and Alberta’s 61 locally elected school boards on the re-entry plan. As these are early days in the planning process, school boards will continue to work with government and provide input on a safe and appropriate re-entry plan and timeline. School boards are eager to welcome staff and students back into schools as soon as it is safe to do so.”

“The College of Alberta School Superintendents is pleased to be working with Alberta Education as together we develop a re-entry plan for the 2020-21 school year. We understand that students, teachers and staff are anxiously awaiting to return to class; however, any return to in-person schooling must prioritize a successful transition for our students while ensuring the health and wellness of everyone attending our schools.”
Bevan Daverne, president, College of Alberta School Superintendents

This initiative is one element of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy that must be in place before Alberta can begin to safely remove public health restrictions. For more information, visit alberta.ca/covid-19.

These projects are part of the $2 billion that government announced on April 9 to get Alberta back to work.

“The Peace Region is an increasingly important economic driver for our province, and these projects will help ensure necessary transportation corridors are ready to support the region’s businesses and job creators once the economy recovers, while creating badly needed jobs in the short term.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation

Some of the shovel-ready road and bridge repair projects that will begin in the Peace Region in the next few months include:

Beginning preparation for grade widening on Highway 697 near La Crete.
Repaving 19 kilometres of Highway 35 south of the Town of High Level.
Repaving 32 kilometres of Highway 684 from Highway 2 to the Town of Peace River.
Repaving 42 kilometres of Highway 43 between Fox Creek and Valleyview.
Grading 19 kilometres of Highway 679 from Highway 49 to Highway 2.
Repaving 13 kilometres of Highway 670 east of Highway 43.
Slide repair on Highway 40 near the Kakwa River.
Repaving 12 kilometres of Highway 2 from west of Kinuso to east of Highway 33.
Various slide repairs throughout the Peace Region.

In addition, $60 million will be spent provincewide on pothole repairs and other critical safety measures. 
These projects will bring hundreds of badly needed jobs to the Peace region and pave the way for future economic growth, while improving driving conditions, safety, and getting the best value for taxpayers out of existing highways and bridges.
Quick facts

Alberta has a vast provincial highway network that includes more than 31,400 kilometres of highways (equivalent to nearly 64,000 lane kilometres), of which:
	
almost 28,000 kilometres are paved roads
almost 2,500 kilometres are four- and six-lane divided highways



The provincial highway network includes almost 4,600 bridge structures, including bridges, overpasses and large-size culverts.
Alberta Transportation paves about 900 kilometres of highway every year and rehabilitates or replaces about 50 bridges.

Chiropractors, paramedics, respiratory therapists, physiotherapists, psychiatric nurses, LPNs, pharmacists and dental hygienists will now be allowed to perform contact tracing duties after completing training.



Albertans downloading tracer app

The ABTraceTogether app will enhance current manual contact tracing and capacity, and facilitate early detection to help reduce the spread of the virus and better protect Albertans. It means Albertans will be contacted more quickly if they are at risk.
Use of the app is voluntary; users must opt in.
The app does not track the user’s physical location and does not use GPS. Protecting privacy is paramount; all contact data is only on the user’s phone and is deleted after 21 days.  
Secure contact tracing is a cornerstone of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy. More information on the app, including links to download it, can be found online.
Since its launch, the app has attracted more than 124,050 registered users.

Quick facts

The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.


Any individual exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. People can access testing by completing the COVID-19 self-assessment online. A separate self-assessment tool is available for health-care and shelter workers, enforcement and first responders. After completing the form, there is no need to call 811.
All Albertans need to work together to overcome COVID-19. Albertans are asked to share acts of kindness they have experienced in their community during this difficult time by using the hashtag #AlbertaCares.

APL is also expanding testing capacity by securing additional supplies including swabs and reagents, and taking steps toward achieving 24-7 testing.

 “As the charity partner for Calgary’s major hospitals and care centres, we are committed to making significant investments in areas that will have substantial impact on COVID-19 efforts. We’re working alongside Alberta Health Services daily to understand how the community can best support the pandemic response during these unprecedented times. We also know how important it is for our donors to show support for the hard-working health-care professionals who are our first line of defence against the virus.”
Mike Meldrum, president and CEO, Calgary Health Trust

Albertans are also encouraged to download the ABTraceTogether app to help prevent community spread. The app is available to download free from the App Store and Google Play.
Quick facts

As of May 1, Alberta Precision Laboratories has completed more than 150,000 tests, making Alberta a national and international leader in per capita COVID-19 testing.
Alberta is currently averaging about 5,000 tests per day.
New equipment will be used in the future for other forms of virus testing, including for seasonable influenza.
The new equipment will be located at sites around the province where they are most needed to support enhanced public surveillance and testing activities.
APL is a subsidiary of Alberta Health Services, delivering high-quality diagnostic lab services to Albertans across our health-care system.
Calgary Health Trust’s $1.7-million contribution is part of its Clean Hands, Giving Hearts COVID-19 Response Fund.

Government has allocated $2 million to match donations to COVID-19 response efforts by designated Alberta-based charities. So far, individual Albertans and Alberta-based corporations have donated generously to the eight designated charitable organizations. The province’s contribution will boost these donations.

“Today is #GivingTuesdayNow, a new global day of giving in response to COVID-19. Thank you to Albertans for their generosity and for thinking of others as we all work together to get through this tough time. The participating charities are doing fantastic work to get dollars quickly to local charities delivering services to Albertans in need. Every donation will help in some way, and I am inviting all Albertans to embrace the power of kindness and give what they can to meet the needs of vulnerable communities during the pandemic.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women

Several organizations have established COVID-19 fundraising campaigns to distribute money quickly to those who need it most. The province will match donations made by Albertans to these designated organizations between April 15 and May 31. Organizations include:

United Way of the Capital Region – Local Love in a Global Crisis Campaign
United Way Calgary and Area – COVID-19 Community Response Fund
United Way of Central Alberta – COVID-19 Community Response Fund
Calgary Foundation – COVID-19 Pandemic Recovery Program
Edmonton Community Foundation – COVID Rapid Response Fund
Community Foundation of Southeastern Alberta – COVID Response for Southeast Alberta
Community Foundation of Lethbridge and Southwestern Alberta – COVID Response and Recovery Grants Program
Community Foundation of Northwestern Alberta – Better Together COVID-19 Response Fund/Community Kitchen and Food Bank Fund

COVID-19 pandemic response programs play a supporting role to flow donations through to local community-based non-profits and charitable organizations that deliver services to vulnerable Albertans. Donations will help feed the hungry, care for seniors, support at-risk children, and keep Albertans employed.
Encouraging volunteerism during COVID-19
The province recently launched the new Alberta Cares Connector to help Albertans find or post volunteer opportunities. The response to this new tool has been strong so far, with Albertans performing more than 276,000 searches, submitting about 11,000 volunteer applications and creating 3,300 profiles on the Alberta Cares Connector.
Albertans have also submitted more than 460 nominations to the new Alberta Northern Lights Volunteer Recognition Program, which honours everyday heroes and encourages the spirit of volunteerism.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Bill 14, the Utility Payment Deferral Program Act, will be introduced on May 6, when the legislature reconvenes.  
Government announced supportive measures to provide immediate financial relief for Albertans on March 18. Utility bill payment deferral was among the items. Residential, farm, and small commercial customers can defer bill payments for electricity and natural gas until June 18.

“Albertans are currently facing an economic one-two punch. The province’s residents and businesses are contending with the COVID-19 pandemic as well as plunging oil prices resulting from the recent OPEC price war. There’s no sugar-coating it – these are dire times for the province. Government is offering help in the form of allowing individuals and small businesses to defer some utility payments. Albertans are resilient, but we need to support those who need help most during this challenging time.”
Jason Nixon, Government House Leader


“Bill 14, the Utility Payment Deferral Program Act, is critical legislation. This bill will allow utilities to offer electricity customers across the province much-needed financial relief, while ensuring they can continue to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electricity during these unprecedented times.""
Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Electricity and Natural Gas

Legislation already on the order paper will also be debated when the legislature reconvenes.
Quick facts

These projects are part of the $2 billion that government announced on April 9 to get Alberta back to work.

“Southern Alberta faces the same serious economic challenges as communities across our province. These road and bridge projects will provide hundreds of jobs for southern Albertans while maintaining the critical infrastructure that helps get groceries, food and fuel where it needs to be and connects us with our largest trading partner. We are taking action across our province to get Albertans back to work and our economy back on track.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation

The projects that are part of this investment are shovel-ready, so Albertans can get to work as quickly as possible. Further projects will be identified over the next few months.
Some of the road and bridge repair projects in southern Alberta include:

Intersection improvements at Highways 1 and 3.
Bridge replacement on Highway 560 near Langdon.
LED lighting retrofit in Medicine Hat.
19 kilometres of repaving on Highway 1, between Highways 36 and 875.
22 kilometres of repaving on Highway 1, between Highway 561 and Highway 901.
30 kilometres of repaving on Highway 21, between Highway 1 and Rockyford.
17 kilometres of repaving on Highway 22, between Highway 541 and the Town of Black Diamond.
12 kilometres of repaving on Highway 550, between Rosemary and Highway 36.
Roundabout at Highway 566 and Range Road 11.
Seven kilometres of grade widening on Highway 817 between Highways 24 and 901.
Bridge deck rehabilitation on the South Saskatchewan River bridge on eastbound Highway 1.

In addition, $60 million is available provincewide to repair potholes and complete critical safety measures. 
By investing in the critical infrastructure that keeps our supply lines strong, southern Alberta will see jobs created when they are desperately needed, while ensuring access to our trading partners and future economic opportunities.

Construction is about halfway complete on the $1.2 million infrastructure maintenance project to replace the chiller and air handling unit in the Red Deer Provincial Building. This work is part of an almost $2.5 million investment the Alberta government is injecting into Red Deer for infrastructure maintenance projects to help keep Albertans working.

“Faced with the economic realities brought on by COVID-19, it’s critical we find ways to help Alberta recover. Investments in capital maintenance and renewal projects ensure wise use of taxpayer dollars by taking care of our provincial assets while providing quick action, shovel-ready solutions that help keep businesses operating and Albertans working.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure


“The infrastructure maintenance projects underway in our city are great news for us all. Any time we invest dollars right here in Red Deer, local companies and local workers benefit. This, in turn, ensures a much-needed boost to our local economy during these difficult times.”
Adriana LaGrange, MLA for Red Deer-North


“In these challenging times, our government is making strategic investments to maintain and renew the province’s public infrastructure. In Red Deer, infrastructure maintenance projects valued at about $2.5 million will keep Red Deer working, benefiting local businesses, individuals and families.”
Jason Stephan, MLA for Red Deer-South

Quick facts

In response to the COVID-19 recession, the Alberta government is doubling its capital maintenance and renewal (CMR) funding in 2020-21 from $937 million to $1.9 billion by accelerating the Capital Plan.
Alberta Infrastructure is delivering CMR projects valued at about $180.5 million in communities throughout the province. This funding will help keep about 1,014 Albertans working.

“This week, we join communities across the country to promote healthy attitudes and actions that foster well-being in recognition of Mental Health Week.
“When it comes to mental health and resilience, the importance of social connection cannot be overstated. The past few months have been difficult for Albertans – between the COVID-19 pandemic, economic uncertainty and floods in northern Alberta. For those suffering from addiction or mental health issues, the impact may be more significant with increased levels of anxiety, fear or depression.
“Social connection can help us weather the storm. I encourage you all to reach out to your friends and family. If you know someone who suffers from mental illness, take it a step further and reach in: ask them how they are doing. Let them know you care about them.
“In line with this year’s theme for Mental Health Week of ‘getting real about how you feel,’ be honest about how you’re feeling with people you trust. It may be uncomfortable at first, but research indicates that showing vulnerability increases a sense of closeness and belonging. It might also create a space where others will feel comfortable sharing how they feel with you.
“Together we can do what we cannot do alone.
“We are committed to protecting your mental health and providing the counselling supports you need, in person or virtually, to get you on the road back to health and recovery. Together, let’s build a healthier, stronger Alberta.”
If you are struggling with mental illness or addiction, supports are available at no charge, 24-7.

Read the news release.
Resuming non-urgent surgeries and allied health services

The province is ready to lift some restrictions on non-urgent scheduled day surgeries in regions where hospital and clinic capacity and the rate of new COVID-19 infections does not present a significant risk.
The most urgent patients and those waiting the longest will receive care first. Alberta Health Services will contact patients on wait-lists to reschedule procedures.
Independent regulated health professionals, such as chiropractors, physiotherapists, psychologists and other community providers (including optometrists, audiologists and dieticians), are also permitted to resume operations as long as they are able to follow Alberta Health guidance to limit transmission in these settings. Read the news release.

Albertans downloading tracer app

The ABTraceTogether app will enhance current manual contact tracing and capacity, and facilitate early detection to help reduce the spread of the virus and better protect Albertans. It means Albertans will be contacted more quickly if they are at risk.
Use of the app is voluntary; users must opt in.
The app does not track the user’s physical location and does not use GPS. Protecting privacy is paramount; all contact data is only on the user’s phone and is deleted after 21 days.  
Secure contact tracing is a cornerstone of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy. More information on the app, including links to download it, can be found online.
Since its launch, the app has attracted more than 103,660 registered users.
Technical issues with the registration code, experienced by some users, have been resolved.

Information sheets and other resources on family violence prevention are available at alberta.ca/COVID19.

Quick facts

The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.


Any individual exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. People can access testing by completing the COVID-19 self-assessment online. A separate self-assessment tool is available for health-care and shelter workers, enforcement and first responders. After completing the form, there is no need to call 811.


All Albertans need to work together to overcome COVID-19. Albertans are asked to share acts of kindness they have experienced in their community during this difficult time by using the hashtag #AlbertaCares.

As Alberta continues to flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections, the province is ready to lift some of the restrictions on non-urgent scheduled day surgeries in regions where hospital and clinic capacity and the rate of new COVID-19 infections does not present a significant risk. A carefully controlled and phased approach will be used, with the most urgent patients and those waiting the longest receiving care first.

“Many Albertans have had to delay important non-urgent scheduled procedures in order for us to ensure our health-care system was prepared for an influx of patients with COVID-19. Thanks to the measures our government and AHS have taken, and the hard work and dedication of front-line health-care workers, our health-care system now has the capacity to begin resuming some of these procedures. Together, we will move forward, get patients the care they need, surround vulnerable Albertans with a ring of defence and build back our province one step at a time.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The first priority will be to treat patients who would be at the highest risk if their surgery was further delayed and those who have been waiting longest. AHS has created a centralized booking system, and will contact patients on wait-lists to reschedule procedures. As procedures ramp up, the province will continue to evaluate and determine additional procedures that can resume, such as short-term overnight stays.

“The safety of our patients, staff and physicians will always be our priority. We will relaunch day surgeries in a strategic and thoughtful way and gradually add additional procedures and volumes. We will balance this relaunch with the ongoing response to COVID-19, and continually evaluate as we move forward.”
Dr. Verna Yiu, president and chief executive officer, Alberta Health Services

In addition to resuming some non-urgent surgeries, independent regulated health professionals, such as chiropractors, physiotherapists, psychologists and other community providers, including optometrists, audiologists and dieticians, are also permitted to resume operations as long as they are able to follow Alberta Health guidance to limit transmission in these settings.
The Government of Alberta is working closely with the professional colleges that govern allied health professionals in Alberta to develop guidelines for their members who choose to resume operations. This includes guidelines related to physical distancing, patient screening, care of patients with COVID-19, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and cleaning procedures. In the meantime, as these guidelines are being developed, health professionals should follow Alberta Health guidelines on safe practices. Each clinic or practitioner will be responsible for determining their ability to keep themselves, their patients and staff safe.
All other existing public health measures remain in place to stop the spread of COVID-19. Albertans must face relaunch and recovery with the same focus, discipline and resilience they have shown throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Any individual exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 should take the AHS self-assessment and get tested if instructed to do so. Symptoms include:
	
Fever
Chills
A new cough or worsening of a chronic cough
New or worsening shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Sore throat or painful swallowing
Stuffy or runny nose
Headache

This funding is part of the accelerated capital maintenance and renewal totalling $2 billion that government announced on April 9 to get Alberta back to work.

“Fort McMurray and north central Alberta have been hard hit in recent years with natural disasters and the oil price collapse. These road and bridge projects will provide hundreds of jobs for Albertans, keep companies moving, and provide more value for taxpayers. We are taking action to fix our infrastructure now to get Albertans back to work.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation

Dozens of road and bridge repair projects that will create jobs quickly will be underway in the next few months in the Fort McMurray and north central region, some of which include:

Repaving 35 kilometres of Highway 2, between Highways 13 and 39.
Repaving 17 kilometres of Highway 63, between north of Mariana Lake to south of Sand Tiger Lodge.
Hangingstone Bridge Replacement on Highway 63.
Repaving eight kilometres of Highway 2, on either side of Highway 616.
Repaving 18 kilometres of Highway 16, on either side of Highway 947.
Repaving 13 kilometres of Highway 16, between Highways 32 and 751.
Culvert replacement on Highway 16 near Wildwood.
Preventative maintenance work to extend the lifespan of Highway 19.
Culvert replacement on Highway 39 near Warburg.
Preventive maintenance work to extend the lifespan along Highway 40.
Culvert replacement on Highway 647.

In addition, $60 million is available provincewide to repair potholes and complete critical safety measures. 
These projects will bring jobs to the Fort McMurray and north central region where they are needed most, while improving driving conditions, safety, and extending the lifespan of highways and bridges.
Quick facts

Alberta has a vast provincial highway network that includes more than 31,400 kilometres of highways (equivalent to nearly 64,000 lane kilometres), of which:
	
almost 28,000 kilometres are paved roads

With the province’s fibre supply facing significant pressures, including mountain pine beetle and wildfire, the government is taking steps to ensure access to fibre to support a strong and competitive forest industry that attracts investment and provides stable, good-paying jobs for hard-working Albertans.
The Forest Jobs Action Plan supports forest businesses by increasing the AAC by up to 13 per cent, while ensuring continued sustainable forest management principles. These actions include:

Ensuring a more expedient return of wildfire burned areas to productive forests.
Increasing the AAC by harvesting unallocated portions of already approved areas.
Utilizing residual fibre and lumber waste for value-added opportunities.
Using superior naturally occurring seedlings that are better for the long-term health and resilience of our forests.
Restructuring forest management plans with foresters to better allocate timber.


“The Forest Jobs Action Plan shows that we are committed to sustainable, long-term fibre access for foresters while ensuring our forests continue to be sustainable and can be enjoyed by future generations of Albertans. We’re giving forest companies the certainty they need by increasing the AAC by up to 13 per cent and exploring additional economic opportunities.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


“We commend Premier Kenney and Minister Dreeshen for taking this important step to secure forest sector jobs in Alberta. As an industry, we take great pride in how we manage Alberta’s forests. We plant more than two trees for every tree we harvest, make detailed plans for wildlife, ensure protection of streams, and grow forests for future generations of Albertans to enjoy. This decision will help ensure a competitive future for our industry and the more than 40,000 Albertans whose jobs are supported by forestry.”
Fred Dzida, chair, Alberta Forest Products Association Board of Directors

The plan will also involve future stakeholder engagement to drive innovation and develop policy options that use forest management as a risk mitigation tool to benefit all forested lands, in coordination with the Ministry of Environment and Parks, slated to begin in 2021.
Alberta’s forest management plans are designed to align with the work being done by the caribou sub-regional taskforce planning.
When done sustainably, forest management can be used to help restore critical wildlife habitat over the long term.
Quick facts

About 60 per cent, or 38 million hectares, of Alberta is forested, meaning our province’s forested area is larger than the entire country of Japan.
In 2018, the forest sector directly supported 946 small businesses and 58 medium and large-sized businesses, which employed 40,000 Albertans.

“May 3-9 marks North American Occupational Safety and Health Week.
“I encourage Albertans to focus on ways to prevent injury and illness in the workplace, at home and in the community.
“This year, we need to take preventative measures in our workplaces and communities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to thank and honour all workers who are helping provide services to Albertans during this challenging time. Our government appreciates the dedication of these workers and we are grateful for all their hard work during these unprecedented times.
“In 2019, 165 Albertans either didn’t make it home from work or succumbed to workplace illnesses or injuries. Another 50,000 Albertans were injured on the job. My thoughts are with all Albertans and their families whose lives have been altered by a workplace injury, illness or death.
“This week reminds us that employers, workers and government all have responsibilities to create healthy and safe workplaces and communities. We are committed to protecting workers and preventing further workplace tragedies.
“Let’s work together to make sure Albertans can come home healthy and safe from their jobs each day.”

Changes to the nursing home regulations will allow nurse practitioners to act as primary care providers in nursing homes, admitting and assessing residents, as well as offering follow-up care. Changes will also enable nurse practitioners and other qualified health professionals to prescribe medication and order treatments in nursing homes, according to their scopes of practice.

“Nurse practitioners’ advanced skills and knowledge are needed now more than ever. Removing barriers so they can fulfil their role as independent primary care providers in nursing homes is part of our commitment to do everything we can to protect Alberta’s most vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Alberta nurse practitioners have the broadest and most independent scope of practice in Canada. Current nursing home regulations do not allow nurse practitioners and other health professionals to work to their full scopes in nursing homes. Changes to the regulations will increase access to quality care for nursing home residents while reducing red tape and duplication for health professionals, service providers and operators.

“Nurse practitioners are important members of the AHS team. These changes support our ongoing commitment to nurse practitioners, enabling them to work to full scope of advanced practice. Maximizing the roles our clinicians play in our response to COVID-19 will be critical to providing comprehensive and quality care to continuing care residents.”
Dr. Verna Yiu, president and chief executive officer, Alberta Health Services


“Nurse practitioners are in a unique position to provide a broad scope of services in Alberta nursing homes. We look forward to working with government and AHS to reduce regulatory red tape and identify more ways nurse practitioners can help meet the province’s health-care needs.”
Mary-Elizabeth Cooper, president, Nurse Practitioner Association of Alberta

Quick facts

Changes will remain in effect until Aug. 14, unless the ministerial order is terminated earlier or the public health emergency is reduced or extended.

Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance physical distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

“Polish history is the story of a nation fighting to be free, and an indomitable people refusing to give up on their dream of an independent homeland, no matter the odds. Despite suffering repeated conquests and partitions at the hands of powerful enemies, Poland’s dream would never die.
 
“On May 3, 1791, the Polish people proclaimed that truth to the world once more. The Great Sejm adopted a new constitution, a milestone in the development of human rights. It extended tolerance and freedom to all religions, gave more power to civil society, and protected rural dwellers from the worst abuses of serfdom. 
 
“This achievement was not destined to last. The young Polish nation had too many enemies with opposing interests, and the struggle ended in defeat and, again, partition.
 
“However, today Polish people can look back with well-deserved pride at the Constitution of 1791. They led the fight for justice and equality and they defended that vision through oppression, war and Communist misrule. I wish everyone a safe and happy day of celebration.”

About 60 per cent of Alberta – approximately 87 million acres – is forested. That means our province’s forested area is larger than the entire country of Japan or Germany.
Whether we live near our forests, work in them, camp in them or photograph them, they are on Crown land – which means they belong to Albertans.
Alberta Forest Week provides a great chance to celebrate our clean, healthy forests, educate people on how we properly manage invasive pests that attack them, and highlight actions that prevent and mitigate wildfires. 

“A working forest is a healthy forest. Alberta has world-class sustainable forest management practices that regenerate forests, defend against the mountain pine beetle, provide jobs and economic opportunities, and protect communities within our forests. Foresters replant millions of trees every year and intelligently reduce wildfire risk with sustainable harvesting. These measures ensure our forests will be healthy and safe for generations to come.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

Forest management plans (FMP) are one tool the province uses to manage this important public resource. When a FMP is created, companies are planning 200 years into the future. These plans must consider critical habitat, watershed health and function, recreational opportunities, traditional use, and more.
Forestry businesses also create important, good-paying jobs in our rural communities. As the province’s third-largest resource sector in 2018, the forest sector directly supported 946 small businesses and 58 mid-sized and large businesses and provided direct jobs for almost 19,000 Albertans in communities across the province.
Get out and enjoy Alberta Forest Week
Take a moment this week to celebrate Alberta’s amazing forests while respecting the guidance on outdoor activities outlined by Alberta’s chief medical officer of health:

Go for a walk in Alberta’s Forest Protection Area or another forested area.
Download the Bertie Beaver and EnviroKids activity books for free.
Do some research to learn more about Alberta’s sustainable forest management practices.

“Emergencies take many forms. Albertans know first-hand that a wildfire, flood, tornado or pandemic can significantly impact our day-to-day lives. That’s why planning ahead and being prepared is critically important.
“Emergency Preparedness Week runs May 3 to 9 this year. It is an annual hands-on learning opportunity for community leaders, first responders, all levels of government and non-government organizations. We respond together to mock emergencies and disasters to refine and improve our responses for when real emergencies occur.
“Thanks to emergency preparedness exercises and pandemic planning in years past, our province was ready to address the COVID-19 outbreak when it first arrived in our province. And the historic flooding that we have seen in northern Alberta is an important reminder that we must be prepared for the worst. We will continue to work with all of our partners to ensure the safety of Albertans.
“Emergency preparedness is as important for families and individuals as it is for the province as a whole. This week is a perfect opportunity for Albertans to take concrete actions to be better prepared to protect themselves and their families during emergencies.
“Being prepared does more than help reduce fear and loss. It also increases peace of mind for you and your family, which is critically important to us all.”

Quick tracing and containment of outbreaks is critical as the province works to gradually relaunch the economy. The ABTraceTogether app will enhance the current manual tracing process and help Albertans protect themselves and their loved ones. 

“Our efforts to flatten the curve are proving to be effective, but we must continue to remain vigilant. Each one of us has a responsibility to do our part in the fight against COVID-19. ABTraceTogether was designed to help protect Albertans and prevent community spread by quickly alerting people who may be at risk. The more Albertans who use it, the better we will be able to protect individuals from being unknowingly exposed and possibly spreading the disease. Give it a try, and encourage your family and friends to do the same. By working together, we can tackle this pandemic.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

Contact tracing is currently performed by interviewing patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, which is resource intensive and has limitations on its effectiveness as it relies on the patient’s memory. Through wireless Bluetooth technology, mobile contact tracing will complement the work of health-care workers and drastically speed up the current manual tracing process. This means Albertans will be contacted more quickly if they are at risk.
Protecting Albertans’ privacy is paramount. Use of the app is voluntary, and users must opt-in. Only your phone number is collected at the time of registering the app. The application does not track the user’s location and does not use your GPS. Data is only stored on the user’s phone in an encrypted format for 21 days only. Users must consent to sharing their data if they have tested positive for COVID-19. The only information shared with contact tracers is a random ID of those identified as close contacts after a user is diagnosed with COVID-19 – nothing identifiable is exchanged between phones. Users must be within two metres from each other for a total duration of 15 minutes in a 24-hour period in order to be notified as a close contact.
The app is now available to download for free from the App Store and Google Play.

The application is part of the Government of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely begin to remove public health restrictions and reopen our economy. Existing public health measures remain in place to stop the spread of COVID-19. For more information, visit alberta.ca/covid-19.
Quick facts

Alberta Health submitted a privacy impact assessment to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta (OIPC), which is currently being reviewed. Upon OIPC acceptance, Alberta Health will make a summary of the privacy impact assessment publicly available.
The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.


Any individual exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. People can access testing by completing the COVID-19 self-assessment online. A separate self-assessment tool is available for health-care and shelter workers, enforcement and first responders. After completing the form, there is no need to call 811.

“Conversations around the facts about sexual violence are imperative to supporting survivors, educating our youth, and working towards the safety and well-being of our society. Sexual violence is about control and any type of sexual activity without consent is sexual assault. Perpetrators abuse their authority and use trust, coercion and threats, drugs and alcohol to justify this human violation. Please learn about how you can intervene, how to support and how to identify signs of abuse in your life or your organizations. 
It is our collective responsibility to end sexual assault, and it is time to shine big, bright lights into the dark corners where this abuse occurs.  
“The Association of Alberta Sexual Assault Services found in its recent study that 45 per cent of Albertans have experienced sexual violence in their lifetime.
“As we continue to navigate a new normal during the COVID-19 pandemic, we must be aware that sexual violence can increase during times of crisis. Sexual Violence Awareness Month will focus on the actions being taken to prevent this violence, the resources and supports available to support survivors, and shine a light on the amazing organizations and staff across the province that continue to provide services to bring support and healing to those impacted by sexual violence.  
“Please know that help and support is available. I encourage anyone who needs support to reach out to the Alberta One Line for Sexual violence, the Association of Alberta Sexual Assault Services or local sexual assault centres across the province. Information about other resources available can be found on alberta.ca.
“I want to express my deepest gratitude for all the front-line workers at sexual assault centres, crisis centres and support phone lines across the province, especially during these difficult times. Thank you for being a beacon of hope to those in need, and helping to empower survivors to share their stories and access supports.
“Learn the facts about consent and how to be an ally. Knowing the facts about sexual assault is the only way to stop sexual violence.""

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




“The Government of Alberta is concerned about all crime, including the illegal use of firearms. Today’s order by Ottawa does little to target criminals. Instead, Ottawa is singling out law-abiding Canadians who purchased their property legally, have owned these items safely for years, and who have committed no crimes,” stated Alberta Premier Jason Kenney.
“We know that the overwhelming majority of firearms used criminally in Canada are smuggled in illegally from the United States. Instead of addressing this, Ottawa will instead spend vast sums of money to criminalize law-abiding Canadians. That money would be far better used to pursue the smugglers and drug gangs that plague our society,” added Kenney.
“We also know that violent criminals who use guns are often released with surprisingly soft sentences. Rather than focus on law-abiding Canadians, we’d call on Parliament to bring back tough, mandatory sentences for the criminals who flagrantly endanger Canadians with their use of illegal guns,” implored Alberta Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer.
In November 2019, the Alberta legislature unanimously passed Government Motion 41, which stated:
“Be it resolved that the Legislative Assembly recognize and support the ability of Albertans to lawfully and in a responsible manner own and possess firearms and to engage in permitted activities involving the use of firearms, including but not limited to hunting and sport shooting.”
“The Government of Alberta will scrutinize today’s move by Ottawa and explore potential responses through this lens,” said Schweitzer.
“In response to today’s announcement from Ottawa, our government is actively considering appointing Alberta’s own chief firearms officer (CFO) to replace the CFO appointed by Ottawa,” concluded Kenney.

“Now that the weather has warmed up and the snow has finally melted, it’s time for Albertans to think about motorcycle safety.
“I love riding, and look forward to the beginning of each motorcycle season – especially this year after being stuck inside for so long. But while we crave the freedom of the open highway, it’s important to remember that everyone needs to do their part to keep motorcyclists safe on the road.
“May is Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month and I would like to remind all motorists of the role they play in keeping motorcyclists safe. Due to their smaller size, motorcycles are often hard to see and require extra room to prevent serious accidents. When motorcycles crash, their riders lack the protection of an enclosed vehicle and are more likely to be injured or killed. In a typical year, about 30 motorcyclists die and more than 600 are injured on Alberta roads.
“Drivers should keep motorcyclists in mind when changing lanes, making left turns or following close behind.
“Riders can protect themselves by monitoring road and gravel conditions, manoeuvring with caution and always wearing appropriate protective gear.
“When riders and drivers are respectful and look out for each other, motorcycle season is safer for everyone.”

“Today, we join the Gujarati community in celebrating Gujarat Day. On this day in 1960, the state of Bombay was divided into regions that respected the distinct linguistic groups in India, including Gujarat.
“Gujarat has long been known for its vibrant mix of faith and cultural traditions, giving it the reputation of being ‘The Jewel of Western India.’ We join the Gujarati community in Alberta in recognizing this milestone and thank them for enriching our province’s cultural tapestry with the traditions of their homeland.   
“Normally, this day would be celebrated with parades, performances and gathering with family and friends. This year, as we stay home to keep ourselves, and those around us, safe, it can be difficult to feel like we are still connected to our community.
“However, celebrating our traditions helps us find joy and encourages us to reach out to those around us. Whether it’s through a video chat, email, or phone call, I encourage all Albertans to stay in touch with their communities.
“We must all do our part to make it through the COVID-19 pandemic and rebuild our province. Building strong relationships now will make us more resilient and better able to work together in the future.  
“However you are celebrating this year, I wish all Albertans of Gujarati heritage a happy Gujarat Day.”

Public health officials, Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and others have all worked to ensure safety precautions were implemented at the facility, identify and support those with COVID-19 and help limit the spread to other workers.
There have been 908 COVID-19 cases in workers at the plant, including 631 who have recovered.
Alberta Health Services
AHS first provided guidance to meat-processing facilities in March. As soon as the specific outbreak was identified, AHS took action to ensure outbreak control measures were implemented, support workers and limit the spread of COVID-19. 
A dedicated AHS task force is working around the clock to respond to the outbreak. This task force has worked to identify cases, support workers and the community, and has provided specific information on measures such as disinfection and staff protocols required to ensure safety.
To support and enhance safety precautions put in place by the company, AHS Environmental Public Health inspectors and Calgary zone medical officers of health have been at the Cargill site regularly since April 8 to ensure additional infection prevention and control measures are in place, and no deficiencies have been identified. These measures include:

Staff having their temperature checked before entering the facility.
Face masks and other personal protective equipment being provided to employees and worn at all times.
Ensuring enhanced cleaning and sanitizing practices are being followed.
Following new rules for staggered breaks and shift flexibility to ensure physical distancing. 
Prohibiting visitors at the facility.
Increasing distance between employees and putting screening in place between individual employee stations.
AHS officials will be on site next week to ensure that all infection prevention control measures are being followed, and provide additional assistance if needed.

AHS will also continue working with local community organizations, Primary Care Networks and the local municipalities to help support those already impacted by the outbreak. This includes:

Testing and providing medical supports for anyone in need.
Educating on how to use PPE.
Education and support for how to safely self-isolate.
Information on supports available.

To limit the spread, the Government of Alberta and AHS have secured isolation accommodation for the placement of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for Cargill workers and close contacts for the purpose of self-isolation.
Translation services are also being utilized to help explain requirements concerning self-isolation and COVID-19 testing, and to communicate the availability of other supports that may be necessary to prevent the spread of the virus.
Alberta Agriculture and Forestry and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)
COVID-19 is not a food-borne illness. That said, to support the continuous operation of Alberta’s food supply chain, Agriculture and Forestry has partnered with the CFIA to increase food inspector capacity. Provincial meat inspectors are being trained for deployment to high-priority federally licensed plants in Alberta, if needed, to maintain inspection capacity
Agriculture and Forestry has also established an intergovernmental business resumption protocol for provincially and federally licensed food processing facilities in Alberta. This protocol was the first of its kind in the country. It formalized the cooperative approach used among the various organizations to minimize disruptions in the food supply and ensure operations can safely resume as quickly as possible when there is a closure.
Occupational Health and Safety
In addition to AHS, OHS officials have visited the Cargill Ltd. beef-processing plant in High River on a number of occasions to monitor compliance with requirements to keep workers safe.
On April 15, an OHS official conducted a live, fully interactive virtual inspection of Cargill, with the inspector directing movement as required to observe employees at their daily duties. Workers, including a union representative, were included in the inspection process to ensure a fair and balanced assessment of the health and safety conditions. Virtual inspections are not specific or unique to the Cargill facility. On-site inspections were also conducted on April 27 and 29.
Officials will be on site when the plant resumes partial operations on May 4.
OHS is now conducting an investigation at the Cargill meat processing plant. This investigation will look at the circumstances surrounding potential exposure of workers at Cargill related to COVID-19. This will also include an investigation of any potential non-compliance that may have affected the health and safety of workers at the facility.
Additional supports

COVID-19 guidance documents have been made available:
	
COVID-19 Workplace Guidance for Business Owners
COVID-19 Public Health Recommendations for Food Establishments


Telephone town halls for employees and community leaders have been held with Agriculture and Forestry Minister Devin Dreeshen, Labour and Immigration Minister Jason Copping, and Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s chief medical officer of health.
Telephone town halls for employees have been held with Alberta Health Services to provide additional information, answer questions and address concerns.

Quick facts

Cargill is one of almost 200 licensed meat slaughter facilities in Alberta.
Only Cargill and JBS foods are experiencing major outbreaks.

We will support and protect vulnerable Albertans and keep them safe as we build our province back up one stage at a time.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

It is because Albertans have acted responsibly, respecting public health advice, that we have been able to limit the spread of COVID-19, keep localized outbreaks within the capacity of our health-care system, and now take the first incremental steps to reopen some businesses and services.
Early actions
The plan to move forward requires careful and ongoing monitoring and respecting all guidelines outlined by the chief medical officer of health:

Alberta Health Services will resume some scheduled, non-urgent surgeries as soon as May 4.
Dental and other health-care workers, such as physiotherapists, speech language pathologists, respiratory therapists, audiologists, social workers, occupational therapists, dieticians and more, will be allowed to resume services starting May 4, as long as they are following approved guidelines set by their professional colleges.

Recognizing the role that access to the outdoors and recreation in the outdoors plays to Albertans’ sense of well-being, access to provincial parks and public lands will be re-opened using a phased approach, beginning with:

Vehicle access to parking lots and staging areas in parks and on public lands opening May 1.
Opening a number of boat launches in provincial parks on May 1 and working to have them all open by May 14. Check albertaparks.ca for the status of boat launches.
Government is working hard to make campsites available as soon as possible, with the goal to have as many open as possible by June 1 so Albertans can enjoy our parks while adhering to current health orders. At this time, sites are open to Albertans only. Check albertaparks.ca for updates.
Group and comfort camping will not be offered. Campground facility access restrictions to areas such as showers, picnic and cooking shelters will also be posted to albertaparks.ca.
Alberta Parks’ online reservation system will be available May 14 to book site visits beginning June 1. Out-of-province bookings will not be processed.
No washrooms or garbage pickup will be available within provincial parks at this time. These services will be available as soon as Alberta Environment and Parks brings staff back. These seasonal positions represent an important opportunity for Albertans to secure employment during challenging economic times.
Fire bans in parks, protected areas and the Forest Protection Area remain in place.
No off-highway vehicle restrictions are currently in place. Local restrictions may be required if the risk for wildfires increases.
Private and municipal campgrounds and parks can open with physical distancing restrictions, under their own local authority.
Golf courses can open May 2, with restrictions including keeping clubhouses and pro shops closed. On-site shops and restaurants can open in stage one, consistent with other businesses and retailers.

Requirements to move to next stage
Additional restrictions will be lifted in stages when safe.
Before we move to stage one, several safeguards will be put in place:

Enhancing our nation-leading COVID-19 testing capacity at the highest level in Canada.
Robust and comprehensive contact tracing, aided by technology, to quickly notify people who may have been exposed.
Support for those who test positive for COVID-19, to enable isolation and effectively contain the spread.
Stronger international border controls and airport screening, especially for international travellers.
Rules and guidance for the use of masks in crowded spaces, especially on mass transit.
Maintaining strong protections for the most vulnerable, including those in long-term care, continuing care and seniors lodges.

A rapid response plan is in place in the event of possible outbreaks of COVID-19. This includes outbreak protocols to quickly identify close contacts in order to stop spread, making testing widely available including testing those without symptoms in outbreak settings, and providing temporary housing for isolation and other necessary supports for anyone at risk.
Physical distancing requirements of two metres will remain in place through all stages of relaunch and hygiene practices will continue to be required of businesses and individuals, along with instructions for Albertans to stay home when exhibiting symptoms such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose, or sore throat.

“There are signs that our collective efforts of physical distancing, good hygiene practices, and staying home when advised are helping to slow the spread. However, we must guard against complacency and be patient to ensure the sacrifices we have already made to contain the virus are not wasted by carelessness as we gradually reopen businesses and services.”
Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health

Further opening in stages
Progress to Stage 1 will occur once health measures are achieved to the satisfaction of the government based on the advice of the chief medical officer of health, as early as May 14.
Stage 1 highlights

With increased infection prevention and controls, to minimize the risk of increased transmission of infections, some businesses and facilities can start to gradually resume operations as early as May 14:


Retail businesses, such as clothing, furniture and bookstores. All vendors at farmers markets will also be able to operate.
Some personal services like hairstyling and barber shops.
Museums and art galleries.
More scheduled surgeries, dental procedures, physiotherapy, chiropractic, optometry and similar services.
Daycares and out-of-school care with limits on occupancy.
Summer camps with limits on occupancy. This could include summer school.
Cafés, restaurants (minors allowed in liquor licensed establishments) with no bar service to reopen for public seating at 50 per cent capacity.
Some additional outdoor recreation.


Post-secondary institutions will continue to deliver courses, however how programs are delivered – whether online, in-person, or a blend – will be dependent on what restrictions remain in place at each relaunch phase.


The use of masks will be strongly recommended in certain specific crowded public spaces, like mass transit, that do not allow for physical distancing (two metres apart).

Still not permitted in stage 1

Gatherings of more than 15 people. (Gatherings of 15 people or fewer must follow personal distancing and other public health guidelines.)
Arts and culture festivals, major sporting events, and concerts, all of which involve close physical contact.
Movie theatres, theatres, pools, recreation centres, arenas, spas, gyms and nightclubs will remain closed.
Visitors to patients at health-care facilities will continue to be limited.
In-school classes for kindergarten to Grade 12 students.

Recommendations

Non-essential travel, especially travel outside the province, is not recommended.
Remote working is advised where possible.


Stage 2 highlights

Timing of this stage will be determined by the success of Stage 1, considering the capacity of the health-care system and continued limiting and/or reduction of the rate of infections, hospitalization and ICU cases.
Will allow additional businesses and services to reopen and resume operations with two metre physical distancing requirements and other public health guidelines in place. This includes:


Potential kindergarten to Grade 12 schools, with restrictions.
More scheduled surgeries, including backlog elimination.
Personal services, such as artificial tanning, esthetics, cosmetic skin and body treatments, manicures, pedicures, waxing, facial treatments, massage and reflexology.
Permitting of some larger gatherings (number of people to be determined as we learn more about the levels of risk for different activities) in some situations.
Movie theatres and theatres open with restrictions.

Visitors to patients at health-care facilities will continue to be limited.
Still not permitted in stage 2

Nightclubs, gyms, pools, recreation centres, and arenas will remain closed.
Arts and culture festivals, concerts, attendance at major sporting events and other mass gatherings will continue to not be permitted.

Recommendations

Non-essential travel is not recommended.

Stage 3 highlights
Timing of this stage is to be determined based on the success of stages 1 and 2 and will involve:

Fully reopening all businesses and services, with some limited restrictions still in place.
Permitting larger gatherings (number of people to be determined).
Permitting arts and culture festivals, concerts and major sporting events with some restrictions.
Permitting nightclubs, gyms, pools, recreation centres and arenas to reopen with restrictions.
Resuming industry conferences with restrictions.
No restrictions on non-essential travel.

Quick facts

Relaunch stages will also include an evaluation and monitoring period to determine if restrictions should be adjusted up or down. Triggers that will inform decisions on the lessening or tightening of restrictions include hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy.
Confirmed cases and rates of new infections will be monitored on an ongoing basis to inform proactive responses in localized areas of the province.
Decisions will be applied at both provincial and local levels, where necessary. While restrictions are gradually eased across the province, an outbreak may mean that they need to be strengthened temporarily in a local area.
Faith-based organizations are an essential part of the lives of Albertans. They continue to be able to practice, subject to public health direction, including mass gatherings and physical distancing. Government is working with faith-based organizations to learn from past outbreaks and provide guidance related to specific practices including singing and other traditions to ensure safety while supporting social connection.

“After the fall of Saigon, 65,000 South Vietnamese were executed. One million Vietnamese were sent to prison and re-education camps, where an estimated 165,000 more people died.
“Millions of people from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos risked the open seas in overcrowded ships to find a place of safety. About a quarter-million never made it; they drowned in storms, or were murdered or sold by pirates.
“More than 120,000 of the survivors came to Canada. Churches, voluntary organizations and citizen groups adopted refugee families. For every person they took in, the federal government took care of another. As the federal Minister of Immigration, I worked with Canada’s Vietnamese community to welcome hundreds of Vietnamese boat people stranded in southeast Asia following the close of the resettlement program.
“In 2018 as Leader of the Opposition, I was pleased to table a motion in the Legislature declaring April 30th as Journey to Freedom Day in Alberta.
“As much as there is war, torment and injustice in this world, there is the greater power of generosity and compassion. Today we pay tribute to the Canadians who welcomed these refugees. We acknowledge the profound price for freedom the boat people paid, and we recognize the vibrant Vietnamese community who give so much to this province.
“Canada has always been a vision of freedom and safety for the world’s refugees. I encourage all of us to reflect on that past, and reaffirm our commitment to be a welcoming place in the future.”

Outdoor gathering and physical distancing exemptions for Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo

Due to the emergency flooding situation, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health has issued an exemption to the existing COVID-19 gathering restrictions and mandated physical distancing in outdoor spaces for individuals in the Fort McMurray area who are engaged in flood suppression and prevention activities.
It is recommended these individuals wear personal protective equipment, if available.
The safety of Albertans is our top priority, and during emergency situations like this, communities need the ability to quickly and collectively respond as a community.

Outbreak strategy

A strategy is in place to identify and respond to COVID-19 outbreaks. It involves three elements: prevention and preparedness, rapid response and timely notification, and outbreak management.

New and clarification of public orders

New public orders have been put in place to help with the continued protection of residents in long-term care and supportive living, as well as to improve their quality of life.

CMOH Order 12-2020

Effective April 29, the list of symptoms that require staff assessment and then testing is being expanded. In these facilities, anyone with even the mildest symptoms must immediately be isolated and tested for COVID-19. As soon as a COVID-19 case is identified, residents in the affected unit are now tested, even if they are feeling fine and show no symptoms. To protect the health of workers, any staff member caring for an isolated resident must also wear eye protection, along with all other appropriate PPE, including a gown, mask, visor and gloves. There is also new guidance to help support residents who wish to temporarily move into another setting like a family member’s home.

CMOH Order 14-2020

Residents in continuing care facilities, who are not in isolation, can now enjoy outdoor visits with a designated essential visitor and one other person. All appropriate precautions must be taken to prevent exposure to COVID-19 including physical distancing and requiring all visitors to wear a mask or face covering. 
Visitation circumstances where an Albertan is at the end of their life have been clarified to ensure individuals who are dying should have the opportunity to have their loved ones at their side, while following guidelines to ensure safety.

CMOH Order 13-2020

New measures for residential addiction treatment centres to prevent the risk of infection, while allowing individuals to continue to receive treatment and overcome their addiction.

Volunteer recognition program

While physical distancing and gathering restrictions are in place, there is still a need for healthy volunteers to help those in need, and countless opportunities to do so.
The Alberta Northern Lights Volunteer Awards program honours everyday heroes as the province responds to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The program is accepting nominations online.

Mental health supports
Confidential supports are available to help with mental health concerns. The Mental Health Help Line at 1-877-303-2642 and the Addiction Help Line at 1-866-332-2322 are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Online resources provide advice on handling stressful situations and ways to talk with children.
Family violence prevention

A 24-hour Family Violence Information Line is available at 310-1818 to get anonymous help in more than 170 languages.
Alberta’s One Line for Sexual Violence is available at 1-866-403-8000, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
The requirement for in-person Emergency Protection Order (EPO) applications for those fleeing family violence has been temporarily suspended; provincial courts can now hear applications for EPOs via telecommunication.
Information sheets and other resources on family violence prevention are available at alberta.ca/COVID19.

Quick facts

The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.


Any individual exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. People can access testing by completing the COVID-19 self-assessment online. A separate self-assessment tool is available for health-care and shelter workers, enforcement and first responders. After completing the form, there is no need to call 811.
All Albertans need to work together to overcome COVID-19. Albertans are asked to share acts of kindness they have experienced in their community during this difficult time by using the hashtag #AlbertaCares.

The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo issued a mandatory evacuation order for the entire community of Draper, Longboat Landing, Waterways, Ptarmigan Trailer Park and the Taiga Nova Eco-Industrial Park, and the entire lower townsite of Fort McMurray, except for the Northern Lights Regional Health Centre and Grayling Terrace. Access to the lower townsite is closed.
	
Significant resources are being dedicated to berming and sandbagging the area surrounding the Northern Lights Regional Health Centre to mitigate flood risk. There is no threat to this area at this time.


Mackenzie County has issued a mandatory evacuation order for the residents within the Hamlet of Fort Vermilion that reside east of 50th Street, north of the golf course, River Road and Boreal Housing, and all of North Vermilion (Buttertown).
Tallcree First Nation at Beaver Ranch is impacted by flooding and is being evacuated at this time.

AHS has transferred intensive care patients to other facilities as a proactive measure. AHS is prepared to send the remaining patients and long-term care residents to other facilities, but they will remain at Northern Lights Regional Health Centre as long as water levels remain stable. The facility is not experiencing any issues with staffing or supplies.

Gathering and physical distancing exemptions for Fort McMurray:

Due to the emergency flooding situation, Alberta’s chief medical officer of health has issued an exemption to the existing COVID-19 gathering restrictions and mandated physical distancing in outdoor spaces for the Fort McMurray area.
Personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves, coveralls and hand sanitizer is in the process of being sent to both Fort McMurray and Fort Vermillion.
The safety of Albertans is our top priority and during emergency situations, communities need the ability to quickly and collectively respond as a community.

Drinking water and wastewater facilities

Fort McMurray’s wastewater treatment plant has been evacuated, as the access road is flooded. It remains operational and is being monitored and operated remotely.
Due to reports of discoloration in tap water, Fort McMurray and Alberta Health Services have issued a boil water advisory for all of Fort McMurray, and rural hamlets of Anzac, Draper, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray First Nation 46 and Saprae Creek Estates.
Fort Vermilion’s water treatment plant shut down on April 28.
A boil water advisory remains in effect for Fort Vermilion.
The raw and treated water truck fill station in the Hamlet of La Crete and the Buffalo Head Prairie truck fill station are closed until further notice. Water is currently being hauled from the La Crete distribution line in order to meet water demands within the Hamlet of Fort Vermilion.
The Fort Vermilion rural truck fill is now closed until further notice, as the water treatment plant has been compromised by rising floodwaters.

River conditions – Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers

There are more open sections on the Clearwater River since April 28. Levels have been decreasing along the river at Fort McMurray.
Ice along the Clearwater River appears to be breaking up.
There is further deterioration of the ice along the Athabasca River.
On the Athabasca River, four kilometres of ice at the head of the ice jam melted through the night. The melting of the ice jam head will continue today. By the end of the day we expect the head will have passed through the community, leaving open water behind it. However, water levels will remain high until the ice moves further downstream.
Water levels have dropped half a metre at the Highway 63 bridge gauge since the evening of April 28.
If the ice at the toe of the jam releases, water levels may increase as it moves downstream.

River conditions – Peace River

The jam moved downstream April 28 at noon. Water levels have dropped more than two metres in Fort Vermilion.
The breaking ice front is downstream of the Vermilion Chutes. Flooding is expected in Garden River later this afternoon.
Water levels are expected to drop below the flood thresholds in Fort Vermilion today.

Access to justice

Due to flooding, the Fort McMurray courthouse is closed until further notice.
All matters that were to be heard there from April 28 to May 1 will be heard at St. Albert provincial court.
For questions, contact St. Albert provincial court at 780-458-7305 or the contact centre at 1-855-738-4747.
Information on the status of court matters and services is available at albertacourts.ca.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The Government of Alberta has introduced a new “low” modelling scenario estimating 298 Albertans will require hospitalization and 95 will require critical care when the virus reaches its peak. If current trends continue, this scenario will become the most likely scenario for Alberta.
Updated modelling scenarios continue to estimate that Alberta’s outbreak will reach its peak in late May. However, the number of Albertans hospitalized at the peak of the virus is predicted to be lower than originally estimated. This reflects Alberta’s experience over the past few weeks and the proportion of cases actually entering hospital and intensive care units.

“The data show us that our efforts to lower the peak of the virus are working, but we must remain vigilant. We continue to refine our modelling in order to ensure our health-care system is prepared. While we are still a ways off from returning to our normal way of life, our government is working around the clock on a phased approach to relaunch our economy safely. It is essential Albertans continue to exercise common sense and follow public health guidance so we can get the economy moving again as quickly as possible.""

Jason Kenney, Premier


As a result of aggressive public health measures put in place, the probable scenario now estimates 596 people in Alberta will require hospitalization, with 190 requiring critical care on the days when the virus reaches its peak. With Alberta’s younger-than-average population and our aggressive testing measures, which are able to catch cases with less severe symptoms, Alberta Health’s new “low” scenario is fortunately becoming our most realistic.
Alberta Health has scaled up the capacity of the province’s health-care system in order to ensure it is prepared to support patients at the peak of the pandemic in any scenario.
Existing public health measures remain in place to stop the spread of COVID-19.
 Quick facts

The model uses several key assumptions, including:
	
not all cases are detected
transmission is more common within an age group, rather than between age groups
there is no asymptomatic transmission
people are infectious for five to 10 days
all ICU patients require ventilation
overall, nine per cent of cases are hospitalized and two per cent require ICU, but this varies significantly by age. The low scenario assumes 4.5 per cent of cases are hospitalized and one per cent require ICU, which aligns with actual results.


The most important measure Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.

Drinking water and wastewater facilities

Fort McMurray’s wastewater treatment plant has been evacuated, as the access road is flooded. It remains operational and is being monitored and operated remotely.
Due to reports of discoloration in tap water, Fort McMurray and Alberta Health Services have issued a boil water advisory for all of Fort McMurray and rural hamlets of Anzac, Draper, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray First Nation 46, and Saprae Creek Estates.
The Peace River flood has caused a disruption in the water supply for the Hamlet of Fort Vermilion.
The raw and treated water truck fill station in the Hamlet of La Crete and the Buffalo Head Prairie truck fill station are closed until further notice.  Water is currently being hauled from the La Crete distribution line in order to meet water demands within the Hamlet of Fort Vermilion.
Water usage is restricted to essential use only. The Fort Vermilion water treatment plant truck fill station is inaccessible, as it is located within the mandatory evacuation area.
The Fort Vermilion rural truck fill is now closed until further notice, as the water treatment plant has been compromised by rising floodwaters.
A boil water advisory has not been issued for Fort Vermillion at this time but will be issued if conservation of drinking water and essential use is not practiced.

River conditions – Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers

The ice jam on the Athabasca River is approximately
	24 kilometres long. The ice jam stretches from kilometre 281, just upstream of Willow Island, to kilometre 305, which is by Mountain Rapids.
The ice jam has caused a rise in water levels of between 4.5 and six metres on the Athabasca River. Athabasca water levels have held steady since Sunday evening.
Clearwater River water levels have increased up to three-quarters of a metre since Sunday evening.
The ice jam had darkened yesterday significantly, indicating that melting is taking place.

River conditions – Peace River

The breaking ice front has reached Fort Vermilion and is continuing to move through town. The ice front is in place between Beaver Ranch and the downstream end of Fort Vermilion, causing flooding in both locations.
The ice is still moving in Fort Vermilion. When last observed in the early morning of April 27, the total length of the ice jam and advancing ice was approximately 38 kilometres.

Construction workers pour the final concrete to enclose the exterior of the new Calgary Cancer Centre.

Construction of the steel room, which houses the mechanical and electrical operating systems, and the exterior building envelope, which includes the installation of roofing, exterior walls, and windows, will take place next. This will seal the building from the elements and turn the construction focus to the internal construction of the health-care facility.   
About 7,600 construction-related jobs have been created as the result of the Calgary Cancer Centre infrastructure project.

“Achieving today’s construction milestone under the present circumstances is a remarkable achievement and is a testament to Alberta contractors and tradespeople. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 1,000 workers are working on site each day, keeping this important $1.41 billion project on schedule and budget.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure


“This is great news for patients in Calgary and all of southern Alberta.  Progress on the Calgary Cancer Centre is a great reminder that we’re moving forward with key investments for the future while we respond to the COVID-19 emergency. Patients with cancer and other diseases need care, and the health system will be there for them.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Over the next couple of months, work on the building’s interior will increase as all of its floors become accessible. Construction activity will focus on the installation of electrical and mechanical systems, studs and drywall, and completion of the radiation therapy vaults.
The Government of Alberta in conjunction with public health officials will carefully monitor worksites across the province through the COVID pandemic to ensure the construction season proceeds while keeping workers safe. This will help ensure that not a single day of the construction season is lost and keep workers safe and construction sites open.
The protocols include:

Maintaining separation of at least six feet between workers.
Avoiding in-person meetings when possible. If held, the number of attendees should be limited and workers are required to maintain separation.
Ensuring personal hygiene practices and job sanitation measures have and continue to be implemented.
Directing anyone exhibiting flu-like symptoms not to come to work and to self-isolate for 14 days.

Quick facts

More than 124,000 cubic metres of concrete has been poured in the Calgary Cancer Centre project. Construction activity will continue until late 2022.

“Every year on April 28, we observe the National Day of Mourning to honour and pay tribute to those who have lost their lives, have been injured or suffered a work-related illness. My thoughts are with these workers, their families, friends and colleagues.
“In 2019, 165 Albertans either didn’t make it home from work or succumbed to workplace illnesses or injuries. These Albertans were more than just workers. They were parents, partners, siblings, sons, daughters, neighbours and friends. Their absence leaves huge holes in many lives and throughout our communities.
“I recognize this is a difficult day for many. This year is especially difficult given the current COVID-19 pandemic. While we cannot gather to hold ceremonies this year, I know the memories of loved ones will live on in the hearts of many.
“This year, this day also serves as a reminder of the work being done by front-line workers. I want to thank and honour all essential workers who are helping provide critical services to Albertans during this challenging time. Our government appreciates the dedication of these workers and we are all grateful for all their hard work during these unprecedented times.
“Today reminds us that employers, workers and government all have the responsibility to create healthy and safe workplaces. We are committed to protecting workers and preventing further workplace tragedies.”

“Education Week runs from April 27 to May 1 this year and I am especially proud to pay tribute to teachers, education partners, parents and family members for their support for students during this unprecedented time.
“The theme of Education Week is ‘Learning is a Journey’ and educators and parents across Alberta have truly gone the extra mile to ensure their students and children continue to learn during the COVID-19 pandemic. While I realize our temporary normal is not the same as being in school, we will continue to put the safety of students and staff first, and give school authorities the flexibility to do what is best in their communities. Together, we will get through this.
“I want to thank Albertans who have brought collaboration and innovation to new levels during the past several weeks. While we may not be able to celebrate this important week in the ways we normally would, I do hope that everyone finds an opportunity to recognize the important role Alberta’s diverse and robust education system plays in the success of our province.”

A variety of efforts are being made to support vulnerable and at-risk Albertans feeling the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Government is prioritizing support for those who need it most, including people with disabilities, people accessing income support programs, homeless and women’s shelters, and civil society organizations that support Albertans, including food banks.

“Our government is committed to slowing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting vulnerable Albertans. Those who rely on social services need our support more than ever before and we will continue working closely with community partners to address the needs of all who are at risk and help them get through this challenging time.”
Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services

Support is being provided to the disability community to help navigate this crisis. Programs such as Family Support for Children with Disabilities (FSCD), Persons with Developmental Disabilities (PDD) and Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) are still available during the pandemic.
Government is working with disability service provider partners to provide personal protective equipment, help maintain staffing, and develop policies to allow for easier access to supports and help ensure the well-being of individuals and families. A reference guide on COVID-19 for people with disabilities has also been developed to provide information on how to stay safe and limit the spread of the virus. This guide is available online.

“COVID-19 is posing profound and immediate hardship for many Albertans with disabilities and their families. We are encouraged by the government's growing spirit of collaboration and new measures taken to address specific needs of disabled Albertans. Working together, we can continue to support those most in need now, and be proactive in addressing the post-COVID-19 recovery.”
Lyndon Parakin, vice-president, Autism Society Alberta

Alberta Supports contact centres remain open, with services accessible by phone or online. Monthly benefits continue to be provided to Albertans accessing AISH and Income Support during the pandemic. Government will be exempting a portion of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) as income for AISH and Income Support recipients.

“These are difficult times for all Albertans, including people with disabilities who have lost employment. I’m pleased the government took action to exempt a portion of CERB for Albertans receiving AISH to replace some of the income they’ve lost. This will help them deal with the challenges they’re facing.”
Margot Brunner-Campbell, executive director, Voice of Albertans with Disabilities

Homeless shelters and community organizations have received financial support to open 14 new shelter facilities to meet physical distancing requirements and are now focusing their efforts on re-housing to take people out of the shelter system. More than 400 people have been housed since the beginning of this crisis.

“We are focusing our efforts to support people without a fixed-address during this pandemic and empower them to move into their own homes. During this crisis, we have not lost sight of our housing efforts and our goal to end chronic homelessness. We appreciate the support of government during this time and will continue to work together to support our most vulnerable people.” 
Sandra Clarkson, executive director, Calgary Drop In Centre

Women’s emergency shelters are helping to protect women and children experiencing domestic violence by providing safe isolation in hotels, adjusting programming to meet physical distancing requirements and hiring additional staff so they can respond to increased crisis calls, while continuing to provide supports to women and children.
Government has received 850 applications for the $30 million in funding from charities, not-for-profits and civil society organizations from across the province. These applications are currently being reviewed and urgent requests are being prioritized to deliver the most effective support to vulnerable Albertans.
Government also recently provided $5 million to help food banks and charities provide Albertans with food during this crisis. This funding helps ensure safe food distribution to Alberta’s food banks and will assist with efforts to respond to COVID-19.
More information about government’s response to COVID-19 can be found at Alberta.ca/COVID19.
Quick facts

About 17 per cent of AISH and six per cent of Income Support recipients earn employment income, in addition to monthly financial benefits they receive from the provincial government.
CERB is for Canadians who have lost employment income due to COVID-19. Eligible Canadians can receive $500 a week for up to 16 weeks from the federal government.
194 hotel rooms for people in shelters, who test positive for the virus, have been identified across the province, in addition to 200 spaces at the Edmonton EXPO Centre.
27 grants have been provided to currently funded women’s shelters to support their COVID-19 response.
As of April 21, 850 applications for emergency funding for social services support have been received from charities, not-for-profits and civil society organizations across the province.
As of April 21, 49 applications for food bank funding have been received.

#MuseumFromHome began to trend after museums around the world closed to help slow the spread of COVID-19. From the Louvre to the Museum of Modern Art, curators around the world have been entertaining and educating millions of at-home viewers by uploading virtual tours, interesting and entertaining facts, and never-before-seen content of their collections.
Alberta’s provincial historic sites and museums will be joining the #MuseumFromHome movement with new digital content uploaded every week – from educational content, to crafts for kids, to exclusive tours by museum staff. The campaign kicks off with an interview between Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women Leela Sharon Aheer and the Royal Alberta Museum about their immense bug collection.

“Our historic sites and museums may be temporarily closed for public safety, but our dedicated staff have created new ways to connect with Albertans and museum lovers around the world. We are going to show off what makes Alberta amazing and why everyone should visit Alberta, our sites and museums once they open again.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Many Alberta businesses have been required to close or limit their operations in order to protect public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in revenues being drastically reduced and in difficulties for many job creators.
The new Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program will give certainty to small businesses by providing 50 per cent of monthly commercial rental costs. Eligible landlords and tenants would each be responsible for 25 per cent of the remaining costs.

“We know a number of Alberta’s businesses are struggling during the pandemic. Our partnership with the federal government will provide much-needed relief to small businesses on their rental payments. Small businesses create jobs – and are extremely important for our communities and our economy.”

Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism



“Many of Alberta’s businesses have been taking measures that affect their bottom line in order to protect public health and we recognize this contribution. In addition to small businesses, rent relief is on its way to charities and non-profits – which provide critical services in our communities, especially during these difficult times.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

About the CECRA:

CECRA will provide a loan retroactive to April 1 to qualified commercial property owners supporting 50 per cent of rent for April, May, and June of this year.
The loan will be forgivable if the property owner and tenant come to a rent forgiveness agreement that lowers the eligible small business’s rent by 75 per cent for the three months and includes a moratorium on eviction.
The program is anticipated to be running by mid-May and will be administered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).
Qualifying small businesses will be required to:
	
pay less than $50,000 in rent
have been asked to close, or near-close their operations due to COVID-19
be experiencing at least a 70 per cent decrease in revenues


CECRA will also be available to non-profit and charitable organizations.
The province expects to commit up to $67 million, with the remaining and majority of costs being covered by the federal government.

Further details on CECRA will be shared by CMHC in the coming weeks when final terms and conditions are available. Until that time, property owners are encouraged to provide flexibility to tenants facing hardship in this uncertain time.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Premier Jason Kenney has appointed former Member of Parliament and business executive James Rajotte to lead Alberta’s office in Washington, effective May 1. Rajotte’s primary responsibility will be to bring Alberta’s voice to policy makers at both the national and state levels, as we explore North American energy security and deal collaboratively with threats to our markets from overseas.

“The crisis in our energy industry underscores the need for Alberta to have strong relations with policy makers and business leaders in the United States. Alberta exports to the U.S. a total of more than $100 billion, nearly 90 per cent of Alberta’s exports to the world. It’s central that we have a strong voice to represent Alberta’s vital economic interests in Washington, D.C. James Rajotte will fill that role perfectly. As chairman of the House of Commons Finance Committee during the global financial crisis, he has first-hand experience dealing with a crisis like the one we are in. Mr. Rajotte has deep and long-standing connections in the U.S. Congress and a tremendous understanding of the critical issues Alberta is facing.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

In addition to advancing the idea of a North American energy strategy, Rajotte will play a vital advocacy role in the post-COVID-19 recovery period, while seeking opportunities to facilitate investment, bilateral trade, and strengthening relations. The senior representative reports to the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism.

“We must build stronger ties between Alberta and the U.S. following the pandemic. Our economic and supply chain integration is broad and deep, crossing nearly every sector – most notably agriculture and energy – and generates employment for millions of workers on both sides of the border. James is the right person for that role.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism


“I am honoured to have been chosen by Premier Kenney to take on this important assignment during these challenging times. More than ever, I see this as an opportunity to advance Alberta’s long-standing relationship with the U.S. to decision makers, both at the national and state level. I look forward to representing our province in Washington, D.C.”
James Rajotte, Alberta’s senior representative to the U.S.


“I have known James for many years. I had the pleasure of working with him on behalf of Edmontonians and Albertans when we both served as MPs. Although we come from different political parties, I can say that James never let partisanship get in the way of working with others on behalf of all Canadians. He will be an effective, hard-working representative for Alberta’s interests in the United States.”
Hon. Anne McLellan, former deputy prime minister


“I know I speak for our members when I say that we are delighted with the choice of James Rajotte for Alberta’s representative in Washington, DC. We have known and worked with James for years during his time as a Canadian member of Parliament, and can personally attest to his leadership and political savvy, qualities he will need for this new assignment. We look forward to welcoming James in Washington and working together on the key issues that face Alberta in the United States.”
Gary Clement, chairman of the board, Canada American Business Council


“For 15 years, over five terms as a member of Parliament from Alberta, James Rajotte earned a sterling reputation across all party lines for his policy acumen, decency, and ability to work with others towards a shared goal. Creating Alberta jobs through trade with the United States under our renewed free trade agreement will be an essential part of Alberta’s economic renewal. James Rajotte is an outstanding representative for Alberta, and Canada, in Washington. He will, as he always has, work hard and deliver results for Alberta.”
James Moore, former minister of industry and member of Canada’s NAFTA Council


“In the years I have worked with James, he has gained my respect and trust. I have always appreciated his honesty and his sense of ethics, a rare combination in federal politics.”
Guy Caron, former parliamentary leader for Canada’s New Democrats and MP for Rimouski-Neigette-Témiscouata-Les Basques

Since 2004, Alberta’s presence in the U.S. capital has advanced Alberta’s shared economic objectives with U.S. decision makers. Alberta's envoys to the U.S. have managed this important relationship from the Alberta Washington D.C. Office, which is co-located within the Canadian embassy. Alberta’s senior representative will receive a biweekly salary of $9,634.85.
Biography for James Rajotte
Born and raised in Edmonton, James Rajotte holds BA and MA degrees from the University of Alberta. He has worked for several years as the vice-president at Rogers Communications, responsible for provincial and municipal government affairs across Canada. 
He has served in a volunteer capacity on the Board of Governors of the University of Alberta, and on the Board of Directors of the Alberta Enterprise Group, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Imagine Canada, and the Wood Buffalo Economic Development Corporation.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The Site Rehabilitation Program – mainly funded by the federal government’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan – will provide grants to oilfield service contractors to perform well, pipeline, and oil and gas site reclamation work. Starting now, the program is expected to create about 5,300 direct jobs and lead to the cleanup of thousands of sites.
This work will be done in Alberta, putting Albertans back to work. The program will also provide additional economic benefits, such as indirect employment, helping support various sectors of Alberta’s economy – including restaurant and hotel workers, and many other businesses – as it begins to reopen and recover after the effects of COVID-19.

“Alberta’s energy industry is the largest subsector of Canada’s economy, as well as one of its biggest job creators. We are creating almost 5,300 jobs for Alberta’s energy workers, while completing important work decommissioning and reclaiming abandoned pump jacks, pipelines and wells. This will ensure that sites are properly addressed, benefiting landowners and Albertans across the province.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy

This program will launch on May 1, with an initial focus on providing grants to service companies that have been significantly impacted by the unprecedented economic downturn. The program will provide funds in $100-million increments.
The first $100 million will be available for service companies to do eligible work anywhere in the province. Future increments may be allocated for work conducted in specific regions within the province, directing funds where they can have the most significant environmental benefits.
All laws, regulations, directives, and environmental and occupational health and safety standards, including physical distancing and COVID-19-related health guidelines, must be followed in carrying out the work.
Quick facts

The Site Rehabilitation Program will provide grants of between 25 and 100 per cent of total project costs – depending on the ability of the oil and gas company responsible for the site to help pay for cleanup – and will be paid directly to the oilfield service company completing the work.
Contractors can apply for a grant online during the following dates and must meet all eligibility and project requirements:


May 1-31: Open to service companies significantly impacted by the unprecedented economic downturn for contracts of up to $30,000 per application across Alberta. This $100-million increment will focus on projects that are eligible for 100 per cent government funding.
May 15 to June 15: Open to service companies for contracts of up to $30,000 and eligible for 100 per cent funding. This $100-million increment will focus on sites where some operators have failed landowners and where government is paying compensation to landowners as required under the Surface Rights Act.
Future increments will be developed for larger projects.
Application and eligibility information, as well as the online application portal, is available at alberta.ca/siterehab.


Grant-funded work must be done in Alberta, putting Albertans to work.
Eligible work includes:


closure work on inactive wells and pipelines, including remediation and reclamation
removal of abandoned in-place pipelines
Phase 1 and 2 environmental site assessments


Alberta has a strong regulatory system requiring that the thousands of oil and gas structures across the province – including pump jacks, pipelines, and wells – be properly decommissioned and their sites brought back to a land condition similar to the state they were in before the infrastructure was built. This work ensures that the sites are safe for landowners and Albertans and there are no negative impacts to the environment.

“A horrific new chapter in human suffering began 105 years ago when the Ottoman government launched the systematic deportation and extermination of Armenians.
“No one was spared. More than one million people – men and women, children and the elderly – were slaughtered outright or died from forced marches and disease. This mass murder was accompanied by robbery, rape and starvation on a massive scale.
“Genocide has deeply scarred the Armenian people. It is imperative that we, and all free peoples, preserve the memory of the atrocities inflicted on them.
“To all Albertans of Armenian descent, we join you in profound grief for the families destroyed and the history lost. Like you, we will not forget. Like you, we will bear witness.”

Latest updates

Cases have been identified in all zones across the province:
	
2,633 cases in the Calgary zone
454 cases in the Edmonton zone
373 cases in the South zone
157 cases in the North zone
80 cases in the Central zone
23 cases in zones yet to be confirmed


Of these cases, there are currently 72 people in hospital, 18 of whom have been admitted to intensive care units (ICU).
313 cases are suspected of being community acquired.
The total deaths are: 42 in the Calgary zone; 14 in the North zone; nine in the Edmonton zone; one in the Central zone; and two in the South zone.
To date, 390 cases have been confirmed at continuing care facilities, and 44 residents at these facilities have died.
There have been 112,562 people tested for COVID-19 and a total of 117,835 tests performed by the lab. In the last 24 hours, 4,336 tests have been completed.
Any individual exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath, is eligible for testing. People can access testing by completing the COVID-19 self-assessment online. A separate self-assessment tool is available for health-care and shelter workers, enforcement and first responders.

Major summer events

Alberta’s chief medical officer of health has confirmed that gathering restrictions currently in place also apply to all one-time or annual summer events, including arts and culture festivals, agricultural fairs and rodeos, major sporting championships and industry conferences.
The orders in place prohibit gatherings of 15 or more people. They also require people gathered in groups of fewer than 15 to maintain a distance of two metres from one another.
By clarifying these restrictions now, organizers will be able to provide advance notice of 60 days or more that may help them limit unrecoverable expenditures, and cancel contracts in a timely manner.
The Alberta government is working with major event organizers to ensure they understand the restrictions, to help mitigate the impacts of cancellations wherever possible, and to look for innovative ways to highlight Alberta arts and culture online.
These restrictions will continue to apply until evidence demonstrates that the spread is controlled.

Voluntary tracing app coming soon

To help enhance and complement contract tracing, the Government of Alberta has developed a mobile contract tracing application: AB TraceTogether. The app is in the final testing phase and is expected to be available to all Albertans in the coming weeks.
Strong tracing and tracking of contacts - leveraging technology - can be an important tool to augment manual contact tracing while limiting the spread of COVID-19. Being contacted earlier will allow individuals to take action sooner to prevent the spread.
This app, which will be available to all Albertans for voluntary download, will help Albertans protect themselves, their loved ones and their community, while maintaining their privacy.

Getting outdoors

As the temperature rises, Albertans may want to get outdoors to improve both physical and mental health, but they should keep in mind recommendations about physical distancing.
Albertans can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by following all public health orders when outdoors. Restrictions on events, gatherings and certain types of businesses are in place to limit situations where COVID-19 could be transmitted through contact with an infected individual or through contact with frequently touched surfaces and objects.
More details, including examples of activities that can be done while maintaining physical distancing, can be found online at https://www.alberta.ca/coronavirus-info-for-albertans.aspx

Volunteer opportunities during COVID-19

Albertans who are healthy and looking to help others can visit the new Alberta Cares Connector website to find or post volunteer opportunities. They can also call Alberta 211’s resource and referral network.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




In fall 2019, government launched a review to examine concerns from consumer representatives about certain parties gaining too much control of Alberta’s electricity market following the expiry of Power Purchase Arrangements (PPAs). At the same time, electricity suppliers raised concerns about unnecessary market control mitigation strategies.
The review – which included stakeholder feedback and advice submitted by the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) – concluded that the province’s existing policy and legislative framework is effective and will continue to restrict the abuse of electricity market control in the future.
The review also highlighted opportunities to provide clarity and certainty to the role of the Market Surveillance Administrator (MSA) and its oversight of the electricity market. To bring a renewed focus to this role, government has appointed Derek Olmstead as administrator for an interim period of nine months.
In this role, Olmstead will focus on the important work of market surveillance and enforcement, providing greater clarity and certainty for Alberta’s competitive electricity market participants and investors. The appointment is effective immediately.

“Our government promised to ensure a fair and competitive electricity market for Alberta consumers and job creators. Establishing and maintaining clear roles for our agencies increases investor confidence and market stability in our electricity system. I would like to thank Gordon Kaiser, outgoing administrator, for his service.”
Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity


“Alberta’s power market has worked to meet our province’s demand, to provide consumers with choice, and to provide the downward pressure of competition on power prices. We welcome Dr. Olmstead to this role and we welcome the government’s commitment to ensure efficient and complementary agency oversight of the market.”
Evan Bahry, Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta

Government will continue to review Alberta’s electricity agencies, including the MSA, to ensure they are accountable, fulfil their intended purpose, and operate in the best interest of Albertans.
Quick facts

Alberta’s electricity markets operate under the principles of fair, efficient, and open competition. The Fair, Efficient and Open Competition Regulation restricts any one electricity supplier from holding market control greater than 30 per cent of the market’s total generating capacity.
Alberta has four electricity agencies:
	
Alberta Utilities Commission
Alberta Electric System Operator
Market Surveillance Administrator
Balancing Pool


The MSA is an independent enforcement agency that exists under the Alberta Utilities Commission Act. It is responsible for protecting and promoting the fair, efficient, and openly competitive operation of Alberta’s wholesale electricity market and retail markets for natural gas and electricity.
Derek Olmstead has significant experience within the electricity sector, including as director of enforcement at the MSA. His appointment is for a period of nine months – concluding on Jan. 21, 2021 – while recruitment takes place.

“Today, we join with the more than 100,000 of our Muslim neighbours, co-workers and friends in recognizing the start of Ramadan, Islam’s holiest and most solemn month of the year.
“This year, our Muslim neighbours, like so many others, are constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic from coming together in communal prayer and to share a meal after dusk with friends and extended family. My sincere thanks go out to the Imams and community leaders who have been complying with necessary health restrictions and restricting gatherings at this holy time.
“Alberta’s Islamic community is comprised of people from many backgrounds, and it is a proud note in our history that the Al-Rashid Mosque in Edmonton was Canada’s first mosque, and was built with the support of Albertans of many faiths.
“Ramadan is a time of spiritual discipline and self-denial, when Muslims demonstrate great devotion to the primacy of the spiritual over the material.
“On behalf of Albertans everywhere, I wish all our Muslim neighbours a blessed and peaceful Ramadan. May you experience renewal and stay safe during this time of fasting and prayer.”

While physical distancing and gathering restrictions are in place, there is still a need for healthy volunteers to help those in need with countless opportunities to do so. The Alberta Cares Connector embraces the Alberta spirit of supporting the vulnerable by offering our assistance, skills and time to those who need it most.

“Volunteerism is the Alberta way. I continue to be inspired by many acts of Albertan generosity and compassion. From the Sikh community providing meals for truckers keeping our supply lines open, to a Calgary woman in her time of mourning sewing masks for her community, to kids leaving care packages on their elderly neighbours’ doorsteps – the examples of generosity and selflessness are endless. The Alberta Cares Connector will build off this community solidarity and ensure that those who can help will make the biggest impact during this time when support is acutely needed. The Northern Lights program keeps a platform commitment to spotlight those who personify the Alberta sprit by giving back to our community through volunteerism.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Volunteers are the foundation for many community organizations providing social support and assistance to those in need. Alberta has more than 26,400 non-profit organizations and, each year, more than 1.6 million Albertans provide more than 262 million volunteer hours to support the non-profit and voluntary sector at a value of $5.6 billion.

“Albertans are proud to have the highest volunteer rates across Canada, and we take action in countless ways to meet the needs of our communities and neighbours. During this unprecedented crisis, Albertans understand that the need for volunteerism and social support is urgent. And, once again, they have demonstrated their commitment to their neighbours and communities through selfless acts of service. The Alberta Cares Connector will assist Albertans who want to help at this time by connecting them with local volunteer opportunities to help those most in need.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women

This new tool will build on the success of every day Albertans who answered the call to action by providing an easy one-stop-shop for those looking for service opportunities. The Alberta Cares Connector will ensure those organizations and programs that depend on the generosity and assistance of volunteers are able to continue to provide support to those in need.

“We are thrilled about our collaboration with the province on the new Alberta Cares Connector. We've supported volunteering through floods and fires and built a platform that could be flexible to allow volunteers to rise to any challenge. Alberta Cares Connector will continue to evolve and create new ways for community organizations to connect with current and prospective volunteers who want to answer the call to help others in need.”
Doug Watson, president and CEO, Volunteer Centre of Calgary

Volunteers and volunteer organizations must follow all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to protect themselves and those they help. More information on safety and physical distancing guidelines can be found at alberta.ca/COVID19.
Ways people can help

Volunteering at food banks.
Sewing masks for Albertans or scrub bags for front-line workers.
Providing meals for essential service workers, like truckers.
Picking up groceries for those unable to leave their homes.
Packing and delivering essential needs for vulnerable Albertans.
Donating blood through myaccount.blood.ca.
Donating items to shelters in need.
Reaching out to seniors through positive messages or phone calls.

Northern Lights Volunteer Recognition Program
Government is also launching the Alberta Northern Lights Volunteer Awards to honour everyday heroes as the province responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. The honourees will be nominated by fellow Albertans and selected for profiling on the program’s website and through social media.
There are no requirements for hours of service, and any individual or group who helps out in their community is eligible for an award. The nomination submission requests a brief story about the nominee’s contribution. Nominations will be accepted online on an ongoing basis.

“Volunteers are the heart of non-profits and right now we need Albertans to give their time and talents to community organizations. Any act of volunteerism, done safely, will make a huge difference. That’s why the Government of Alberta is making a point of recognizing those individuals, businesses and organizations who have answered the call in this time of need. Let’s share the uplifting and inspirational stories of special volunteers who are brightening the lives of others and their communities during this difficult time by nominating them for an Alberta Northern Lights Volunteer Award. ”
Jeremy Nixon, parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Community and Social Services

The program is now accepting nominations.

“On this sombre day, we remember the six million Jewish people murdered in the Holocaust by the Nazis and their collaborators. This is a wound that will not heal. This is a crime that cannot be forgotten. The memory of the six million will be with us, always.
“But today is also a time for resolve. Nazism showed the world the depths to which anti-Semitism can sink. Across Alberta we are determined to fight that evil in all its forms. We will never let it take root here and spread.
“Our province is proud to be a home for the Jewish people, and we are just as proud to honour the six million by standing shoulder-to-shoulder with their children against the poison of anti-Semitism.
“I salute Albertans of the Jewish faith for your courage and commitment to keeping the bitter lessons of the Shoah alive.
I encourage all Albertans to join the virtual commemoration being hosted by the Holocaust Centre at 5 p.m. MT.”

Supports include additional funding to allow for:

Increased health-care aide staffing levels.
A wage top-up of an additional $2 per hour for health-care aides.
Up to 1,000 paid student practicum positions to fast-track certification and get more staff into our continuing care facilities.

In addition, $24.5 million is being advanced to operators to help address immediate cost pressures due to COVID-19.

“Health-care aides are integral to the well-being of residents – and they play a critical role across the health-care system. We cannot overlook their contribution, and we must not lose sight of how the pressures they face can directly impact the functioning of entire facilities. We are confident that these measures will make a difference not only to health-care aides, but to the residents of these facilities who deserve quality and compassionate care.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Continuing care facilities have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is why strong restrictions are in place to address the spread of the virus. These restrictions are necessary to help protect lives, but they also place financial and emotional burdens on staff, residents and operators.
Increased funding will help facilities hire about 1,000 additional full-time staff so they can adequately prevent infections and respond to outbreaks. The addition of 1,000 practicum students will also help deal with staffing shortages across the system. A wage supplement will help compensate health-care aides at contracted sites for the extra work necessary during this pandemic. It will also help alleviate the financial burden for those who normally work at several sites, but are now restricted to one site.
These new measures are estimated to cost an additional $7.3 million per month and are specific support for the pandemic period.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Alberta has a duty to consult Indigenous communities when natural development projects could adversely affect their use of Crown lands. The Alberta government, through the Aboriginal Consultation Office (ACO), is allowing participating Indigenous communities to add days to the consultation process, if needed, during the pandemic response – up to 10 days for Levels 1 and 2 consultations, and up to 15 for Level 3.
This way, development projects on Crown lands that have met adequate consultation requirements for regulatory approval can move ahead and keep Albertans working while limiting harm to essential workers and the capacity strain in Indigenous communities.

“With fewer resources available to manage consultations on natural resource development projects while responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, Indigenous communities should not have to choose between safety and prosperity. Timeline extensions can slow the pace enough to allow for good consultation practices.”
Rick Wilson, Minister of Indigenous Relations

Consultation pauses will still be available as a last option for Indigenous communities that need them.
Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

This year’s theme is “It’s time to applaud this country’s volunteers.” The province provided $65,000 to Volunteer Alberta to support 77 applications for community celebrations to recognize volunteers. Instead of gatherings and events, communities have alternate plans to mark the seven-day salute to volunteerism. These local efforts also help encourage volunteerism.

“Volunteers are at the heart of Alberta communities, supporting recreational, cultural and social programs that enhance our quality of life. In these unprecedented times, they are also the foundation of our COVID-19 pandemic response. We are grateful for the outpouring of love and acts of kindness from so many volunteers helping their neighbours stay connected and feel supported during this challenging time. Let’s join together to celebrate and thank them during National Volunteer Week and encourage others to explore volunteerism.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women

Celebrate Alberta’s volunteers while physical distancing

Highlight individuals, teams or projects by sharing volunteer stories through video and photos on social media or other platforms.
Email a volunteer with a personalized thank you or provide gift cards for takeout as a token of recognition.
Write a reference letter for a volunteer who is applying for a job, internship or school program.
Nominate an outstanding volunteer for an award such as Stars of Alberta to formally recognize their efforts.

Volunteers are the foundation for many community organizations with limited or no paid staff. Alberta has more than 26,400 non-profit organizations and, each year, more than 1.6 million Albertans provide more than 262 million volunteer hours to support the non-profit and voluntary sector at a value of $5.6 billion.
The province also provides ongoing support through funding, organizational and leadership development supports for non-profit and voluntary sector organizations. Volunteer recognition programs such as the Stars of Alberta also provide annual recognition of Alberta’s exceptional volunteers.

All workers from all companies at outbreak sites will be offered this opportunity.
Additionally, Alberta’s testing capacity is rapidly expanding and anyone with symptoms anywhere in the province can now be tested.
Those with symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat, or shortness of breath, should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment. After completing the form, there is no need to call 811.
Alberta’s testing capacity is currently approximately 7,000 samples per day, and the laboratory network is working to increase this capacity.

Camping reservations temporarily suspended

Alberta Parks has suspended online campsite reservations and is refunding customers who have booked up to May 19.
The decision is in line with other jurisdictions, such as Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Parks Canada, which have also suspended or delayed camping reservations.

Wastewater management

As the regulator of municipal wastewater systems, Environment and Parks is aware of reports from municipalities that some homeowners are flushing inappropriate items down toilets, such as disinfectant wipes or paper towels.
Albertans should avoid flushing items not intended for toilets because they can block sanitary lines, create service disruptions and cause sewer backups.

Temporary suspension of applications for emergency social services funding

Effective April 21 at 6 p.m., the Government of Alberta will be temporarily suspending applications for emergency social services funding to charities, not-for-profits and civil society organizations to support their COVID-19 response.

“How we come through this economic crisis will depend in large part on the survival and the successful recovery of our country’s largest industry – the energy sector – on which some 800,000 Canadian jobs depend. We thank the federal government for taking this important first step to support the folks who work in our energy sector.
“The $1 billion partnership to address inactive wells aligns with Alberta’s commitment to ensuring our resources are developed in an environmentally sustainable fashion. This funding will immediately save or create thousands of jobs, keeping energy service companies going during these devastating times. It will also help us bring sites back to their original condition, leaving a cleaner environment for future generations. The $200 million loan to the Orphan Well Association will also help these efforts, demonstrating our commitment to producing Canadian energy under the world’s highest environmental standards.
“More support is needed to deal with the crisis in Canada’s energy sector, but this is a great first step. Our energy sector is facing its biggest challenge ever, and we need to be sure that industry can access the capital it needs to survive and thrive in future years. When the auto sector and the banks were threatened during the global financial crisis a decade ago, the economic strength of Alberta, powered by the energy industry, ensured that Canada was able to provide the urgent support they needed. We will continue to work with the federal government to ensure that the energy sector now gets the support it needs as it faces its own threats from both the COVID-19 pandemic and the Saudi-Russia price war.
“This unprecedented disruption in the world energy markets will eventually recede. Better times for the industry are a matter of when – not if – but only if the industry survives the next couple of years. We need to make sure Alberta is prepared and ready for the global recovery when the time comes. Alberta’s energy industry is the lifeblood of our provincial economy – and the largest subsector of Canada’s economy, as well as one of its biggest employers. The energy sector helps some of our country’s most important industries thrive, including health care, manufacturing and transportation.
“We are grateful for this job-creating initiative, and we will continue to work with the federal government until the energy sector has what it needs to survive and thrive for the benefit of all Canadians.”

“On this day 35 years ago, Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into effect.
“Section 15 lays out our equality rights in Canada. We are proud that everyone is equal under the law and that everyone has the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law in this great nation of Canada. We do not tolerate discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical disability.
“We owe this to women across Canada, who gathered at the Women and the Constitution conference in 1981 to lobby for these provisions and for them to apply equally to men and women.
“Strong and resilient Alberta women played a critical role in this decision. In 1973, Irene Murdoch, a farm wife from Alberta, claimed half her family’s ranch in her divorce. She was initially denied on the grounds that a wife’s routine work did not justify a share in the property. Her perseverance was a catalyst to reform family law in Canada.
“This case, along with others, inspired women such as Doris Anderson from Medicine Hat to take a stand. As the editor of Chatelaine, she was passionate about women’s issues and realized the opportunity to amend the charter to protect and empower women. Through advocacy and community leadership, she helped make Section 15 a reality.
“Today, let’s celebrate and draw inspiration from the women who saw, created, and then seized the opportunity to make this country better for each other and all Canadians.”

The decision is in line with other jurisdictions, such as Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Parks Canada, which have also suspended or delayed camping reservations.
The suspension is in place until the province’s chief medical officer of health is confident the health and public safety risk from COVID-19 is reduced.
Existing camping reservations to May 19
The online reservation system is temporarily closed and no longer accessible for customers to cancel bookings on their own. Alberta Parks will begin notifying customers with existing reservations up to May 19 through a system-generated email. All fees paid will be refunded. Customers are advised that refunds may occur in multiple transactions. For example, reservation or change fees may be refunded separately from camping fees. Transactions may take up to two weeks for processing.
Camping reservations after May 19
Additional cancellations, including those after May 19, will be announced in the future as government continues to assess the pandemic situation on the advice of the chief medical officer of health.
Random camping on public land
Dispersed random camping on public land is currently permitted, but further restrictions may be necessary in the future as the COVID-19 situation continues to unfold. Campers should be aware that a fire and recreational off-highway vehicle (OHV) ban is currently in place in the Forest Protection Area. All random campers must follow the directions of the chief medical officer of health, including physical distancing and no mass gatherings.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The goal of this response plan is to protect workers, while ensuring limited impact to our essential food supply during this pandemic.
Background
It is critical to remember that COVID-19 is not a foodborne illness. But essential food industry workers are still susceptible to COVID-19, just like everyone else. Across North America, we have seen a growing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at food processing plants as the total number of cases throughout society also grows.
In Alberta, the first confirmed case occurred at a beef plant north of Calgary. The facility where the case was confirmed was shut down, halting production. Agriculture and Forestry immediately began working with the plant management, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Alberta Health Services (AHS) and the Ministry of Labour to resolve the issue. Specific, effective mitigation measures were put in place based on the advice of health and safety experts.
Developments
Since this first case, Alberta Agriculture and Forestry has continued to work with our partners, AHS and the CFIA to protect the health and safety of workers while ensuring a stable food supply in Alberta.
Together, we have established an intergovernmental business resumption protocol for provincially or federally licensed food processing facilities in Alberta. This protocol formalizes the cooperative approach used among the organizations to streamline the process while outlining the roles and responsibilities of AF, AHS and CFIA as we work to keep our food supply strong.
The principles of the protocol were applied at Cargill Beef when the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed there on April 6. We are proud of the fact that this protocol has already proven effective in advance of it being formally signed by all parties. It also complements orders issued by Alberta’s chief medical officer of health under the Public Health Act.

“Food production is an essential service. The employees in Alberta’s food processing industry are still hard at work every day, and thanks to them our food supply chain is strong. This new plan we’ve developed will help keep them safe – while they keep us fed during the pandemic.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


“By working together, the federal and provincial governments are better equipped to respond to the challenge of COVID-19 for this important sector and Canada’s food security. This protocol complements the guidance that the CFIA has provided to federally registered meat establishments to implement measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure for inspectors and workers.”
Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food

In Alberta, facilities already have very strict sanitation protocols and practices. In response to COVID-19, food processors must:

implement measures to prevent the spread of infection, including all recommended mitigation and cleaning requirements and adjustments to their work schedules
continue to implement enhancements to ensure staff and products are safe as they move products into the supply chain

Interested parties may find a copy of the plan here.

While AHS is working to connect PPE to Alberta’s health-care workers, the Provincial Operators Centre is working to connect PPE to non-AHS facilities including, but not limited to, optometrist offices, funeral homes, pharmacies, disability service providers and social service and civil society groups. Non-AHS facilities are encouraged to continue requesting PPE through the government’s one-stop email address at pessecc-logistics@gov.ab.ca.
In addition to regular procurement methods, government is continuing to procure PPE through the Alberta Bits and Pieces Program, which has received about 4,000 offers to date, including 400 specific offers for PPE such as masks, respirators, sanitizer and ventilators. 
Quick facts

AHS, Covenant Health and subsidiary facilities have received more than four million masks.
941 long-term care facilities, designated supportive living facilities, addictions and mental health facilities and home care providers have received more than 1.5 million masks.
Health-care workers such as midwives, pediatricians, gynecologists and obstetricians have received over 1.1 million gloves, over 240,000 masks, over 41,300 gowns and over 44,000 face shields.
The Provincial Operations Centre is working with Service Alberta to distribute 1,500 orders for PPE, including to 1,470 pharmacies through the Alberta Pharmacists’ Association.
About 400 municipal first responder agencies will receive one million masks and one million gloves.
84 long-term care, continuing care and seniors lodges will receive 11,000 canisters of wipes.

The Government of Alberta is spending more than $53 million to implement more online, phone and in-person mental health and addiction recovery support to make it easier for Albertans to access services from anywhere in Alberta during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We know people are struggling right now, and we want Albertans to know that help is there for them through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Alberta’s government is committed to ensuring folks have the support they need to cope and stay mentally healthy during these tough times, which is why our mental health response is the largest in Canada, with funding greater than all other provinces combined.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

The Government of Alberta is investing $21.6 million to improve access to phone and online supports with existing helplines, including the Addiction Helpline, the Mental Health Helpline, the Kids Help Phone and the Community and Social Services Helpline (Alberta 211).
Further spending will contribute to online resources, available to all Albertans, supporting people who may not be able to access face-to-face services, including those in self-isolation or those in rural locations.

“It’s important that Albertans in all corners of the province have access to the mental health and addiction supports they need. These resources will help address the needs of children, youth and adults, and we will continue to work with our partners across the mental health and addiction sector to find innovative ways to support Albertans in need, both now and after the pandemic is behind us.”
Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions

Today’s funding also includes:

$2.6 million to expand individual and group treatment to address family violence, addiction and mental health for Albertans
$4.2 million to expand the addiction and mental health support available through Primary Care Networks
$25 million for a new community grant program to enhance community mental health and addiction recovery for the public, including Indigenous communities, seniors, families and people experiencing social barriers, who are negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 


“The need for mental health supports as a result of this very stressful situation are increasing daily and will continue to do so long after this outbreak has ended. This funding from the Alberta government means we can increase the 211 crisis lines, hire staff so people can reach a live person as well as provide support to those staff who are answering the calls, which can be very stressful in itself. This is vital funding that will make a difference in the lives of so many Albertans.”
Rob Yager, president & CEO, United Way of the Alberta Capital Region


“We are grateful to continue partnering with the Alberta government to support the mental health of all Albertans as they deal with this difficult time. We have been supporting young people for over 30 years, but in partnership with the Government of Alberta, this will be the first time we will be able to leverage our experience to support Albertans of all ages.”
Katherine Hay, president & CEO, Kids Help Phone


“This outstanding announcement highlights the importance of continued recovery and ensures supports are still available for those that need them. Alberta’s response to mental health and addiction recovery is leading the entire country and should be the example for every province going forward.”
Crystal Smalldon, executive director, Canadian Addiction Counsellors Certification Federation

Today’s $53 million in one-time funding is in addition to the previously announced $140 million to create publicly funded addiction recovery spaces for 4,000 more Albertans each year.

Funding to the non-profit organization will help expand support programs and resources for the almost one million Albertans who are caregivers for family and friends, and ensure the many dedicated Albertans caring for their loved ones at home or in the community have access to the supports they need to maintain their well-being. 

“Caregivers are essential to the well-being and quality of life of over one million Albertans. This is particularly true as we deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding to increase supports for caregivers is part of our government’s commitment to ensure that all Albertans are taken care of – during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Caregivers Alberta is the only community organization in Alberta dedicated to the diverse needs of all Alberta caregivers. Funding will help Caregivers Alberta expand supports and increase the reach of these supports so more Albertans can benefit. Supports include:

Developing a public awareness campaign to highlight the importance of caregivers and their work.
Compiling an inventory of caregiver supports across the province.
Expanding the hours of the Caregiver Advisor phone line.
Establishing a referral system to link caregivers and Caregivers Alberta through health-care providers.
Updating and expanding support programs.
Providing employers with resources to support caregivers in the workplace.
Developing a coaching program for caregivers.


“Developing effective caregiver supports so Albertans can age well in their homes and communities is a priority for our government. This funding will make a big difference in the lives of many Albertans and I look forward to seeing the positive impact these additional supports will have on the lives of caregivers and those of their loved ones.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“Without family and friend caregivers, our health-care system would simply collapse – especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding will help support the almost one million caregivers across the province with caregiver-focused programs and services.”
Sandra Sereda, executive director, Caregivers Alberta

Psychosocial, along with other peer and community supports, are currently available through the toll-free caregiver advisor line at 1-877-453-5088 and online at caregiversalberta.ca for all caregivers, including those caring for someone with COVID-19 or in self-isolation. Medical concerns or questions about COVID-19 or how best to care for someone with COVID-19, are best directed to Alberta Health Services’ Health Link at 811. For up-to-date information on COVID-19 and tips on how to reduce your risk, visit Help prevent the spread.
Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

Requests will be quickly processed through the Provincial Operations Centre based on specific need. PPE is being procured through both traditional methods and the Alberta Bits and Pieces Program. This program is helping source equipment and manufacturing opportunities close to home at a time when Albertans need it most.
Quick facts

The Provincial Operations Centre will distribute more than 1,500 orders of PPE in the coming days.
This week, an estimated 400 municipal first responder agencies will receive one million masks and one million pairs of gloves.
More than 1.5 million masks are being distributed to 941 long-term care, designated supportive living, and addiction and mental health facilities.

With farmers in Alberta having gone through one of the toughest harvests in recent memory, the needs of Alberta’s agricultural community have evolved. Service standards and responsiveness have been identified as key improvements for AFSC.

“AFSC will continue to offer business risk management programs and loans to farmers, but the new board’s mandate will be to improve service standards. We want farmers and ranchers to be proud of AFSC.”

Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


AFSC is guided by a board of directors whose knowledge and experience is key to its success. The new board members represent a broad and diverse cross-section of the industry to ensure the best service for Alberta agribusinesses.
These new appointees have been in place since April 12, replacing board members whose terms are expiring. The new appointments reflect government’s commitment to streamline the AFSC to improve its services and responsiveness to farmers.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




In April 1 letters sent to the Natural Resources Conservation Board and the Impact Assessment Agency, the Tsuut’ina Nation stated it has withdrawn its objections to SR1 and will not further participate in the project’s regulatory process.

“The Tsuut’ina Nation is an important partner. We committed to meaningfully consult with impacted communities on the Springbank Reservoir, and the withdrawal of the Nation’s objections demonstrates we are doing just that. This marks a major milestone in the regulatory review of the Springbank Reservoir and we are pleased to continue to work with our First Nations partners.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation


“Our primary concern has always been the protection of our people and our land. We have reached an agreement that provides that protection and allows us to mitigate impacts from flooding in the future. The agreement reached is an example of how our governments can work together.”

Chief Roy Whitney, Tsuut’ina Nation

Alberta Transportation has consulted with First Nations and Indigenous groups on SR1 since August 2014. The department will continue to work with other First Nations and Indigenous groups to address their concerns about the project.
Quick facts

Following the 2013 flood, SR1 has been designed to provide flood protection along the Elbow River in Calgary and other downstream communities.
Once built, SR1 will become part of a flood mitigation system which includes the Glenmore Reservoir, berms at Redwood Meadows and Bragg Creek. 
In July and August 2019, Alberta Transportation responded to a supplemental information request from the federal regulator, including how government was addressing Indigenous concerns.
Future consultation is planned with both community stakeholders and Indigenous groups to address outstanding questions from regulators.

Alberta Parks is also instituting a fire ban in all provincial parks and protected areas.
These early preparedness measures will ensure the province can effectively focus resources where they are needed most in the event of multiple emergencies happening at the same time.
Typically, the wildfire hazard is highest in Alberta in late April through May, when fuel like trees and grasses have extremely low moisture content after the snow has melted.
More than 880,000 hectares burned last year and 71 per cent of wildfires were human-caused and entirely preventable. With provincial resources currently stretched due to COVID-19, these preventative measures will better equip Alberta’s response to spring wildfires this year.
Increased firefighting resources
An additional $5 million investment is being made to hire and train 200 high-quality firefighters to assist with the provincial wildfire suppression this season.
More than 800 seasonal firefighters will join 370 year-round staff at Alberta Wildfire. These resources are hired at one of the 10 Forest Areas, and are moved throughout the Forest Protection Area as required.
Fire ban and OHV restriction
A fire ban in the Forest Protection Area, provincial parks and protected areas, as well as a recreational OHV ban on Crown land in the Forest Protection Area, will come into effect April 15.
Alberta’s Forest Protection Area covers almost 60 per cent of Alberta, most of the northern half of the province and the western border, excluding federal parks.
The government recognizes that many Albertans use OHVs and respects this valid activity. At the same time, the government must take into account limitations and manage risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hot mufflers can potentially start wildfires.
The fire ban and OHV restriction are temporary measures, which will remain in place only as long as required to combat the wildfire risk. Measures may later be adjusted to take into account the needs of specific regions.
All fire permits will be suspended in this area, and landowners are responsible for ensuring any holdover fires are extinguished by this time. 
Indigenous people may use OHVs on public land for traditional purposes. Use of OHVs on private lands, for industrial use (for example forestry, agriculture and energy) and by emergency responders is also permitted.
Higher fines
Fines are being doubled from $300 to $600 for non-compliance with a fire ban and from $600 to $1,200 for non-compliance with an OHV restriction. With 71 per cent of last year’s wildfires started by people, these fine increases reflect the seriousness of the preventative measure Albertans must take to prevent wildfires. 
Individuals found contravening a fire ban or OHV restriction will be subject to increased fines, starting April 15, and could be held liable for all costs associated with fighting a wildfire. Last year, more than $600 million was spent fighting wildfires in Alberta.
These fines are in addition to the existing penalties for arson under the Criminal Code.
Increased FireSmart funding
FireSmart will receive a funding boost of up to $20 million to support vegetation management in the province. The department will work with municipalities to ensure these funds are used this fiscal year.
FireSmart helps to reduce the wildfire risk to Albertans, their homes and communities. The FireSmart program includes grants to support the most at-risk communities in Alberta, including Indigenous communities.
This additional funding will help mitigate wildfire damages and losses in more Alberta communities by creating FireSmart zones around at-risk communities to reduce wildfire hazards.

“Albertans are tough and we’re all doing what we can to keep each other safe during COVID-19. With Alberta’s wildfire season matching with the expected peak of COVID-19, we have to take extra precautions to ensure our response efforts are well-funded and planned out. This spring, we may find ourselves facing multiple disasters at once. With all these measures, we will be prepared.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

Government emergency response
To increase response capacity and prepare for multiple and concurrent disasters, such as wildfires and floods, the Provincial Operations Centre has been reinforced by the creation of a Pandemic Response Planning Team. This team will help coordinate government’s medium and long-term response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Our province is taking steps to prepare for wildfires and other hazards this spring and summer by increasing our emergency response capacity. This means that while we continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will also be ready to respond to other emergencies as they may arise.”
Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs

Quick facts

For more information on wildfires, download the Alberta Wildfire app.
Up-to-date information on fire restrictions, fire bans, OHV restrictions and general wildfire information is available at albertafirebans.ca or by calling 1-866-FYI-FIRE (1-866-394-3473).
To report a wildfire, call 310-FIRE (310-3473) toll-free, from anywhere in Alberta.
Most new seasonal staff will be on-the-ground firefighters, with wages between $22 and $28 per hour.
Fire bans and OHV restrictions have proven to be effective prevention tools in reducing the number of human-caused wildfires.
Anyone found to be non-compliant with a fire ban or OHV restriction may also have to go to court and may receive a fine up to $100,000. Anyone found to be the cause of a wildfire may be liable for the costs associated with extinguishing the fire.
FireSmart is a program that requires cooperation of all people living, working and playing in the forest.

""Happy Vaisakhi to all Albertans who are celebrating this day, particularly in our Sikh community, who celebrate this as Khalsa Day, the birth of the Khalsa, the central tenets of Sikhi, of the Sikh spiritual tradition.
""This is a chance for me to say to all Alberta Sikhs, thank you so much for your works of seva to serve others at this really trying time. I've seen so many beautiful stories about langars producing food to serve to those who are shut in through isolation or people offering many random acts of kindness - that beautiful Sikh tradition of seva.
""So please carry that on, being a light to our broader community at this time especially of Vaisakhi.
""It will be different that people can't go to Gurdwara to offer prayers, we may not even be able to do Nagar Kirtans this year if the public health protocols continue so that we can keep Albertans safe.
""But we can gather in different ways as families and virtually online to extend the best greetings to our neighbours and to our friends.
""So from me to you, to all members of Alberta's dynamic Sikh community:
""Happy Vaisakhi!

The Alberta Hope COVID-19 study will recruit 1,600 Albertans to determine whether a prescribed five-day treatment of HCQ can prevent hospitalization for those at highest risk of developing a severe illness.

“As we’ve learned from other countries, hospital systems can become overwhelmed by those infected with the virus who need critical care. Our goal is to reduce the risk of severe disease experienced by individuals and reduce the burden on the health-care system by helping people recover from the effects of the virus at home.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The clinical trial is being led by University of Calgary and University of Alberta researchers, with support from the Alberta government, Alberta Health Services and its Strategic Clinical Networks, Calgary Health Trust, Alberta Innovates and the University of Calgary/Alberta Health Services Clinical Research Fund.

“Clinical trials like this will give healthcare professionals more evidence to determine how best to care for patients. AHS is rallying alongside its academic partners at the Universities of Calgary and Alberta to help leverage research in the response to this global pandemic.”
Dr. Kathryn Todd, vice-president of Provincial Clinical Excellence, Alberta Health Services

HCQ is originally an anti-malarial drug currently used mostly for immunological disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. Laboratory studies suggest it may be helpful against COVID-19.

“We will be targeting Albertans who are at risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19. Those include people over 18, living independently, who have an underlying medical condition which has proven to contribute to the worsening of symptoms, and eventual hospitalization.”
Dr. Luanne Metz, study lead, and professor at the Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary

Quick facts

The Alberta-specific trial will be funded by a consortium including a $286,000 grant from the Government of Alberta. 
The University of Calgary’s Cumming School of Medicine is a leader in health research, with an international reputation for excellence and innovation in health care research and education.
Alberta Health Services will obtain permission from individuals with positive COVID-19 tests to provide their contact information to Alberta Hope COVID-19 study researchers. Consenting participants will be screened for safety and eligibility.
All Albertans have a responsibility to help prevent the spread. Take steps to protect yourself and others:
	
practise social distancing
stay home and away from others if sick or in mandatory self-isolation
practise good hygiene – wash hands often for at least 20 seconds, cover coughs and sneezes, and avoid touching your face
monitor for symptoms, such as cough, fever, fatigue or difficulty breathing


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.

Starting April 15, the Alberta government will match donations up to $2 million to Alberta-based charities and non-profit organizations with COVID-19 fundraising campaigns. Organizations will be waiving any administration fees associated with campaign donations.

“Alberta’s charities and non-profits and the gift of those who donate is an integral part of what makes us Albertan. These incredible organizations are struggling to fill gaps created by the increased and changing demand for services created by the COVID-19 pandemic. By matching donations, we will amplify the generosity of Albertans and boost the capacity of community organizations working tirelessly to make sure vulnerable Albertans are cared for during the pandemic.”

Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women



“Albertans have always been very generous in times of crisis. Our province has been hit hard by the pandemic, and we are once again calling on Albertans to donate what their finances allow. Every donation will help in some way so charities can continue to feed the hungry, care for seniors, support children and battle homelessness amid COVID-19.”

Jeremy Nixon, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Community and Social Services


Several organizations have already established COVID-19 fundraising campaigns to distribute money quickly to those who need it most. Albertans who donate to these designated organizations by May 31 will have their donations matched by the province. Organizations include:

United Way of the Capital Region – Local Love in a Global Crisis Campaign
United Way Calgary and Area – COVID-19 Community Response Fund
Calgary Foundation – COVID-19 Pandemic Recovery Program
Edmonton Community Foundation – COVID Rapid Response Fund
Community Foundation of Southeastern Alberta – COVID Response for Southeast Alberta
Community Foundation of Lethbridge and Southwestern Alberta – COVID Response and Recovery Grants Program
Community Foundation of Northwestern Alberta – Better Together COVID-19 Response Fund/Community Kitchen and Food Bank Fund

COVID-19 pandemic response programs play a supporting role to flow donations through to local community-based non-profits and charitable organizations that deliver services to Albertans who need it most. Donations will help feed the hungry, care for seniors, support at-risk children, and keep Albertans employed.

Alberta can safely send N95 masks, procedural masks, gloves, goggles and ventilators to these provinces, while maintaining supply for Alberta’s health care system.

“Albertans should be very proud that we are able to extend a helping hand to our Canadian brothers and sisters in this time of need. It is because of Albertans’ efforts to isolate and the incredible job being done by frontline health-care workers that we are in a position to support others during this crisis. We want all of our country to know that in both good times and bad, Alberta is there for Canada.”
Jason Kenney, Premier of Alberta

In Canada, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia are the provinces that have been most impacted by COVID-19. Quebec currently has more than 11,670 cases and 241 deaths, Ontario has more than 6,640 cases and 253 deaths, and British Columbia has more than 1,400 cases and 55 deaths.
Ontario will receive:

250,000 N95 masks
2.5 million procedural masks
15 million gloves
87,000 goggles
50 ventilators

Quebec will receive:

250,000 N95 masks
2 million procedural masks
15 million gloves

British Columbia will receive:

250,000 N95 masks

Alberta will begin shipping these items next week, and is willing to provide more supplies to other provinces as the need arises and as supplies arrive in our province.
Recent COVID-19 modeling projections indicate the most probable scenario for Alberta is the virus will reach its peak mid-May. An estimated 820 people could require hospitalization during the peak period, with more than a quarter requiring critical care. Based on that modeling, with current supply stockpiles and more shipments on the way, Alberta will retain enough of each of the PPE items to maintain an adequate supply of each.

“Our team of Alberta health experts is very confident in our modelling data and our expected need for PPE and ventilators. I assure all Albertans that we have ample supply. We are in a position both to keep Albertans safe and to help ensure Canadian health care systems from coast to coast are equipped to take on the challenges ahead.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

It is expected the ventilators will remain in Ontario until the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak has passed.
Alberta is currently in the process of doubling its ventilator supply by the end of April to ensure the health care system has the capacity to support provincial response. To find out more about Alberta’s COVID-19 modelling, PPE and ventilator supply, visit alberta.ca/COVID19.
Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

L'Alberta enverra des fournitures en Colombie-Britannique, en Ontario et au Québec pour aider à répondre à une demande importante dans ces provinces en matière d'équipements de protection individuelle (EPI) et de ventilateurs.
L'Alberta peut envoyer, en toute confiance, à ces provinces, des masques N95, des masques de procédures, des gants, des lunettes et des ventilateurs, tout en maintenant l'approvisionnement du système de soins de santé de l'Alberta.

« Les Albertains ont raison d'être très fiers que nous puissions tendre une main à nos frères et sœurs canadiens en ces temps difficiles. C'est grâce aux efforts d'isolement des Albertains et l'incroyable travail accompli par les travailleurs de santé de première ligne que nous sommes en mesure de soutenir les autres pendant cette crise. Nous voulons que tout le pays sache que dans les bons et mauvais temps, l'Alberta est là pour le Canada. »
Jason Kenney, premier ministre de l'Alberta

Au Canada, les provinces qui ont été les plus touchées par COVID-19 sont le Québec, l'Ontario et la Colombie-Britannique. Le Québec compte actuellement plus de 11 670 cas et 241 décès, l'Ontario compte plus de 6 640 cas et 253 décès, et la Colombie-Britannique, plus de 1 400 cas et 55 décès.
L'Ontario recevra :

250 000 masques N95
2,5 millions de masques de procédure
15 millions de gants
87 000 lunettes de protection
50 ventilateurs

Le Québec recevra :

250 000 masques N95
2 millions de masques de procédure
15 millions de gants

La Colombie-Britannique recevra :

250 000 masques N95

L'Alberta commencera à expédier ces articles la semaine prochaine, et est disposée à fournir davantage de fournitures aux autres provinces en fonction des besoins et selon l'arrivée des fournitures dans notre province.
D’après les récentes projections de la modélisation de la COVID-19, le scénario le plus probable est que le virus atteindra son point culminant en Alberta à la mi-mai. On estime que 820 personnes pourraient devoir être hospitalisées pendant la période de pointe, dont plus d'un quart nécessiteront des soins intensifs. D’après cette modélisation, avec les réserves actuelles et les expéditions à recevoir, l'Alberta aura suffisamment d’articles d'EPI pour maintenir un approvisionnement adéquat de chaque article.

« Notre équipe d'experts en santé de l'Alberta est très confiante dans nos données de modélisation et dans nos besoins en matière d'EPI et de ventilateurs. J'assure à tous les Albertains et les Albertaines que nous avons les provisions nécessaires. Nous sommes en mesure d'assurer la sécurité des Albertains et des Albertaines et de contribuer à ce que les systèmes de soins de santé canadiens, d'un océan à l'autre, soient équipés pour relever les défis à venir. »
Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé

On s'attend à ce que les ventilateurs restent en Ontario jusqu'à ce que le point culminant de l'épidémie de COVID-19 soit passé.
L'Alberta est actuellement en train de doubler nombre de ventilateurs d'ici la fin avril afin d'assurer que le système de soins de santé a la capacité de soutenir les besoins dans la province. Pour en savoir plus sur la modélisation COVID-19 de l'Alberta, les EPI et l'approvisionnement en ventilateurs, visitez alberta.ca/COVID19 (disponible en anglais).
L'Alberta a mis en place une réponse globale à la COVID-19, y compris des mesures visant à améliorer la distanciation sociale, le dépistage et les tests. Des soutiens financiers aidant les familles et les entreprises de l'Alberta.

“Yesterday Alberta participated in a video meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
“We are cautiously pleased to see that OPEC+ has agreed to reduce production by 10 million barrels per day.
“During the past weeks, we have met with energy workers and employers who have been the hardest hit during this crisis. We will always stand up for Alberta’s energy workers, whether at OPEC+ or in the face of those who wish to see our industry collapse.
“Reliable energy is the lifeblood of any modern economy, and Alberta is home to the third largest oil reserves in the world. Our energy sector represents almost one-tenth of Canada’s gross domestic product and supports over 500,000 jobs across the country.
“The decision to surge supply in the face of the collapse of energy demand triggered by COVID-19 has endangered jobs throughout Alberta and Canada, while forcing North American storage to near capacity.
“The agreement to implement production limits by OPEC+ brings global energy producers in line with measures that Alberta has reluctantly taken since January 2019.
“For our part, we have already seen Alberta producers voluntarily lower their production and cut their capital spending due to decreased demand because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“However, demand will return as economies around the globe recover from this pandemic. Life will return to normal. In the interim, we hope that the measures taken by OPEC+ will stabilize the global price of oil and prevent further stress to energy workers in Alberta.
“Albertans are resilient. Our energy sector has seen high and lows in the past and it has prevailed.
“We will continue to take every action necessary to ensure that the sector is in the best possible position for recovery.”

Updates to continuing care facility rules
As continuing care facilities are most at risk of experiencing serious effects from COVID-19, more stringent measures are being taken to protect residents and staff.
To further protect residents and staff from exposure to COVID-19 through asymptomatic individuals, continuing care workers will now be required to wear masks at all times when providing direct patient care or working in patient care areas.
Workers in long term care and supportive living sites will only be allowed to work at one site in an effort to reduce the spread between locations. These measures will take effect next week.
To protect and provide flexibility for both workers and employers as measures are implemented, the Minister of Labour and Immigration signed a Ministerial Order today. The Government of Alberta is considering financial supports for health care aids and facility operators to minimize the impacts of this change. Details will be communicated to providers and employees in the coming days.
Fact sheet for kids now available
Many parents and caregivers are getting questions from young people in their lives. To help respond, a new fact sheet is available online at Alberta.ca/COVID19. It is aimed at kids and their families and is meant to spur open, honest conversations with kids about coronavirus and the measures being taken to prevent the spread.
Temporary changes to legislation and regulations (Service Alberta)
Service Alberta is making temporary changes to several acts and regulations to help businesses, public bodies and non-profits remain compliant as they focus their efforts on responding to COVID-19.

During this time of urgent need for community supports, there is a strong demand placed on food banks and charitable organizations providing access to food. In an effort to protect vulnerable Albertans, government is providing $5 million to support food banks and community organizations in their food supply efforts.

“Access to food during this pandemic is a critical issue. Vulnerable populations should not be wondering where their next meal will come from. We are allocating this funding to support people so they can access food through food banks and community organizations as we continue to address the impacts of COVID-19.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“As we navigate through this crisis we must work together to support Albertans in need. We are focused on making food and shelter supports readily available and will continue to ensure our most vulnerable and at-risk people have secure access to food throughout this pandemic.”
Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services


“I would like to assure Albertans that we have food security here in Alberta. I would also like to thank all of the organizations across the province that continue to support our food banks. Great initiatives, like 4-H’s charity animal sales, are innovative approaches to promote local charities including food bank donations. I know, through 4-H this year, I will be donating to my local food bank.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

Government will be working with Alberta’s food banks to provide food to vulnerable populations during this pandemic. The funding will directly support Alberta food bank locations, charities, not-for-profits and civil society organizations with their food supply efforts.
Quick facts

On April 3, the Government of Canada announced an investment of $100 million to improve access to food for vulnerable Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Starting tonight, Christians around the world celebrate the holiest days of the year for their ancient Faith.
“On Holy Thursday, the commemoration of the Last Supper recalls the Jewish roots of the Christian Faith, specifically the Passover Seder. The institution of the Eucharist is a central part of the spiritual lives of Catholics, Orthodox and other Christians.
“Good Friday commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the redemptive sacrifice around which the Christian Faith revolves. As St. John Paul II said, ‘The Cross contains the mystery of salvation, because in the Cross, love is lifted up.’
“Finally, Easter Sunday is the culmination of hope for Christians who celebrate the Resurrection, and with it Christ’s victory over death. In the words of the great Byzantine Easter troparion:
‘Christ is risen from the dead,
Trampling down death by death,
And upon those in the tombs
Bestowing life!’
“I wish all Christians celebrating a blessed Easter. While churches will not be able to gather physically this year, the profound spiritual meaning of the Paschal events will nevertheless renew a sense of hope for many Albertans at a time when hope is much needed.
“Happy Easter!”

Latest updates

Expanded access to testing has begun to better trace the spread of COVID-19 in hard-hit areas and in vulnerable residents.
Albertans are strongly encouraged to stay home and in the province this long weekend.
Cases have been identified in all zones across the province:
	
878 cases in the Calgary zone
376 cases in the Edmonton zone
97 cases in the North zone
72 cases in the Central zone
26 cases in the South zone
Two cases in zones yet to be confirmed


Of these cases, there are currently 47 people in hospital, 14 of whom have been admitted to intensive care units (ICU).
192 cases are suspected of being community acquired.
There are now a total of 592 confirmed recovered cases.
Two new deaths are from the Calgary zone, bringing the total in this zone to 22. One additional person has died in the Edmonton zone, bringing the number of deaths to five in this zone. Four people have died in the North zone, and one person has died in the Central zone.
Stronger outbreak measures have been put in place at continuing care facilities. To date, 151 cases have been confirmed at these facilities.
There have been 68,116 people tested for COVID-19 and a total of 70,247 tests performed by the lab. There were 1,333 people tested in the last 24 hours.
Aggregate data, showing cases by age range and zone, as well as by local geographic areas, is available online at alberta.ca/covid19statistics.
All Albertans need to work together to help prevent the spread and overcome COVID-19.
Restrictions remain in place for all gatherings and close-contact businesses, dine-in restaurants and non-essential retail services. A full list of restrictions is available online.
Tighter restrictions have been placed on visitors to continuing care centres, group homes and other facilities. No visitors will be allowed unless a resident is dying or the visitor is essential for delivering care that cannot be delivered by staff.
As Albertans look forward to the holiday weekend, they are being reminded to:
	
avoid gatherings outside of their immediate household
visit over coffee remotely and virtually
try to shop for groceries outside of peak hours
limit Easter egg hunts to inside or on their property
find ways to connect while being physically separated
worship in a way that does not put people at risk, including participating in virtual or live-streamed religious celebrations



More guidelines for faith-based organizations can be found online.
Expanding testing to meet needs of Albertans
Alberta is expanding access to COVID-19 laboratory tests to better trace the spread of the novel coronavirus in hard-hit areas and in vulnerable residents. Testing is now being offered to three additional groups of individuals exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 including cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat or shortness of breath:

symptomatic people living in the Calgary Zone
symptomatic people who live with someone aged 65 years or older
essential workers whose workplaces remain accessible to the public

Read the full list of people eligible for testing here. People can access tests by completing the COVID-19 self-assessment online.
The chief medical officer of health will examine and adjust testing protocols and access to COVID-19 tests based on the changing situation in Alberta.
Stay home and in Alberta this long weekend
Albertans are being strongly encouraged to stay home, in their communities, in the province and off the highways this long weekend to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
Alberta and British Columbia have released a joint statement asking families and friends to stay in their home provinces and celebrate the holidays virtually. This will reduce the risk of highway crashes – tying up emergency and medical responders who are busy with pandemic planning and care – and help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus between families and provinces.
COVID-19 health care for out-of-country visitors
To limit the potential spread of the novel coronavirus, individuals visiting Alberta from another country will receive physician and hospital services for the treatment of COVID-19 – even if they do not have health coverage or the ability to pay. This temporary measure will protect Albertans and encourage visitors to obtain treatment for COVID-19. Physicians may submit claims for this service using the new COVID-19 billing process. More information about the billing process will be provided to physicians.
Alberta Connects Contact Centre
The Alberta Connects Contact Centre continues to operate over the long weekend, and will be available to Albertans from 8:15 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., April 10-13. Direct lines to specific services (such as MyAlberta Digital Identity) will be closed. Albertans should call 310-4455 for assistance.
Access to justice
The Alberta Court of Appeal has provided an update regarding electronic hearings. More information: https://albertacourts.ca/ca/publications/announcements  
Mental health supports
Confidential supports are available to help with mental health concerns. The Mental Health Help Line 1-877-303-2642 and the Addiction Help Line at 1-866-332-2322 are available between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., seven days a week. Online resources provide advice on handling stressful situations or ways to talk with children.
Family violence prevention
A 24-hour Family Violence Information Line is available at 310-1818 to get anonymous help.
Alberta’s One Line for Sexual Violence is available at 1-866-402-8000 from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in more than 170 languages.
Information sheets and other resources on family violence prevention are available at alberta.ca/COVID19.
Quick facts

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.

Keeping Alberta’s food supply chain safe and intact is a priority. The new Agriculture Jobs Connector website is a tool for Albertans to find essential agriculture work opportunities and for essential agriculture businesses to find workers.
Currently, some farms in Alberta rely on a federal temporary foreign workers (TFW) program to hire seasonal workers. However, with travel restrictions, typical users of this program are concerned about the availability of foreign workers.
With so many Albertans now out of work due to no fault of their own from COVID-19, there is an opportunity for the needs of both employers in the agriculture sector and Albertans wanting work to connect.

“There are great job opportunities on Alberta farms and ranches. There is definitely a greater appreciation for Alberta’s agriculture sector, and this new website will help Albertans find an exciting new job in this essential service.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

Agriculture and food employers and workers can access hiring, job search and farm safety resources through the new Agriculture Job Connector at alberta.ca/AgJobConnector.
Agriculture employers are encouraged to post available jobs on the connector so the positions can be filled by hard-working Albertans who will help keep the food supply chain operational.
In the U.K., due to COVID-19, thousands of seasonal foreign workers were no longer available and a “land army” of thousands of British people came out to work on farms. This website will help connect an Albertan “land army” of non-traditional agriculture workers enter a new and important labour market.

Alberta-based Sprung Structures has donated a temporary structure to Alberta Health Services (AHS) that will add up to 6,000 square feet of treatment space. This will create about 100 more care spaces for Calgary-area patients.
The value of the donation from Sprung Structures is $235,000.
There have been 835 cases of COVID-19 identified in the Calgary zone as of April 8. This represents 61 per cent of all the cases in Alberta.

“Our health system is working around-the-clock to respond to COVID-19. This donation to AHS and the people of Alberta will significantly expand capacity and, ultimately, help save lives. I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Sprung Structures on behalf of all Albertans.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“This donation will greatly assist AHS with our planning and increase our capacity as we address the COVID-19 pandemic. This new space will provide more options for treatment beyond the scope of our existing facilities as our teams continue to care for Albertans and battle this pandemic. On behalf of AHS, I’d like to say how appreciative we all are for the generosity of Phil and Tim Sprung, and would like to extend our gratitude to Sprung Structures.”
Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO, Alberta Health Services


“When the province needs help in a time of crisis, we want to step up and do our part. We hope the donation of this structure will help ease capacity pressures on the health-care system and give our province's health-care providers the space they need to care for Albertans during this global pandemic.”
Tim Sprung, vice-president, Sprung Structures

Planning and implementation teams from the Alberta government, AHS, and local officials are working with Sprung Structures and its partners to fast-track this initiative. The structure will be located in the parking lot next to the Peter Lougheed Centre.
AHS will invest up to $3 million to turn the structure into a site for safe, high-quality health-care delivery that meets all standards for infection prevention and control.
Quick facts

The Sprung structure is 70 metres by 105 metres and will add up to 557 square metres (6,000 square feet) of treatment space, which will also include room for staff and physician support space and patient washrooms.
The structure is a tensioned membrane building solution combining an aluminum substructure with highly tensioned membrane panels.
Family-owned and operated since 1887, the Sprung Group of Companies has been manufacturing innovative building solutions for 133 years. Sprung has more than 12,000 structures in 100 countries around the world.
AHS is working on other measures to increase the number of acute care beds in the Calgary zone and throughout the province in response to a surge of demand caused by COVID-19. These measures include postponement of all elective surgeries and procedures, and identifying non-clinical spaces in AHS facilities that can be adapted for patient care.
In all, AHS is ensuring that more than 3,000 acute care and intensive care spaces are available for patients with COVID-19.

Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




In the days leading up to the incident, EPS had identified the man as the individual responsible for a series of armed, violent offences, and officers were actively searching for him in order to execute a number of outstanding arrest warrants.
On Oct. 20, EPS received a 911 call from an individual who had just observed a break-in to a neighbouring house in west Edmonton. The caller provided a description of the individual, and indicated that he had gained access to the residence by breaking a window. Several minutes later, EPS received a second 911 call from the man inside the residence, indicating he was the individual police were looking for, warning police to back off, and indicating that he had a person inside the residence with him. The man hung up, but placed additional 911 calls delivering a similar warning.
The EPS Tactical Unit was dispatched to the location and a negotiator began a dialogue with the man, ultimately determining that he was alone inside the residence and in possession of a shotgun. The man was instructed not to exit the residence with the shotgun, as this would be perceived as a lethal threat. The man indicated he understood. As negotiations continued, EPS observed the man removing a screen from a window on the upper floor of the residence, and placing a doll in the window. The doll fell out of the window, and was replaced with a second doll. Shortly after the second doll was placed in the window, the man, using the shotgun, shot the doll, which fell to the ground below. Despite the discharge of a firearm, negotiations with the man continued.
Without warning, the man emerged from the residence and began to walk towards the driveway of the neighbouring residence while carrying a shotgun in his right hand. The Tactical Unit’s armoured vehicle was repositioned on the driveway, and an officer inside the vehicle used the loudspeaker to order the man to drop the firearm. The man ignored these commands, and continued to hold the firearm with his finger on the trigger, while behaving in a manner that witnesses described as aggressive, unpredictable, and confrontational. The man yelled back at the armoured vehicle, indicating that he would not drop the firearm.
Several officers located outside of the vehicle proceeded to use non-lethal options to separate the man from the shotgun. Several flash-bang devices were deployed. At the same time, another member of the Tactical Unit fired on the man using an ARWEN less-lethal launcher.
When the man was struck by the first ARWEN round, he turned and the shotgun began to rise as he fell to the ground. Seeing that the man was still in a position to fire the shotgun, when the barrel of the man’s shotgun came level with officers, two officers fired a total of three shots from carbine rifles. One of these shots struck the man, who fell to the ground, dropping the gun.
Once the man was on the ground, officers secured his shotgun and removed a replica handgun from his belt. The Tactical Emergency Medical Services (TEMS) paramedic immediately treated the man, who was ultimately taken to hospital and treated for a superficial gunshot wound, which was closed with stiches and did not require surgery.
During the man’s transport to hospital, and upon arrival, the man made a number of comments suggesting that he had intended to cause police to shoot him as a means of ending his life. While the officers and the paramedic dealing with the man after the incident did not perceive him to be grossly intoxicated, the man admitted to having used methamphetamine in the days leading up to the incident.
The firearm recovered from the man was a loaded, pump-action 12-gauge shotgun, which had been sawed-off, and had the serial number defaced. After the incident, it was discovered that prior to emerging from the residence, the man had made comments on social media seemingly suggesting his own impending death.
Under the Criminal Code, a police officer is authorized to use as much force as is reasonably necessary to carry out their duties. In circumstances where an officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that force is necessary to protect themselves or others from death or grievous bodily harm, the force an officer is entitled to use can include potentially lethal force.
In these circumstances, the man’s unexpected exit from the residence where he had barricaded himself, while holding a firearm that he had previously demonstrated he was willing to use, created a situation of significant and immediate risk. Despite this risk, the officers initially attempted to address the threat through non-lethal means. When the barrel of the man’s firearm rose during the encounter, it created a danger that exposed several police officers to a risk of imminent death or grievous bodily harm. The risk was objectively serious and immediate, and while the man’s intentions are unknown, as he declined to provide a voluntary statement, the dangers presented by pointing a loaded firearm are indisputable.
Faced with this danger, both officers were lawfully entitled to act in defence of themselves and the other officers on scene.
In considering all of the circumstances of this matter, it is the opinion of executive director Susan Hughson, Q.C., that the evidence does not provide reasonable grounds, nor even reasonable suspicion, to believe that any officers committed an offence.
While it is unfortunate that the man sustained an injury during his arrest, his actions in rapidly exiting the residence while armed created a situation of significant potential risk. The EPS Tactical Unit exercised restraint, initially turned to other intervention methods before being placed in a position where the use of lethal force became necessary. As that situation unfolded, it presented the involved officers with a reasonable apprehension that their own and other lives were endangered. The force that was used to address that danger was reasonable given all of the circumstances.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

Regulation changes will temporarily allow commercial truck drivers transporting essential supplies in direct support of the COVlD-19 relief efforts to:

Work for longer periods of time, provided all safety conditions are met.
Apply for fewer municipal and provincial overweight permits by increasing the limits on weight of loads some vehicles can carry.
Be exempt from road bans.
Be exempt from municipal bylaws that restrict the hours they operate and park.

These temporary adjustments are being offered as part of pandemic response efforts, provided all safety conditions are being met.
The regulation changes also allow provincially regulated railways to temporarily delay audits and retesting of existing operators’ skills and medical fitness, to ensure physical distancing requirements can be met.

“These temporary changes are necessary to ensure the critical movement of essential supplies as part of the COVID-19 response. It is important that we keep the supply chain open and moving, so that Albertans can access the supplies they need, including groceries, medical supplies and fuel, during the pandemic.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation

Certain regulations are also being temporarily modified to allow Albertans to practise physical distancing:

Albertans and businesses will have until 30 days after the public health emergency ends to file appeals to the Alberta Transportation Safety Board and 30 days after the ministerial order ends to file judicial reviews of the board’s decisions.
The expiry dates of vehicle inspection certificates and decals will be extended to May 15 for those certificates set to expire between March 17 and May 15.
Government is extending the timeline for most drivers who require a medical evaluation to provide their completed medical form when applying for or renewing their licence.

Quick facts

Unless another deadline is specified, these temporary changes will remain in effect until the ministerial orders end. The ministerial orders will end on whichever date is earliest:
	
August 14 or 60 days after the public health emergency order ends, if it ends before June 15.
Another date determined by the minister or cabinet.


The expiry date for the following inspection certificates has been extended until May 15, if the certificate was set to expire between March 17 and May 15:
	
Commercial Vehicle Inspection certificates and decals
Out of Province Motor Vehicle Inspection certificates
Salvage Motor Vehicle Inspection certificates


The deadline to file appeals to the Alberta Transportation Safety Board is 30 days after the public health emergency ends. The deadline to apply to the courts for judicial review of the board’s decisions is now 30 days after the ministerial order ends.

Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The government is doubling the capital maintenance and renewal (CMR) funding in 2020-21 from $937 million to $1.9 billion by accelerating the capital plan. This will allow government to act quickly and work with companies across the province so they can keep their workers employed during these challenging times.

“These infrastructure investments will be focused on projects that can be actioned quickly. By doubling our capital maintenance and renewal project funds, we will deliver much-needed improvements to important assets, keep companies operating and most importantly, keep Albertans working. As the weather improves and buildings are empty, now is the perfect time for us to act.” 
Jason Kenney, Premier

A long-term capital maintenance and renewal strategy ensures capital assets are sustained and repaired to generate the most value. These assets include schools, roads, post-secondary institutions, justice facilities and more.
By accelerating the capital plan, significant additional work will be undertaken, including $410 million for transportation projects. This includes an additional $60 million for operating, which covers work repairing potholes across the province.

“Investing in road construction and maintenance represents excellent value for taxpayers. This significant contribution will create thousands of jobs and economic benefits to communities across Alberta. On behalf of our 800 member companies, the ARHCA thanks the Alberta government for this substantial investment.”
 Ron Glen, CEO, Alberta Roadbuilders and Heavy Construction Association

Quick facts

Budget 2020 included $6.9 billion for capital in 2020-21 and $19.3 billion over the three-year fiscal plan
For 2020-21, this represented an increase of $1.2 billion or 21 per cent compared with Budget 2019 
	
CMR funding was budgeted at $937 million in 2020-21 and is now expected to grow to $1.9 billion


114 projects are currently in planning and design
There are 95 projects currently in construction including 27 schools and nine major bridge and road projects – not including capital maintenance and repair

“On the morning of April 9, 1917, on a battlefield in France, a deafening artillery barrage began. Advancing steadily behind this unprecedented wave of destruction were all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, brought together for the first time in the war.
“Their number included men from across the nation, of every background. They included immigrants, who had known the sting of intolerance in their new homeland. They included Canadians of Asian heritage, treated as outsiders in the land of their birth, and Indigenous troops, whose rights were scarcely recognized by the nation whose name was emblazoned on their uniforms. They all fought for Canada.
“By the end of the day, they had reached the heights of Vimy Ridge, an enemy stronghold that other armies had tried, and failed, to capture. The victory cost Canada dearly: 3,598 lives lost, and more than 7,000 wounded.
“And yet, Vimy Ridge marked a bright spot in the grim chronicle of war. Through state-of-the-art planning and training techniques, Canadians together achieved what others could not. Their victory declared that Canada could stand on its own.
“As we recall the triumph at Vimy Ridge, let us not forget that the soaring marble monument that stands there today is dedicated to 11,285 Canadians who died during the four long years of the First World War, and who have no known grave.
“Let us remember them today, and work for peace every day.”

Modelling the extent of COVID-19 in Alberta
The province released two different scenarios or forecasts estimating the trajectory of COVID-19 in Alberta and the impacts on the health system. Preparing for multiple scenarios – including the probable trajectory and an elevated trajectory – help ensure the right resources and supports are in place to help Albertans. This includes sufficient hospital and intensive care unit beds, ventilators and protective personal equipment for Albertans and the health-care workers caring for them. Full details of the modelling are available here.
Regulatory reporting deferrals
The Government of Alberta is immediately deferring specific legislated reporting requirements for energy companies under the Coal Conservation Act, the Oil and Gas Conservation Act and the Oil Sands Conservation Act.
These deferrals will not affect any monitoring requirements that ensure Alberta’s public safety and environmental protection, or any reporting required for royalty calculation and collection.
The order will expire on August 14, or 60 days after the date on which the public health emergency ends, whichever is earlier.
Quick facts

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.

ASIRT’s investigation was comprehensive and thorough, using current best investigative practices. ASIRT interviewed all relevant police and civilian witnesses, including the involved officers who provided voluntary statements. The available evidence also included significant high-quality security video from a nearby rural residence and in-car video from the three RCMP vehicles on the scene.
At about 7:40 a.m. that day, RCMP received a complaint that a heavy-duty Ford 250 truck had been stolen from the Keyera Nevis Gas Plant. Shortly thereafter, RCMP received a report of a suspicious vehicle parked on Range Road 235, south of Highway 11. The description of the vehicle, including the licence plate, matched the description of the vehicle that had been reported stolen.
At about 9:21 a.m., three officers in full uniform and in marked police vehicles arrived on scene to find the stolen vehicle parked, with a man who appeared to be asleep in the driver’s seat.
The three officers made a plan to arrest the man that involved placing a spike belt under the vehicle and arranging their vehicles to block the truck. A quick look inside the vehicle revealed what appeared to be a used syringe on the console. One of the officers opened the driver’s door, touched the man, and told him he was under arrest. The man stirred just as the officer grabbed his hand to apply handcuffs. The man resisted. He was again told that he was under arrest and ordered not to move. The man tried to get the Ford in gear. When the officer dealing with the man tried to reach in and grab the keys to turn off the Ford, he found there were no keys in the ignition. The man reached for the gearshift and a physical struggle ensued.
Because the man was wearing his seatbelt, the officer was unable to pull him from the vehicle. The officers heard the engine revving as the man suddenly put the vehicle into reverse. While two of the officers were able to jump out of harm’s way, the other officer was caught between the vehicle and the open driver’s door and began being dragged by the vehicle. The Ford backed up rapidly and reversed hard into the marked RCMP vehicle that had been parked behind it. The Ford continued to accelerate and push the RCMP vehicle in reverse, while the speed and force of the Ford and the position of the driver’s door trapped the officer in place. The officer believed he was going to fall or get pulled underneath the truck and be seriously injured or killed.
All three officers were yelling for the man to stop the vehicle, which he failed to do. The trapped officer tried to jump away from the vehicle but continued to be pinned by the door. As the Ford reversed, the officer who had been in front of the vehicle was unable to see his colleague’s upper body. Fearing for the officer’s life and safety, he fired three rounds from his carbine. At the same time, the trapped officer pushed himself away from door of the Ford and fortunately fell far enough away to avoid being caught underneath the undercarriage and wheels of the quickly moving heavy-duty truck. The third officer also fired a round from his service pistol.
The man sustained a head injury. The truck, however, continued in reverse and drove the RCMP vehicle into the ditch with such force that the RCMP vehicle rolled. The stolen vehicle continued to travel down the ditch, crashing through a farmer’s cattle gate before eventually stopping.
All officers ran to the vehicle, where they discovered the engine was running and the man’s foot was still on the accelerator. The man had a critical head injury but was still alive. Officers attempted to care for the man until Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived and the man was ultimately transported by STARS to an Edmonton hospital where he was pronounced dead. On autopsy, cause of death was confirmed to be the gunshot wound to the head. Toxicology reports revealed the presence of methamphetamine in the man’s body.
Under the Criminal Code, police officers are granted certain powers to carry out the performance of what can be a challenging job. A police officer is authorized under the Criminal Code to use as much force as is reasonably necessary in administration or enforcement of the law. This can, in limited circumstances, include force that is intended or likely to cause grievous bodily harm or death. Resort to lethal force is only authorized in circumstances when an officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of anyone under the person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm. Further, under the Criminal Code, any person, including a police officer, is entitled to use reasonable force in defence of themselves or another person.
Upon careful review of the evidence gathered in this matter, it is the opinion of executive director Susan Hughson, Q.C., that the evidence does not provide reasonable grounds to believe that any officers committed any offences.
In this particular case, all three officers were on duty and actively engaged in the lawful execution of their duties. The officers were dressed in full uniform and were each operating fully marked police vehicles. As such, all officers were readily identifiable as police officers. The officers were acting in the scope of their duties when they approached the man in the parked stolen vehicle to deal with him and arrest him.
Any assessment of the reasonableness of force used requires consideration of a number of different factors, including the use or threatened use of a weapon, the imminence of the threat, other options available, and the nature of the force or threat of force itself. In this case, the man failed to comply with repeated clear verbal commands and persisted in his attempts to put the vehicle in motion. This case differs from others in that the man’s decision to put his vehicle into motion immediately placed an officer at actual risk of grievous bodily harm or death. The man’s conduct, trapping and dragging the officer between the door and the body of the moving vehicle, made the heavy-duty vehicle a weapon very capable of potentially causing that officer’s death.
Under the circumstances, and viewing the incident as a whole, the officers’ use of lethal force – employed only after the man failed to comply with commands and escalated the situation by putting the vehicle in motion and dragging the officer – was reasonable. The risk presented by these actions was both serious and immediate. These actions, both objectively and subjectively, gave rise to a risk of grievous bodily harm or death to the officer, and accordingly, the decision by officers to fire their service weapons, albeit a last resort, was both lawful and justified. ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

Alberta Health’s modelling projections indicate total cases range from 800,000 to one million infections, from mild and undiagnosed to detected, confirmed and treated, under two provincial scenarios. The Government of Alberta is advising that existing public health orders could be in place until the end of May to protect the health and safety of Albertans.

“I know these numbers can be overwhelming. But these models are not a done deal. I want Albertans to see them as a challenge. Perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation. The modelling helps us anticipate and prepare for the demands on Alberta’s health-care system so we can ensure we are prepared to support patients at the peak of the pandemic and beyond.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Both scenarios estimate that after the virus reaches its peak, the number of cases will decline over the summer months. Without any provincial interventions to manage the pandemic response, projections show that about 13,000 Albertans could have been hospitalized with 3,900 requiring intensive care.

“COVID-19 presents an unprecedented challenge to our healthcare system. Our government has taken and continues to take aggressive measures to make sure the health-care system is ready”.
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The modelling helps us anticipate and prepare for the demands on Alberta’s health-care system. Alberta Health has been scaling up the capacity of the province’s health care system by expanding the capacity of hospitals, opening up more acute care beds, intensive care unit spaces, and ventilators. These measures will ensure that under both provincial scenarios, our health-care system is prepared to support patients at the peak of the pandemic.

 “We are actively increasing capacity in Alberta Health Services facilities by postponing non-urgent surgeries and diagnostic imaging, reducing a number of non-emergency services offered in hospitals, relocating patients to continuing care spaces where possible, and enhancing the use of videoconferencing and telephone care to connect physicians and health professionals with patients remotely. With these measures, and because of the hard work of our front-line health-care workers – our nurses, doctors and those who support them – we are well-positioned to manage the probable impacts of COVID-19 in the coming months.”
Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO, Alberta Health Services

Quick facts

The model uses several key assumptions, including:
	
not all cases are detected
transmission is more common within an age group, rather than between age groups
there is no asymptomatic transmission
people are infectious for five to 10 days
all ICU patients require ventilation
overall 14 per cent of cases are hospitalized and 5 per cent require ICU, but this varies significantly by age


All Albertans have a responsibility to help prevent the spread. Take steps to protect yourself and others:
	
Practise social distancing.
Stay home and away from others if sick or in mandatory self-isolation.
Practise good hygiene – wash hands often for at least 20 seconds, cover coughs and sneezes, and avoid touching your face.
Monitor for symptoms, such as cough, fever, fatigue or difficulty breathing.

“Albertans of Jewish faith are celebrating Passover, commemorating the enslavement, fight against oppression and eventual emancipation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is limiting the size of the gatherings, but families are still finding ways to feast, share in thousand-year-old rituals, and retell stories of that long-ago Exodus. It was the first of many triumphs over adversity in the long arc of Jewish history. From ancient times to the 20th century, the Jewish story has been one of struggle and, more importantly, of liberation.
“May Passover remind us all of the freedom we enjoy as Albertans, which binds us together whatever our differences. And may the inspiring story of Exodus encourage us as we preserve that freedom – of faith, of thought, and of enterprise.
“I wish all who celebrate a happy Passover. Chag Pesach Sameach!”

Latest updates

While there are only 25 new reported cases, it is important to not place too much emphasis or predict trends on any given day’s figures. Low cases are likely partially a delayed result of the testing changes implemented on March 23. Despite aggressive measures, cases are expected to continue to rise.
Tighter restrictions have been placed on visitors to continuing care centres, group homes and other facilities.
A total of 967 cases are laboratory confirmed and 406 are probable cases (symptomatic close contacts of laboratory confirmed cases). Laboratory positivity rates remain consistent at two per cent.
Cases have been identified in all zones across the province:

At about 6 a.m., Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to a location in southwest Calgary to assist a man who was believed to be experiencing a mental health issue. The man was located in front of his residence and was non-compliant with EMS upon their arrival. A second EMS unit, as well as CPS assistance, was requested. While the man was being escorted to the ambulance, an incident occurred during which the man was placed in handcuffs. Once handcuffed, the man was carried to the ambulance by EMS. Inside the ambulance, EMS determined that he had stopped breathing. EMS administered CPR and transported the man to hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
ASIRT investigators are asking anyone who was in the area of the 2400 block of Erlton Road SW at approximately 6 a.m. and witnessed these events to contact ASIRT at 403-592-4306.
With ASIRT’s investigation underway, no further information will be released at this time.

These supports are targeted to families facing poverty or trauma who may need support and guidance to build healthy families and contribute to healthy communities, ultimately reducing the number of children who will come into provincial care. As Alberta faces both a pandemic and an economic contraction due to the oil price drop, support to families in need will be critical.

“Now, more than ever, we need to make sure that children and their families have targeted supports that promote child safety, well-being and development. Our new Family Resource Networks will provide programs, services and supports to build stronger, more resilient families and communities across the province.”
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services

Networks will coordinate the delivery of prevention and early intervention services in all geographic areas and in various cultural communities across the province – either by delivering them directly or collaborating with other qualified service agencies or community partners. This approach allows for a flexible, responsive service model tailored to the unique needs of each community and reflective of the diverse cultural identities in Alberta. It also ensures no area of the province is neglected and that supports are both linked and consistent wherever a family lives or moves to.

“Early childhood development, parent education, and social connections have been cornerstone services for the agency for over 20 years and we are very excited to be able to provide services under the new Family Resource Network model. We look forward to the future!”
Shari-Lynne Gidyk, executive director, Family Futures Resource Network (Edmonton)


“Aspen has been delivering best-in-class community-based services to children, youth and families for many years. We are extremely excited to have been selected as a partner to deliver these supports. We recognize that Alberta’s future rests with the children and youth of today.”
Shirley Purves, chief executive officer, Aspen Family & Community Network Society (Calgary, Chestermere/Strathmore)

Supports and services will specifically focus on strengthening parenting and caregiving knowledge, social support, coping and problem-solving skills, access to other community supports and resources, improving child and youth development, building resiliency and fostering well-being. Examples include in-home visitation, parenting advice and coaching, parent support groups and early childhood development programs focusing on early literacy and play.
Children’s Services was able to continue the expression of interest process remotely to ensure that when the crisis of the pandemic subsides, successful service providers will be fully prepared to welcome families. Until that time, Family Resource Networks will be responsive and adaptable, identifying support services that can be delivered by phone or over the internet. A link to these resources will be provided to assist Albertans to locate services best suited to their needs.
Please visit www.alberta.ca for the most current information on Alberta’s COVID19 response.
Quick facts

In March 2019, Children’s Services released Well-being and Resiliency: A Framework for Supporting Safe and Healthy Children and Families. The framework provides a road map to enhancing, strengthening and promoting a consistent, provincewide approach to prevention and early intervention services and supports for Alberta’s children, youth and families.
In November 2019, the Ministry of Children’s Services invited prevention and early intervention service providers across the province to submit proposals for the delivery of services through a formal expression of interest.
More than 400 proposals were submitted by proponents across Alberta.
Proposals were assessed based on organizational capacity, partnerships and collaboration, service delivery plans, proposed budget and alignment to the Well-Being and Resiliency Framework and the miyo resource – which are based on leading brain science and cultural connection practice.
Realignment of prevention and early intervention contracts and grants into a transformed family resource program model will align with the Government of Alberta’s Well-Being and Resiliency Framework and other resources and, by reducing redundancies and targeting supports, will save $15 million in 2020-21.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Under an amended public health order, no visitors will be allowed unless a resident is dying or the visitor is essential for delivering care that cannot be delivered by staff.
There have been 1,348 cases of COVID-19 identified in the province as of April 6. This includes 112 confirmed cases and 13 deaths at continuing care facilities. 

“Residents of all continuing care sites are at extreme risk if exposed to COVID-19, and we are doing everything possible to ensure their safety. I know this will have a profound impact on the lives of those residents and their families; this is not a step that we take lightly. I’m asking all Albertans to reach out and support their loved ones through the phone, video and any other means possible.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health


“This order is an aggressive but necessary step to help limit the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of vulnerable Albertans. Our government will support any action needed to protect the lives of residents at continuing care facilities across the province.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The new restriction applies to all licensed supportive living, long-term care and other continuing care facilities in the province. It also applies to all residential addiction treatment operators licensed under the Mental Health Services Protection Act.
Family, friends and religious leaders will still be allowed to visit a resident who is dying. In these cases, only one visitor can enter at a time and they cannot interact with any other residents while in the building. Exceptions will also be made if an essential visitor is needed to provide specialized care for a resident.
Any visitor entering these facilities must undergo a health screening prior to stepping inside. This includes a temperature check and a questionnaire. Anyone sick will not be allowed into the building. Those who are well will be required to wear a mask or face covering during the time they are in the building.
This order builds on the restrictions implemented by Alberta Health Services on April 3, ensuring that all facilities in Alberta are following the same strict standards.
All other public health measures remain in place for continuing care facilities. This includes daily screening of staff, enhanced cleaning and other infection prevention control measures, and mandatory outbreak protocols that must be followed for all facilities.

Members will consider several pieces of legislation on issues ranging from municipal emergency preparedness to providing increased support to survivors of human trafficking.

“While government, the public and our enforcement agencies are rightly focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, we must continue our work to enhance protections for vulnerable Albertans – such as survivors of human trafficking. We also want to ensure that mobile home tenants are placed on equal footing with other renters in terms of dispute resolution, to give them added confidence in the stability of their housing status during this difficult time. We are also better supporting municipal operations regarding COVID-19 by making further changes to the Emergency Management Act. ”
Jason Nixon, Government House Leader

Government will be working to ensure that MLAs are doing all they can to adhere to the best practices outlined by the chief medical officer of health while in the chamber. The health and safety of members and all Albertans remains our highest priority.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




If passed, the proposed legislation will extend the definition of sexual exploitation to persons of all ages, make it easier for survivors to get protection orders, enable police to take quicker action to rescue survivors, allow survivors to sue traffickers, and create an awareness day to make Albertans more aware of this important issue.

“Too often, Albertans think that human trafficking is something that happens at the remote corners of the developing world. The truth is it happens in our own communities, and sometimes it happens as close as the business or house next door. That’s why Alberta has to be a leader in this fight.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Survivors rely on a patchwork of existing remedies and statutory protections, and too many fall between the cracks in our system. We are strengthening a survivor’s ability to get away from this physically, emotionally and financially damaging abuse. We are taking action to be a leader in the country’s approach to protecting and empowering survivors.” 
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


“Human trafficking is the reprehensible exploitation of people, mostly young women and children. We must strengthen protections for survivors. We are continuing our commitment to end violence against women and girls and empowering them to take their lives back. We will raise awareness and, by working together, we can support survivors and prevent this horrific act from impacting more people.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women


“Human trafficking is a vile and insidious crime and a significant number of its survivors are under the age of 18. These children and youth have a right to physical and emotional safety, security and well-being. We are committed to standing up for the survivors of human trafficking and helping them find a path to a brighter future.”
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services


“The human trafficking legislation will benefit survivors and hold offenders accountable in these horrific crimes against persons. Prevention, prosecution and protection through partnership is paramount to tackling these issues in Alberta. We look forward to law enforcement agencies, government and non-profit agencies all working together with this new legislation in Alberta.”
Cpl. Kim Bradfield, KARE Counter Exploitation Unit, RCMP


""An awareness day, emergency protection orders and the ability to sue traffickers can help those who have suffered. We work closely with law enforcement and community partners to support those who are in immediate danger from their traffickers, and it is abundantly clear that we need to do more to create much-needed protection at critical stages."" 
Kate Quinn, executive director, CEASE: Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation


“Human trafficking is an extreme human rights violation that impacts some of the most vulnerable people in our province. Because human trafficking remains largely underground, victims are often not identified, and convictions are rare. Addressing human trafficking requires the concerted efforts of all of us, including government, law enforcement and NGOs to prevent this human rights abuse, protect victims and prosecute traffickers.”
Amy Wilson, executive director, Action Coalition on Human Trafficking

As part of a broader provincial strategy, human trafficking legislation fulfils a commitment made during the throne speech in May 2019.
Quick facts 

Human trafficking is a serious crime that exploits people of all ages, ethnicities and genders. It takes three forms: sexual exploitation, forced labour trafficking and trafficking in human organs or tissues.
In 2018, police reported 228 human trafficking incidents in Canada – 12 were in Alberta.
This new legislation would allow government to create:
	
An annual day – Feb. 22 – to bring awareness to the issue of human trafficking.
A standard definition of human trafficking.
A standard definition of sexual exploitation.
A statutory tort allowing victims of trafficking to sue their traffickers.
A statutory remedy allowing victims to secure a protection order from their traffickers.
A warrant permitting a police officer entry.


Alberta’s proposed legislation also has innovations not found in other provinces, such as:
	
adding a warrant permitting entry
allowing violence or threats of violence of pets to be considered when determining whether the threshold of human trafficking has been met, and including the return of pets to a survivor as a condition of a human trafficking protection order

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The amendments were developed in consultation with the cities of Edmonton, Calgary and Red Deer, and will help the province effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Proposed amendments to the Emergency Management Act include:

Allowing states of local emergency to last for 90 days.
Providing clear language that it is an offence to be non-compliant with orders made under states of local or provincial emergency.
Clarifying that the minister has the power to modify a state of emergency without terminating it.
Clarifying that a provincially declared state of emergency can be for a pandemic in general, and not just for pandemic influenza.


“Our province is facing a truly unprecedented situation. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, so does the need to strengthen our response efforts. This includes listening to our municipal partners and making amendments to the Emergency Management Act that work for both local and provincial governments. We are all in this together, and we must work together to protect Albertans.”
Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs

The Emergency Management Act was amended on March 20 to allow local and provincial states of emergency to exist at the same time, helping communities and the province effectively respond to disasters.
Prior to the amendment, a provincial state of emergency nullified a local state of emergency, taking some powers away from local officials.

“On the first Tuesday of April, Albertans and Canadians celebrate the great service of millions of people who are caregivers to their loved ones with disabilities and dementia.
“Alberta’s population continues to grow and to age, and home is always the best place to be. Family, friends and neighbours provide the loving care that makes it possible for children, adults and the elderly to live at home longer. Three out of four family caregivers also have jobs, which adds to their burden of responsibilities.
“As the COVID-19 pandemic affects the lives of millions, it is an even more important time to recognize caregivers’ personal commitment and sacrifice to better the quality of life of afflicted family members.
“If you are a caregiver, on behalf of all Albertans I offer you a sincere and heartfelt thank you. If you know someone who is a caregiver, please take a moment to honour these incredible fellow Albertans. They will welcome a smile, a wave, a phone call, or any expression of appreciation.”

Emergency Isolation Support closure
The Government of Alberta's Emergency Isolation Support program is now closed after successfully distributing more than $91 million to about 79,600 eligible Albertans over the last 12 days.
The temporary program provided one-time funding for working Albertans required to isolate by public health guidelines, or who had to take care of a dependent who was isolating and were not receiving compensation from any other source during their period of self-isolation. The purpose of the program was to bridge the short period until the Government of Canada announced its own support program.
The Government of Canada’s new Canada Emergency Response Benefit is available and accepting applications. Payments for eligible applicants are retroactive to March 15. 
Temporary employment standards changes
The Government of Alberta is taking immediate action to allow employers to appropriately respond to public health measures and, at the same time, allow employees to remain attached to jobs and have the ability to access federal assistance programs.
Changes for employees

Employees caring for children affected by school and daycare closures or ill or self-isolated family members due to COVID-19 will have access to unpaid job-protected leave. The 90-day employment requirement is waived and leave length is flexible.

Changes for employees and employers

Increasing the maximum time for a temporary layoff from 60 days to 120 days to ensure temporarily laid off employees stay attached to a job longer. This change is retroactive for any temporary layoffs related to COVID-19 that occurred on or after March 17.

Changes for employers

Improving scheduling flexibility by removing the 24-hour written notice requirement for shift changes, and the two weeks’ notice for changes to work schedules for those under an averaging agreement.
Removing the requirement to provide the group termination notice to employees and unions when 50 or more employees are being terminated.
Streamlining the process for approvals related to modifying employment standards so employers and workers can respond quicker to changing conditions at the workplace due to the public health emergency.

Duration
The temporary Employment Standard changes take effect immediately and will be in place as long as government determines it is needed and the public health emergency order remains.
List of essential workplaces
The list of essential workplaces that can continue to operate in Alberta can be found online.
Family violence prevention
An information sheet on family violence prevention and COVID-19 is available online.
Healthy at home
Albertans are encouraged to stay healthy at home by maintaining their physical and mental health during COVID-19. Tips and ideas are available from a variety of online sources, including Active for Life. Post your wellness activities by using the hashtag #HealthyAtHomeAB. 
Bits and Pieces program
More than 2,900 offers of support have poured into the government’s Bits and Pieces program from private and non-profit organizations. Offers include commercial vehicles, hotel rooms and mobile trailers, food and water services, hospital gowns, face masks, ventilators and other personal protective equipment. More information is available online.
Quick facts

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.

Following direction and recommendations provided by the chief medical officer of health, employers have had to adjust operations significantly. The Government of Alberta is taking immediate action to allow employers to appropriately respond to public health measures and at the same time allow employees to remain attached to jobs and have the ability to access federal assistance programs.

“The health and safety of Albertans continues to be our top priority. The Government of Alberta is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19. Changes to the Employment Standards Code will ensure Albertans can care for themselves and their loved ones during these challenging times, while providing flexibility to Alberta’s job creators.”
Jason Copping, Minister of Labour and Immigration


“Our industry has been one of the hardest hit so far by COVID-19, with nearly two-thirds of our workforce now lost. These changes to Alberta’s Employment Standards Code will help food service businesses adapt as needed to the evolving public health situation so that they can remain operational during this extraordinarily difficult time. As Alberta’s third largest private sector employer, the 150,000 workers typically working in our industry depend on the ability of restaurants to be able to survive and recover from this crisis. These changes will build on our efforts to safeguard public health and ensure business continuity as much as possible. They will help provide the relief our job creators need to reopen and rehire once we get through this crisis.”
Mark von Schellwitz, vice-president, Western Canada - Restaurants Canada

“Two years ago, on a rural highway in Saskatchewan, 16 people were killed and 13 injured when a truck collided with the bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos junior hockey team.
“So many of us in this sports-loving province and country have climbed aboard a team bus, or waved goodbye as loved ones did the same. The news on April 6, 2018, was the worst imaginable.
“Since that terrible day, we have seen heartbreak, struggle, grit, and a heroic level of courage. We’ve witnessed the resolve of survivors to rebuild their lives and live in tribute to those who were lost. Canadians gave generously to Broncos families, and the crash inspired more than 150,000 people to register as organ donors.  
“Humboldt’s tragedy was one to which Albertans, Canadians and people around the world felt a personal connection. Humboldt’s legacy – of unity, of compassion, of giving – is one we can all embrace, a much-needed lesson of resilience for our own challenging times.
“As we mark this sad anniversary, we thank the Humboldt Broncos community for the grace they showed in the depths of grief, and the message of hope and love that they continue to share.”

Minister Aheer and Wiebe know the importance of being active while staying at home to slow the spread and do our part to flatten the curve. As Albertans adapt to the current situation, they may find themselves feeling uncertain and unsure of how to stay active in this new normal, or feel unmotivated.

“COVID-19 has created a very different sense of what’s normal. We must adapt to the situation for the good of all Albertans. Erica’s experiences as an Olympic athlete have given her the tools to overcome adversity and adapt to new and difficult situations. Her approach is accessible and positive in a time when we need that most. I hope all Albertans take up the challenge and join us in being active and healthy at home.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women

As a coach, community leader and volunteer ADD athlete, Wiebe wants to emphasize the importance of keeping routines with children to help them develop and maintain physical literacy that can be adapted and practised while at home during the COVID-19 response. She wants Albertans to know there are tools available to support them. She stresses the importance of balance and encourages everyone to take care of their mental health, as well.

“Easing back on certainty-seeking behaviours such as checking the news constantly allows a bit of calmness and routine back in your day. There are many things we can’t control right now, but we can control our physical wellness, routines and thoughts. Take back control – maybe try something new or make a healthy meal every single day, or reach out to someone you haven’t heard from in a long time.”
Erica Wiebe, Ambassador for Sport and Active Living

To maintain active living, Wiebe challenges the minister and all Albertans to try to get outside or get their heart rate up for at least 15-30 minutes every day, or take time to do some body weight exercises, such as squats, burpees or pushups, for repetitions. Deep breathing or meditation can also a great way to manage stress. 
Wiebe and Minister Aheer challenge Albertans to post their home wellness activities during COVID-19 using the hashtag #HealthyAtHomeAB.

“While recognizing that we are facing challenging times as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important we acknowledge the important role wildlife has in our daily lives, and the important role it will have when the threat of the virus is over.
“Albertans are blessed to share our province with more than 1,800 types of flowers, 400 species of birds, 90 mammal species, 18 species of reptiles and amphibians, and 65 species of fish.
“Celebrating National Wildlife Week gives us an opportunity to honour our natural heritage and support conservation efforts across the country.
“I’m passionate about Alberta’s wildlife and wild places. I’m also proud that our government has a robust conservation agenda and is committed to working with conservation groups, industry, municipalities and biologists to ensure wildlife – especially at-risk species – have every opportunity to thrive.
“The excellent work our wildlife professionals conduct is reflected through various programs. For instance, the BearSmart program has helped reduce human-bear interactions, and is an example of successful multi-stakeholder initiatives.
“Another example is the creation of the caribou sub-regional task forces to collaborate on the development of caribou range plans. We aim to achieve and maintain naturally self-sustaining woodland caribou populations.
“As an avid hunter and angler, I also deeply respect that our province offers an abundance of hunting opportunities to Albertans in a safe, responsible and ethical manner.
“My department is currently working to update species management plans and modernize the wildlife regulation. In close collaboration with stakeholders, we will ensure that conservation, wise management and sustainable use of our wildlife resources are incorporated into the work we do every day and in the future. We have already updated the province’s sportfishing regulations with an eye to these details, and there is more to come in that area.
“I hope that when the pandemic ends, you will have the opportunity to get out and enjoy nature. Happy National Wildlife Week.”

Latest updates

Fifty-one of the new 106 cases are laboratory confirmed, and 55 are probable (symptomatic close contacts of laboratory confirmed cases). There is a delay in the reporting of probable cases because those cases are manually entered into the system. This does not reflect a single day increase of 55 new cases. Laboratory positivity rates remain consistent at two per cent.
Strong outbreak measures have been put in place at continuing care facilities.
Cases have been identified in all zones across the province:
	
734 cases in the Calgary zone
290 cases in the Edmonton zone
66 cases in the Central zone
68 cases in the North zone
18 cases in the South zone
Five cases in zones yet to be confirmed


Of these cases, there are currently 42 people in hospital, 14 of which have been admitted to intensive care units (ICU).
Of the 1,181 total cases, 133 are suspected of being community acquired.
There is now a total of 240 confirmed recovered cases.
There have been two additional deaths reported in the Calgary zone for a total of 20 deaths in Alberta. That’s a total of 13 deaths in the Calgary zone, four in the Edmonton zone and three in the North zone.
Alberta Health is tracking nine outbreaks at continuing care facilities. To date, 93 cases have been confirmed at these facilities.
There have been 62,520 people tested for COVID-19, and a total of 64,108 tests performed by the lab. There have been 2,148 tests completed in the last 24 hours.
Aggregate data, showing cases by age range and zone, as well as by local geographic areas, is available online at alberta.ca/covid19statistics.
All Albertans need to work together to help prevent the spread and overcome COVID-19.
Restrictions remain in place for close-contact businesses, dine-in restaurants and non-essential retail services. A full list of restrictions is available online.
Albertans are prohibited from attending gatherings of more than 15 people, and they must continue to observe two metres of physical distancing. This includes events both indoors and outdoors, such as family gatherings, weddings and funerals. Further details are available online.
Alberta Health Services has announced further restrictions for visitors to Alberta hospitals. Details on the restrictions, as well as exceptions, can be found online.
Alberta Health Services has expanded its testing criteria for COVID-19 to include symptomatic individuals in the following roles:
	
Group home and shelter workers
First responders, including firefighters
Those involved in COVID-19 enforcement, including police, peace officers, bylaw officers, environmental health officers, and Fish and Wildlife officers
Correctional facility staff in both provincial and federal facilities


Anyone working in these groups is urged to use Alberta Health Services’ online assessment tool for healthcare workers, enforcement and first responders.

Relief for forest companies
Government is deferring timber dues for six months to help ensure forestry companies can continue operations and retain staff during the pandemic. The move uses existing legislation to support Alberta’s third-largest industry, which is experiencing low markets for its products as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. More information is available online.
Bits and Pieces program
More than 1,100 offers of support have poured into the government’s Bits and Pieces program from private and non-profit organizations. Offers include commercial vehicles, hotel rooms and mobile trailers, food and water services, hospital gowns, face masks, ventilators and other personal protective equipment. More information is available online.
Access to justice updates
Limitation periods are suspended for statutes under the authority of Alberta Justice and Solicitor General. This covers a large variety of legal proceedings. More information is available online.
Outbreak standards for health settings
Alberta’s chief medical officer of health has outlined orders on how to control outbreaks of COVID-19 and protect the residents and staff of licensed supportive living (including group homes and lodges), long-term care (nursing homes and auxiliary hospitals), and residential addiction treatment service providers licensed under the Mental Health Services Protection Act.
Under the orders, operators will be required to notify public health authorities, along with residents, families and staff, as soon as one individual (resident or staff) exhibits COVID-19 symptoms.
Staff who work at multiple facilities are required to immediately inform their supervisors if they have worked or are working at a facility where there is a suspected, probable or confirmed outbreak.
To protect our most vulnerable, in the case of a confirmed outbreak, operators will require staff members to work exclusively at one facility. This is in addition to the worker health screening guidelines that are already in place.
The new standards provide operators with direction, in varying levels of outbreak, on how to deploy staff and resources where most needed, implement isolation measures, and ensure staff have up-to-date training on care and protective equipment.
List of essential workplaces
The list of essential workplaces that can continue to operate in Alberta can be found online.
Emergency isolation supports
Emergency isolation supports are available for Albertans who are self-isolating or who are the sole caregivers for someone in self-isolation, and have no other source of income. Applicants can view eligibility criteria and apply at alberta.ca. To carefully manage the flow of applications, we are periodically closing online access to MADI and the emergency isolation support. We will provide daily updates about system availability.

Alberta is one of the first provinces to utilize existing legislation to defer timber dues in response to the extreme near-term pressures the forest sector is experiencing.

“Alberta’s forest sector is our third largest resource industry, behind energy and agriculture. Ensuring the economic viability for our responsible forest companies will help Alberta families and contribute to our economic recovery.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

This deferral of dues will support companies that have self-isolating staff or constraints that require working from home and help many rural economies by providing stable employment in the forest industry.
The forest industry has been experiencing low markets for lumber, oriented strand board and pulp due to the pandemic.
Quick facts

In 2018, the forest sector directly supported 946 small businesses and 58 medium- and large-sized businesses.
There are 18,700 employed in the forest sector, which also supports 25,000 additional indirect jobs and 90 communities.
Alberta forest product manufacturing contributed almost $2.2 billion to the provincial GDP in 2018.
In 2018, Alberta exported our high-quality forest products around the world, including to the United States ($2.76B), China ($715M), Japan ($294M) and South Korea ($157M).

Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19, including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The offers include passenger and commercial vehicles, hotel rooms and mobile trailers, food and water services, hospital gowns, face masks, ventilators and other personal protective equipment. They also highlight innovation in local manufacturing, with several Alberta distilleries offering sanitizer they produced and a drapery manufacturer offering medical garments and bedding it produced.
The program is named after the “bits and pieces program” established by Canada’s Minister of Munitions and Supply during the Second World War, C. D. Howe. The program coordinated innovative production and procurement efforts from across the Canadian economy to support the war effort.

“I’m deeply touched by the outpouring of support we’re seeing from private and non-profit organizations, both foreign and domestic. When times are tough, Alberta’s spirit of ingenuity and generosity always answers the call.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

One example is ATCO, the Alberta-founded and based company that got its start providing trailers for the oilpatch and is now best known to Albertans as a provider of gas and electricity, which has offered to contribute up to several hundred trailers if needed. These could be used for COVID testing, treatment and quarantining, especially in rural and remote areas without adequate medical facilities.
In addition to many local companies offering and innovating to provide products, Alberta’s post-secondary institutions are leading in areas of research, with one researcher at the University of Alberta working to develop a virus-killing medical mask.

“Albertans are leaders, and I’m humbled to see our province leading and giving back in so many ways. The offers and innovation we’re seeing take place across our province right now will help our government meet the demands and challenges we face today, and the ones we’ll face in the future.”
Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs

The Government of Alberta encourages individuals, private companies and non-profit organizations who can offer products and services, including personal protective equipment, to visit the offers webpage at alberta.ca/covid19.
Examples of Alberta companies filling the need

Under the new orders, staff and operators will be required to notify public health authorities as soon as a case is confirmed or if two or more residents exhibit COVID-19 symptoms.
Staff who work at multiple facilities are required to immediately inform their supervisors if they have worked or are working at a facility where there is a confirmed or suspected case.
Operators and managers must also inform all families with residents in the facilities.
The new standards provide operators with direction on how to deploy staff and resources where most needed, implement isolation measures, and ensure staff have up-to-date training on care and protective equipment.

RESPONSIBLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT ACT (section 5) - Effective April 15, 2020, appoints David Goldie as the chair of the board of directors of the Alberta Energy Regulator for a term to expire on April 14, 2025, and appoints Beverly Yee as a member of the board of directors of the Alberta Energy Regulator for a term to expire on April 14, 2025; reappoints Georgette Habib as a member of the board of directors of the Alberta Energy Regulator for a term to expire on April 14, 2025, and appoints Corrina Bryson, Jude Daniels, Gary Leach and Tracey McCrimmon as members of the board of directors of the Alberta Energy Regulator, each for a term to expire on April 14, 2025.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Starting April 3, parking at all AHS facilities will be free to health-care workers and the general public.
Many health-care workers and physicians are working from home and others need to work at a variety of sites. Removing parking fees and the need for parking passes will make these transitions easier.
The change will also reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread from touch screens and buttons at payment sites.

“Health-care workers and the general public should not have to worry about paying for parking in the midst of responding to COVID-19. Our government will provide whatever resources are needed to protect Albertans during the COVID-19 emergency.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

While parking will be free, visitors are asked to be respectful of spaces allocated for staff, including those for emergency use.
This temporary measure will mean an estimated loss of parking revenue of $7.6 million a month. Alberta joins British Columbia in announcing this decision. Other jurisdictions across the country are expected to follow shortly.
Quick facts

Parking violations, such as parking in fire lanes, will continue to be enforced
The temporary suspension will end once visitor restrictions are lifted.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The non-profit organizations, which will each receive $300,000 or $375,000, have extensive experience serving their communities in Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, Grande Prairie and Fort McMurray.
This $3 million in new funding is in addition to $15.5 million for the school nutrition program. School boards are encouraged to find innovative ways to provide meals or food to students while in-school classes are cancelled.

“Ensuring our students do not go hungry while in-person classes are cancelled is of the utmost importance. We are giving non-profits and school boards the funds and flexibility to find solutions to provide meals or food for students as they learn at home. I commend their efforts to meet students’ needs during this challenging time.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

Some school authorities have developed ways to continue providing food assistance, and many others are planning for alternative arrangements. Those who are unable to continue their school nutrition program must direct their remaining funds to non-profits able to serve vulnerable students in their communities during this pandemic.

“Alberta School Councils’ Association is pleased to see that students in need will continue to receive nutrition support while learning at home. Families will be relieved to know funding will go to local school boards and non-profits in their communities, to best address vulnerable students during this pandemic.”
Allison Pike, president, Alberta School Councils’ Association


“These significant dollars allow us to provide supplementary food packages to the most food insecure families we have been supporting during this school year. The flexibility associated with these funds strengthens our ability to significantly impact monthly the food security of some of our partner schools’ most vulnerable students and families during these unprecedented times.”
Barb Spencer, CEO, e4c

Non-profits receiving funding

e4c – Edmonton: $375,000
Hope Mission – Edmonton and area: $375,000
Calgary Meals on Wheels: $375,000
Brown Bagging for Calgary: $375,000
Breakfast Club of Canada – Fort McMurray and area: $300,000
Salvation Army – Grande Prairie and area: $300,000
Lethbridge Food Bank: $300,000
Medicine Hat and District Food Bank: $300,000
The Mustard Seed Red Deer – Central Alberta: $300,000

Quick facts

Alberta suspended in-school classes indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 15, based on the recommendations of Alberta’s chief medical officer of health.
Funding to school authorities for the nutrition program for the 2019-20 school year is $15.5 million.  
On Nov. 28, 2019, the Alberta government announced a $3 million grant for non-profits to help deliver the school nutrition program. This comes in addition to the $15.5 million already allotted for the 2019-20 nutrition program. 
About 40,000 students received a daily nutritious meal through the school nutrition program in about 450 schools during the first part of the 2019-20 school year.
There are 62 public, separate and Francophone school authorities that received funding for this program.
Thirty-seven of the 62 school boards participating in the school nutrition program have been collaborating with community partners and non-profits prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

Reducing backlog of lab tests
This week, Alberta has seen an upswing in the number of people testing positive for COVID-19. This is because laboratories are quickly dealing with a testing backlog, caused by a delayed shipment over the weekend of reagent, a chemical used in the tests.
The reagent arrived Monday, allowing laboratory technologists to test more samples and confirm more cases. We have conducted more than 4,500 tests in the last 24 hours. Of these, about 98 per cent came back negative, an indicator in line with previous days. A total of 53,141 people have been tested for COVID-19.
Shelter support
The Calgary Drop-In Centre will be opening a shelter at the Calgary TELUS Convention Centre on April 2 for homeless people who are well.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




These appointments will strengthen the regulator’s governance structure through their diverse skill sets and wide-ranging energy experience. The board of directors will focus on increasing stability within the AER, helping the energy industry operate during the COVID-19 pandemic and current challenging economic conditions.

“The new board will bring a steady hand to the AER during these unprecedented economic times. We want to ensure that there is a well-functioning regulator in place. With the leadership provided by the new board, Alberta will continue to be a responsible resource developer.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy


“During our review of the AER, we heard – loudly and clearly – that our government should appoint a new board of directors. We have followed through, and, in the near future, we will announce other initiatives we’re taking to improve the AER’s mandate, governance and system operations. In the meantime, these appointees will help ensure Alberta’s regulatory system is stable and efficient.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks.

As the single regulator for energy development in Alberta, the AER ensures the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of oil, oil sands, natural gas and coal resources over their entire life cycle.
The following individuals have been appointed for five-year terms, effective April 15:

David Goldie, the chair of the board, is a geophysicist and holds an MBA from the University of Calgary. He has more than 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, serving in senior executive level positions with a number of major North American energy companies. He is currently a member of the AER’s interim board of directors.
Georgette Habib holds a master’s degree in economics and is a former full-time board member of the National Energy Board, including serving as chair of the Regulatory Policy Development Committee. She has more than 30 years of experience in both provincial and federal energy regulation. She is currently a member of the AER’s interim board of directors.
Jude Daniels has worked in the energy sector since 1998 as both legal counsel and in Aboriginal relations. Her experience includes working for several large oil and gas companies, as well as leading the first cross-ministry team tasked to develop the original First Nations Consultation Policy for the Government of Alberta.
Gary Leach is a former senior executive with more than 25 years of experience and served as president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada. A lawyer by trade, he has a deep understanding of regulatory issues affecting the energy industry across Western Canada.
Tracey McCrimmon is the executive director of Sundre Petroleum Operators Group. She has extensive experience working in surface land management in more than 40 rural municipality districts and over 20 urban municipalities.
Corrina Bryson is a corporate director and independent consultant with more than 25 years of experience in the energy industry. She currently serves on the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board, Emissions Reduction Alberta, and the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission.
Beverly Yee is deputy minister of Environment and Parks, appointed to the role in September 2018 after serving as deputy minister of Intergovernmental Relations and Agriculture and Forestry. She has also held five assistant deputy roles since joining the Government of Alberta in 1994. She is currently serving as chair of the AER’s interim board of directors.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




To ensure the continuous operation of Alberta’s food supply chain, the provincial government is partnering with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to increase food inspector capacity.
Training will begin soon, which will allow provincial meat inspectors to be deployed into high-priority federally licensed plants in Alberta as demand for more food inspectors increases.

""We must continue to provide high-quality food for Canadians, while ensuring we protect the health of our workers. By working together, our governments have ensured we have a COVID-19 contingency plan for inspection services.""
Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food


“It is critical for Alberta families, our food supply and to our economy that the meat industry operates at its maximum capacity. We are working with the CFIA to integrate our provincial inspectors into federally licenced plants to help keep Albertans fed.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

As a result of COVID-19, the food processing industry is experiencing increased demand. These redeployments will ensure the continued capability to provide meat inspections in the province and keep food products on shelves. In addition, steps have been taken to increase provincial inspector capacity by bringing back retired inspectors.
Protecting the health and safety of inspectors and workers in meat processing facilities is a critical element in meeting the demands of both domestic and export markets.
This move is part of a comprehensive COVID-19 response to keep Albertans safe through this unprecedented global health emergency.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency regulates approximately 74 animal slaughter, meat processing and meat storage establishments in Alberta. These federally inspected plants are vital contributors to the food supply of Albertans and of Canadians.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




In addition to the previously eligible front-line health-care workers, critical infrastructure workers and first responders, child care is now available to anyone who works in the critical areas outlined as essential by government. A full list of those essential service positions can be found here.

“Access to child care should not be a barrier for those who are doing the work required to maintain essential services for all Albertans. We are grateful to the workers for continuing to get the job done and we thank those child care operators for stepping up to provide this important service.”
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services

Parents who work in these areas can contact the child care centres that are open in their communities. An updated list of these centres can be found at alberta.ca/COVID19 (under Info for Albertans). This list will be updated as new centres become available.
Currently, child care centres have reopened in Calgary, Edmonton, Devon, Fort McMurray, Fort Saskatchewan, Grande Prairie, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, Red Deer and Stony Plain. Overall, these centres are at eight per cent of their allotted capacity, so there is room to expand eligibility.
The Alberta government is reopening spaces in four other communities and working with Municipal Affairs, the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association and Rural Municipalities of Alberta to identify areas of need elsewhere.
The centres will be limited to 30 people, including staff, and will have to adhere to strict sanitization practices based on specific instructions from Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.
Parents who qualify for subsidy will receive it and centres will charge their typical rate, within reason. Per direction from Dr. Hinshaw, parents who are eligible should only access this child care if it is the only way they will be able to go to their work in a core service sector. 
As this process involves uncertainty for child care programs, child care centres will be financially compensated for reopened spaces that are not filled. They will also receive up to $500 for the purchase of cleaning supplies.
All other licensed child care centres are to remain closed. Approved family day homes may remain open but limited to six children, not including the operators’ own children.

“The intention to completely destroy a group, culture or religion is the atrocity that is genocide. In April, we join the rest of Canada in recognizing Genocide Remembrance, Condemnation and Prevention Month. This is a time to remember and pay tribute to the victims of mass killings, and to take a stand against the fear and hatred that are the root causes.
“On April 7, we also mark the anniversary of one of the most horrific acts in human history – the genocide of the Tutsi people in Rwanda. Over 100 days, approximately one million people were slaughtered.
“Many Albertans are descendants of people who survived these genocides and we honour their stories. Stories of the Rwandan genocide, the Ukrainian Holodomor, Armenian genocide, Yazidis, and the Holocaust share similar themes. They all caused incredible pain and grief that has impacted generations.  
“We remember these tragedies because we must ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. We need to celebrate our diversity, and recognize that living among people of different backgrounds is a gift.
“In this difficult time, we have the opportunity to reflect on how we create resilient communities here in Alberta. Part of that is learning more about each other and discovering our differences are our strengths. We all want safe homes for our families, freedom to practise our faith and traditions, and opportunities to succeed. The only way we can achieve this is by working together and condemning the racism and discrimination that exists in our world.”

“In April, we honour Sikh heritage month. Alberta’s rich and vibrant Sikh community is a tribute to our incredible diversity and we acknowledge the many contributions of Sikh Canadians in our own communities.
“The first Sikh pioneers to Alberta were miners, farmers and lumber workers. They helped build this province from the ground up and supported other immigrants in Alberta.
“Today, the community is thriving. Alberta has the third largest Sikh population in Canada, which continues to help our province flourish. The Sikh community’s values of family, philanthropy and service are an example for all Albertans to follow.
“This month, Sikhs will recognize Vaisakhi, a celebration of their faith and history. It is a spring harvest festival and commemorates the creation of the Khalsa Panth by the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, which promotes the creation of a just and equal society.
“Over the next few months, we will need to find new and creative ways to celebrate cultural events such as Vaisakhi. As we self-isolate and practise social distancing, emotional and mental support from our community is more important than ever. However you are celebrating, I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Based on feedback heard at open house events held across the province over the winter and online through our TalkAEP portal, the 2020 regulations feature new or additional opportunities to harvest walleye, northern pike and yellow perch from water bodies with sustainable populations.

“Fishing is an important part of Alberta’s cultural fabric. This winter, Albertans told us they wanted additional opportunities to catch and keep fish from water bodies where additional harvest is sustainable. I’m very pleased that we were able to identify and offer additional angling and conservation opportunities in most areas of the province for the 2020 season. Remember, when you’re out on the water to ensure you’re practising social distancing and following all public health advice. ”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

Alberta’s sport fishing regulations support a fisheries management system that aims to make our fisheries strong, healthy, vibrant and sustainable for future generations.

“The Alberta Fish and Game Association is pleased with the changes to the 2020 Alberta Guide to Sportfishing Regulations and want to thank Minister Nixon and his staff for beginning to address longstanding concerns. We know that more positive changes will occur in the future. Even during these trying times, outdoor activities such as fishing are possible provided they are done in the context of the orders and guidelines outlined by Alberta Health during what, at the present time, is a public health emergency.”
Delinda Ryerson, executive director, Alberta Fish and Game Association

The additional opportunities included in the 2020 regulations are meant to complement the province’s conservation efforts along the eastern slopes to support a healthy fish habitat and the recovery of westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout and Athabasca rainbow trout.
About 300,000 anglers fish Alberta’s lakes and rivers every year, with sport fishing contributing more than $600 million annually to Alberta’s economy.
The 2020 Alberta Sportfishing Regulations come into effect on April 1.
While enjoying the outdoors, we encourage all Albertans to practise appropriate physical distancing and abide by the other public health recommendations. Government looks forward to working toward additional fisheries changes with input from Alberta anglers and conservationists.
Quick facts

Harvest slot-size limits are being implemented on almost 30 walleye fisheries and more than 10 pike fisheries.
Regulations that provide increased harvest using a one fish daily bag limit (with no size restriction) will be in place for seven walleye and 21 pike fisheries.
The number of lakes with tag-based harvest of walleye has decreased from 23 to 16, but the overall number of Class A and B walleye available to special harvest licence has increased.
In order to support social distancing measures in response to COVID-19, Albertans are encouraged to purchase their 2020 Alberta sport fishing licence online at AlbertaRELM.com.
Anglers can also carry their fishing licence electronically on the AlbertaRELM app.

Two of the bills, if passed, will bring into force the public health enforcement activities and rental protections announced by Premier Jason Kenney on March 27. An additional bill is proposed to support economic activity in the energy sector in light of job losses due to COVID-19 and the recent oil price wars.

“We continue to prioritize the health, safety, security and economic interests of all Albertans during this unprecedented time. We know there is a tremendous amount of stress being felt in the province. To combat this, we are proposing two bills that include decisive actions to protect Albertans and ultimately help reduce the spread of this virus, and a third bill to support jobs in the energy sector.”
Jason Nixon, Government House Leader

The two proposed bills meant to support and protect Albertans during COVID-19 include:

Bill 10, Public Health (Emergency Powers) Amendment Act, 2020
If passed, this bill will provide law enforcement agencies full authority to enforce public health orders during a pandemic.


Bill 11, Tenancies Statutes (Emergency Provisions) Amendment Act, 2020
If passed, this bill will ensure no one will be retroactively charged for residential rent increases or late fees while the state of public health emergency is in effect.

In addition to debating these bills, government is proposing Bill 12, Liabilities Management Statutes Amendment Act, 2020. If passed, this bill will enable government to clarify and enable expanded, delegated authority for the Orphan Well Association to maintain and manage orphan sites. 

“Government has provided an additional $100 million to the Orphan Well Association. With this proposed legislation, we are aiming to help the association accelerate the cleanup of orphaned wells and associated infrastructure. Fast-tracking this work will boost employment in our oil services sector and protect jobs during these challenging economic times.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

“Our government understands that this is a challenging period of uncertainty for many Albertans. We want to assure people we are working quickly to ensure that legislation relevant to fighting the spread of COVID-19 and that our economy is set up for success once the worst of the virus passes. Albertans can be certain we are working diligently with the Opposition to address the challenges associated with COVID-19.”   
Jason Nixon, Government House Leader

Legislation to be debated deals with a number of issues, including modernizing the Public Health Act and protecting mobile home residents. Government will also be tabling legislation that updates the process for managing well liabilities in the province, which will create conditions to help the province’s oil and gas industries rebound once the pandemic is over.

“Effectively managing oil and gas liabilities, including orphan wells and sites, is important in maintaining our reputation as a responsible energy producer. Enhancing the role of the Orphan Well Association plays a significant role in reducing the number of inactive sites in Alberta while at the same time creating jobs to support our economy. This ensures a sustainable oil and gas industry in our province for generations to come.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy

Government will be working with the Opposition to ensure MLAs are doing all they can to adhere to the best practices outlined by the chief medical officer of health. The health and safety of members and all Albertans remains our highest priority.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.





The Government of Alberta has finalized an agreement with Calgary-based TC Energy Corporation to provide financial support to accelerate construction of the KXL pipeline starting April 1. This investment will include $1.5 billion in equity investment in 2020 followed by a $6 billion loan guarantee in 2021. The project is expected to be completed and in service in 2023.
This agreement is the culmination of six months of negotiations, as well as rigorous vetting by government officials and outside industry experts to ensure the success of this project, while minimizing risk to taxpayers.
The government is backstopping the project to enable TC Energy to begin immediate construction on the Alberta portion of the pipeline. This will ensure the earliest possible date of completion. The project will create over 1,400 direct and 5,400 indirect jobs in Alberta during construction and will generate an estimated $30 billion in tax and royalty revenues for future generations of Albertans and Canadians.

“We cannot wait for the end of the pandemic and the global recession to act. There are steps we must make now to build our future focussed on jobs, the economy, and pipelines. Today we are moving forward with a project that is essential to our future prosperity. This investment in Keystone XL is a bold move to re-take control of our province’s economic destiny and put it firmly back in the hands of the owners of our natural resources, the people of Alberta. The Government of Alberta is confident that this is a wise investment. After construction is complete, we will be able to sell our shares at profit. In addition, the project will have a net return of over $30 billion to the Alberta taxpayer through royalties and higher prices for Alberta oil in the next 20 years.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Once operational, Keystone XL will provide North America with a stable, secure supply of crude oil, reducing reliance on supply from OPEC. The pipeline will carry at least 830,000 barrels per day of Alberta crude, significantly increasing the province’s takeaway capacity and helping to protect the value of its energy resources.
Right now Alberta’s oil export capacity is limited by the lack of pipelines. Without the ability to export more oil, there is no incentive for producers to invest in more production in Alberta. Completing KXL will signal to the oil and gas industry, and to investors around the world, that they have a future in Alberta. Without more pipelines, the future of our oil and gas industry is capped; with today’s announcement, employers and investors should have the confidence to maintain existing projects and to spend new money on new projects.
Construction will begin immediately in Alberta, at the Canada-US border, in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska.
The Keystone XL Pipeline offers a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible way to deliver crude oil from western Canadian oil fields to Gulf Coast refineries in the U.S. The project will run from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska and will cover 1,947 kilometres.
Given the significance of this issue, the Government will present a related motion for debate and vote this week.

An additional 29 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 690. While these numbers are lower than in recent days, this may be attributed to fewer lab tests completed due to challenges with lab testing supplies. Lab testing is now back to full capacity.
Latest updates

Cases have been identified in all zones across the province:
	
422 cases in the Calgary zone
164 cases in the Edmonton zone
46 cases in the Central zone
45 cases in the North zone
12 cases in the South zone
One case in a zone that is yet to be confirmed


Of these cases, there are currently 28 people in hospital, with 11 admitted to intensive care units (ICU).
In total, there have been 47 hospitalizations, with 17 admissions to ICUs.
Sixty-five of the 690 cases are suspected of being community acquired.
There are now a total of 94 confirmed recovered cases.
There have been a total of five new deaths reported since the March 29 report – two in the Edmonton zone, two in the Calgary zone, and one in the North zone. There are now a total of eight deaths in Alberta.


Two people from the McKenzie Towne Long Term Care have passed away. Forty-one people are confirmed to have tested positive for the virus at the facility – 36 are residents and five are staff.  

Linkages have been made to this outbreak over the last few days and the reported cases are not all from the last 24 hours.

The person who tested positive at Edmonton’s Rosedale on the Park facility has also died.
The Edmonton zone recently reported an outbreak at Shepherd’s Care Kensington. The number of cases remains at four in that facility.

Exploring faster lab testing
Alberta Health Services (AHS) is partnering with a Canadian technology company to provide rapid testing for COVID-19 for Alberta.
Spartan Bioscience is developing a COVID-19 test kit that would allow AHS lab workers to test for suspected COVID-19 in rural communities, rather than needing to send test samples to the two centralized laboratories in Edmonton and Calgary. More details are available in this AHS news release.
Isolation rules
To align with new federal rules under the Quarantine Act, Albertans under mandatory self-isolation are now required to remain inside and can only go for walks on their own property, such as their backyard, for the duration of their self-isolation.

They can no longer go for walks in their neighbourhoods or through parks until their self-isolation period ends.
People who live in apartment buildings or highrises must stay inside and cannot use the elevators or stairwells to go outside.

This applies to everyone in mandatory self-isolation – those who are feeling well and those who have symptoms of COVID-19 including cough, fever, shortness of breath or a runny nose.
Albertans are legally required to self-isolate for 14 days if they:

returned from travel outside of Canada after March 12
are a close contact of a person who tested positive for COVID-19 (provides care, lives with or has close physical contact, or comes into direct contact with infectious body fluids)

If you become sick during this time, you must self-isolate for an additional 10 days from the beginning of symptoms or until you are feeling well, whichever takes longer. Read more about how to self-isolate.
Charities and non-profit organizations

List of essential workplaces

Mental health supports
AHS has boosted its service to help Albertans should they need to speak with someone about mental health concerns.
If Albertans call the Mental Health Help Line at 1-877-303-2642 or the Addiction Help Line at 1-866-332-2322 between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., seven days a week, they will be connected directly to a dedicated team of AHS addiction and mental health staff.
This will allow the 811 health team to focus on COVID-19 calls during the day and improve wait times for others needing telephone advice. Calls placed from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. will continue to be routed through 811.
Emergency isolation supports
Emergency isolation supports are available for Albertans who are self-isolating or who are the sole caregivers for someone in self-isolation, and have no other source of income.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The overwhelming majority of the CEC’s budget was intended for paid advertising campaigns that cannot proceed during the COVD-19 pandemic. As a result, the CEC has reduced its current spending to subsistence operations at this time.
Spending will be limited to functions such as continuing and preparing research, office infrastructure and administrative support. If applied on an annual basis, this reflects a 90 per cent reduction in the CEC’s operating budget from $30 million to $2.84 million.
The CEC plans to maintain a reduced budget for a period of three months or until regular operations can recommence. This includes taking steps to end all paid advertising campaigns, pausing work with outside contractors and ensuring it is well-positioned to resume operations when the time is right.

“Global energy demand is down dramatically because of reduced consumption due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Saudi-initiated price war. But in time, demand will recover. The world still needs reliable energy. While some would like to capitalize on this unprecedented crisis to permanently shut down Canadian oil and gas, we do not believe we should surrender the global energy market to these opponents. The CEC will continue to be required to promote and defend Canadian energy.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy

Two-thirds of the CEC’s allocated budget is provided directly from industry via the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) levy. The remaining third consists of reallocated advertising funds from previous budgets.

At about 7 p.m., officers from Lakeshore Regional Police Service (LRPS) responded to a disturbance complaint at a residence on the Sucker Creek First Nation. It was reported that an intoxicated person had damaged property and threatened an occupant of the house. High Prairie RCMP officers attended to assist the LRPS officers.
The subject of the complaint, a 20-year-old man, was located and placed under arrest. During the arrest, a struggle occurred and a conductive energy weapon (CEW), commonly referred to as a Taser, was deployed. After being restrained and removed from the residence, the man went into medical distress. An ambulance attended the scene and transported the man to a nearby hospital. He was subsequently transferred by air ambulance to another hospital, where he remains in stable condition and is expected to make a full recovery.
With ASIRT’s investigation underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

Early this year, government consulted with farmers, industry and key partners in the agricultural sector. From that engagement, there was a consensus that farmers, in collaboration with others involved in research, are best positioned to determine agricultural research priorities.
RDAR’s structure takes the best parts of previous research models, such as Alberta Livestock and Meat Agency (ALMA) and Alberta Crop Industry Development Fund (ACIDF), as it ensures research reflects the priorities of farmers and ranchers. It is imperative that agriculture research in Alberta achieves outcomes that can be applied in the field and on the ranch.
A regionally reflective advisory board will assist the interim board with important projects to ensure value, profitability and areas of focus.

“We will make sure farmers direct research priorities. RDAR will ensure Alberta’s agriculture industry has more financial flexibility and autonomy to fund longer-term projects. Governments shouldn’t force ideology on research priorities – research priorities should be determined by industry. Research can be a massive springboard for economic growth and, with the right focus, RDAR can achieve that for Alberta’s farmers and ranchers.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

An interim board and CEO has been put in place to establish RDAR. Research funding will begin flowing by September 2020 and achieve full operational capacity by March 2021. Through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, $2 million in grant funding will be provided this year to support initial operations, which will allow RDAR to begin focusing on priority research right away.

“We know a new system needs to be established with the voices of producers strongly considered and driving research initiatives while working in a collaborative environment with scientists and others. This new model will ensure predictable, long-term funding. We’re looking forward to working with our partners to make that a reality.”
Dr. David Chalack, interim board chair, Results Driven Agriculture Research

Aggressive public health measures continue to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Latest updates

Cases have been identified in all zones across the province:
	
408 cases in the Calgary zone
149 cases in the Edmonton zone
46 cases in the Central zone
45 cases in the North zone
12 cases in the South zone
One case in a zone that is yet to be confirmed


Of these cases, there have been 41 hospitalizations, with 14 admissions to intensive care units (ICU), and three deaths reported.
Up to 60 of the 661 cases may be due to community transmission.


McKenzie Towne Long Term Care has 11 new cases identified, bringing the total to 26 at that facility. There are no reported changes for Rosedale on the Park (one case) and Shepherd’s Care Kensington Village (four cases).
There are now a total of 73 confirmed recovered cases.
Aggregate data, showing cases by age range and zone, as well as by local geographical areas, is available online at alberta.ca/covid19statistics.
All Albertans need to work together to help prevent the spread and overcome COVID-19.
Restrictions remain in place for close-contact businesses, dine-in restaurants and non-essential retail services. A full list of restrictions is available online.
Albertans are prohibited from attending gatherings of more than 15 people, and they must continue to observe two metres of social distancing. This includes events both indoors and outdoors, such as family gatherings, weddings and funerals. Further details are available online.

Vehicle restrictions in parks and recreation areas
Vehicle access to provincial parks, and parking lots and staging areas on public land has been suspended to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, in addition to facilities that have also been closed. Alberta Environment and Parks is doing its part to protect Albertans and parks employees. Included in the vehicle access closures are provincial recreation areas and public land recreation areas, where parking lots and staging areas exist.
List of essential workplaces
The list of essential workplaces that can continue to operate in Alberta can be found online.
Mental health supports
AHS has boosted its service to help Albertans should they need to speak with someone about mental health concerns.
If Albertans call the Mental Health Help Line at 1-877-303-2642 or the Addiction Help Line at 1-866-332-2322 between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., seven days a week, they will be connected directly to a dedicated team of AHS addiction and mental health staff.
This will allow the 811 health team to focus on COVID-19 calls during the day and improve wait times for others needing telephone advice. Calls placed from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. will continue to be routed through 811.
Emergency isolation supports
Emergency isolation supports are available for Albertans who are self-isolating or who are the sole caregivers for someone in self-isolation, and have no other source of income. Applicants can view eligibility criteria and apply at alberta.ca. To carefully manage the flow of applications, we are periodically closing access to MADI and the emergency isolation support. We will provide daily updates about system availability.
There is no formal deadline for emergency isolation support. This is a temporary program to bridge the gap until the Federal Emergency Care Benefit is available.
Quick facts

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately, and staying home and away from others if you are sick.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.

There are now a total of 53 confirmed recovered cases.

Increased security for Alberta renters
A new package of direct supports and deferrals is being provided to ensure security for residential renters amid the financial burden brought on by the COVID-19 crisis. Tenants will be protected from eviction for non-payment before May 1, 2020, rents will not increase during the state of public health emergency and late fees cannot be applied to rent payments for three months.
Vehicle restrictions in parks and recreation areas
Automobile access is temporarily suspended at all provincial park and recreation area access points. This matches the restrictions currently in place at national parks.
List of essential workplaces
The list of essential workplaces that can continue to operate in Alberta can be found online.
Recruiting physicians
The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta has developed an online tool for Alberta physicians to self-report their ability to be redeployed to help with the COVID-19 pandemic. Once the College has identified doctors who can provide additional services, AHS will help with recruitment and ensure the doctors are deployed to the areas of greatest need where they will have the most impact.
Operating guide for continuing care
A new guide with mandated directions on how to respond to and prevent COVID-19 concerns and cases has been posted online for operators of continuing care facilities, seniors lodges, residential addiction treatment facilities and licensed facilities for person with disabilities.
Diagnostic imaging and lab tests
Effective immediately, Alberta Health Services (AHS) is postponing some diagnostic imaging procedures as part of the effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect Albertans. Imaging deemed to be non-urgent by the ordering physician will be postponed.
AHS will work closely with patients whose exams are being rescheduled. Patients whose conditions change should connect with their physicians.
To free up more laboratory space for COVID-19 testing, physicians and community providers are being asked to immediately stop all non-essential and routine laboratory testing.
Flexibility for municipal governments
Government has added a new COVID-19 containment measure under the Municipal Government Act (MGA) called the COVID-19 Suppression Regulation. This gives local governments flexibility in doing business during the COVID-19 outbreak, including the option to hold meetings while still observing physical distancing. Municipal Affairs has extended a number of reporting timelines under the MGA, giving municipalities the time and ability to deliver on the needs of their residents and meet the requirements set out by the act.
Mental health supports
AHS has boosted its service to help Albertans should they need to speak with someone about mental health concerns.
If Albertans call the Mental Health Help Line at 1-877-303-2642 or the Addiction Help Line at 1-866-332-2323 between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., seven days a week, they will be connected directly to a dedicated team of AHS addiction and mental health staff.
This change will allow the 811 health team to focus on COVID-19 calls during the day and improve wait times for others needing telephone advice. Calls placed from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. will continue to be routed through 811.
Pausing some health construction projects and non-essential service contracts
In order to protect patients, families and staff providing key services inside health-care facilities, AHS has informed some contractors and vendors that provide non-essential services at some health facilities that their projects will be temporarily paused.
These include non-essential delivery services and facility maintenance, such as flooring replacement, departmental renovations or lighting retrofit projects.
Alberta Infrastructure is also working with AHS to ensure that construction projects being done inside health facilities do not impact the operations of the facility.
As each project is reviewed and assessed, Infrastructure will provide notice to affected contractors if any projects are deferred.
Emergency isolation supports
Emergency isolation supports are available for Albertans who are self-isolating or who are the sole caregivers for someone in self-isolation, and have no other source of income. Applicants can view eligibility criteria and apply at alberta.ca. To carefully manage the flow of applications, we are periodically closing access to MADI and the emergency isolation support. We will provide daily updates about system availability.
There is no formal deadline for emergency isolation support. This is a temporary program to bridge the gap until the Federal Emergency Care Benefit is available.
Access to justice
Effective March 30, 2020, public access to all courthouses in Alberta will be restricted until further notice. Members of the general public will only be permitted to enter a courthouse in certain circumstances. More information: https://www.albertacourts.ca/qb/resources/announcements/notice-to-the-public-and-legal-profession-restricted-access-to-courthouses.
The Court of Queen’s Bench is accepting requests for emergency/urgent hearings in all criminal, family, commercial and civil matters online or over the phone (for parties without access to the internet). More information: https://www.albertacourts.ca/qb/resources/announcements/requests-to-the-court-for-emergency-urgent-hearings.
Food supply
Despite higher retail demand, Alberta’s food supply remains secure. Government is in regular contact with other levels of government, producers, distributors, retailers and processors to ensure it stays that way. We are working with food banks and Indigenous communities to understand their needs and ensure everyone has access to the food supplies they need.
Medical evaluation for drivers’ licences
Alberta Transportation has extended the timeline to 90 days for most drivers requiring a medical evaluation to complete their medical form when applying for or renewing their licence. This will reduce the current strain on the health-care system. Medically high-risk drivers will still be required to present their medical evaluation at the time of their application or renewal.
Offers of help
The Alberta Emergency Management Agency Unsolicited Offers Program has been set up in response to growing offers of generosity from individuals and organizations to help with the challenges many Albertans are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those wanting to help can go to alberta.ca/COVID19offersprogram for more information.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




While funding for teachers and most other aspects of the K-12 system is being maintained, funding for transportation and some services not being utilized in an at-home learning environment, such as substitute teachers and educational assistants, is being temporarily reduced while in-person classes remain cancelled. Any savings from these adjustments will be re-allocated to support Alberta’s COVID-19 response.
These funding adjustments will not negatively impact Alberta’s education continuity plan. School authorities will receive the funding they require to continue providing at-home learning opportunities to their students, ensuring they do not fall behind.

“COVID-19 has changed both how we provide student learning, and the operational needs of the education system. I want to stress that this is a temporary arrangement as schools focus on at-home learning. I have full confidence the system will continue to be equipped to successfully deliver our education continuity plan.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

Any staff impacted by these funding adjustments will qualify for the federal government’s enhanced employment insurance program and other support programs for Canadian workers.
Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19, including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

“Many Albertans are practising physical distancing right now, so what better time to learn about our province’s wildlife? Our partners at AHEIA have generously offered to make the new Alberta Fishing Education Program available free of charge, and we hope Albertans – kids and adults – will take advantage of this opportunity. I recently took the course along with my two youngest children, and the three of us learned so much about the aquatic biodiversity of our province!”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks


“Given the current set of circumstances everyone is dealing with, we feel now is the perfect time to release the Alberta Fishing Education Program for free, so that all Albertans – young and old – can take advantage of this extra time they may have found themselves with while they self-isolate or quarantine at home away from school and work.”
Robert Gruszecki, Alberta Hunter Education Instructors’ Association

The Alberta Fishing Education Program is the only program of its kind offered in North America. Its aim, beyond providing essential education about fishing in Alberta, is to provide confidence through understanding to better enable more people to responsibly spend time in the outdoors and enjoy and preserve our province’s most beautiful wild places and wildlife.
AHEIA is a not-for-profit organization that works to educate the public on the importance of protecting the places and wildlife cherished by Albertans. AHEIA is the only registered charity in Alberta that provides this type of conservation and outdoor education to the public and has done so since 1964.

The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta has developed an online tool for Alberta physicians to self-report their ability to be redeployed to help with the COVID-19 pandemic. Once the College has identified doctors who can provide additional services, AHS will help with recruitment and ensure the doctors are deployed to the areas of greatest need where they will have the most impact.
Operating guide for continuing care
A new guide with mandated directions on how to respond to and prevent COVID-19 concerns and cases has been posted online for operators of continuing care facilities, seniors lodges, residential addiction treatment facilities and licensed facilities for person with disabilities.
Diagnostic imaging and lab tests
Effective immediately, Alberta Health Services (AHS) is postponing some diagnostic imaging procedures as part of the effort to prevent spread of COVID-19 and protect Albertans. Imaging deemed to be non-urgent by the ordering physician will be postponed.
AHS will work closely with patients whose exams are being rescheduled. Patients whose conditions change should connect with their physicians.
To free up more laboratory space for COVID-19 testing, physicians and community providers are being asked to immediately stop all non-essential and routine laboratory testing.
Flexibility for municipal governments
Government has added a new COVID-19 containment measure under the Municipal Government Act (MGA) called the COVID-19 Suppression Regulation. This gives local governments flexibility in doing business during the COVID-19 outbreak, including the option to hold meetings while still observing physical distancing. Municipal Affairs has extended a number of reporting timelines under the MGA, giving municipalities the time and ability to deliver on the needs of their residents and meet the requirements set out by the Act.
Mental health supports
AHS has boosted its service to help Albertans should they need to speak with someone about mental health concerns.
If Albertans call the Mental Health Help Line at 1-877-303-2642 or the Addiction Help Line at 1-866-332-2323 between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., seven days a week, they will be connected directly to a dedicated team of AHS addiction and mental health staff.
This change will support 811 operators to focus on COVID-19 calls during the day and improve wait times for others needing telephone advice. Calls placed from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. will continue to be routed through 811.
Pausing some health construction projects and non-essential service contracts
In order to protect patients, families and staff providing key services inside health-care facilities, AHS has informed some contractors and vendors that provide non-essential services at some health facilities that their projects will be temporarily paused.
These include non-essential delivery services and facility maintenance, such as flooring replacement, departmental renovations or lighting retrofit projects.
Alberta Infrastructure is also working with AHS to ensure that construction projects being done inside health facilities do not impact the operations of the facility.
As each project is reviewed and assessed, Infrastructure will provide notice to affected contractors if any projects are deferred.
Emergency isolation supports
Emergency isolation supports are available for Albertans who are self-isolating or who are the sole caregivers for someone in self-isolation, and have no other source of income. Applicants can view eligibility criteria and apply at alberta.ca. To carefully manage the flow of applications, we are periodically closing access to MADI and the Emergency Isolation Support. We will provide daily updates about system availability.
Access to justice
Effective March 30, 2020, public access to all courthouses in Alberta will be restricted until further notice. Members of the general public will only be permitted to enter a courthouse in certain circumstances. More information: https://www.albertacourts.ca/qb/resources/announcements/notice-to-the-public-and-legal-profession-restricted-access-to-courthouses.

The Court of Queen’s Bench is accepting requests for emergency/urgent hearings in all criminal, family, commercial and civil matters online or over the phone (for parties without access to the internet). More information: https://www.albertacourts.ca/qb/resources/announcements/requests-to-the-court-for-emergency-urgent-hearings.
Food supply
Despite higher retail demand, Alberta’s food supply remains secure. Government is in regular contact with other levels of government, producers, distributors, retailers and processors to ensure it stays that way. We are working with food banks and Indigenous communities to understand their needs and ensure everyone has access to the food supplies they need.
Medical evaluation for drivers’ licences
Alberta Transportation has extended the timeline to 90 days for most drivers requiring a medical evaluation to complete their medical form when applying for or renewing their licence. This will reduce the current strain on the health-care system. Medically high-risk drivers will still be required to present their medical evaluation at the time of their application or renewal.
Offers of help
The Alberta Emergency Management Agency Unsolicited Offers Program has been set up in response to growing offers of generosity from individuals and organizations to help with the challenges many Albertans are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those wanting to help can go to alberta.ca/COVID19offersprogram for more information.
Quick facts

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately, and staying home and away from others if you are sick.

As a result of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, attendance at certain businesses and organizations across the province will be prohibited effective immediately.  

“This was a difficult decision to make, but we must do everything we can to protect the safety of Albertans and limit the spread of COVID-19. Grocery stores, pharmacies, delivery services and other essential businesses will continue to provide Albertans with the goods and services they need, and we’ll look to Alberta’s business leaders to find innovative ways to continue remote operations and protect jobs. These businesses must do everything they can to safeguard the well-being of the hardworking employees on the front lines.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Restrictions will be in place for the following classifications of business:

Close contact businesses including hair salons and barbershops, tattoo and piercing studios, esthetic services, as well as wellness studios and clinics and non-emergency and non-critical health services provided by regulated health professionals or registered professionals including dentistry, physiotherapy, massage, podiatry, chiropractic and optometry services.
Dine-in restaurants will no longer be able to offer dine-in service. Take-out and delivery services will continue to be available.
Non-essential retail services that fall into the categories of clothing, computer and gaming stores, and services in shopping malls and shopping centres such as hobby and toys, gift and specialty items and furniture.

A more complete list of affected businesses is available online.
In addition, people are prohibited from attending gatherings of more than 15, and they must observe two metres of social distancing. This includes:

open spaces such as trails, fields and parks
public and private gatherings where people are brought together in a single room or space at the same time, including funerals, weddings and other formal and informal events

Further details on gathering restrictions are available online.
Workplaces that have not been ordered to close can continue to have more than 15 workers on a worksite as long as those business maintain public health measures, including two metre social distancing, hygiene enforcement and processes that ensure that any person who is ill does not attend these spaces.

“These are aggressive measures and we don’t take them lightly. We need to do everything we can to flatten the curve and keep people healthy. I strongly encourage all Albertans to stay close to home as we are all in this together. Our collective action will protect our family, friends and neighbours.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

Any business or organization not following the public health order will be subject to a fine. Courts have the power to administer fines of up to $100,000 for a first offence and up to $500,000 for a subsequent offence for more serious violations. Individuals aware of any businesses violating these orders should submit a complaint online immediately.
Quick facts

All Albertans have a responsibility to help prevent the spread. Take steps to protect yourself and others:
	
practise social distancing
stay home and away from others if sick or in isolation
practise good hygiene – wash hands often for at least 20 seconds, cover coughs and sneezes, and avoid touching your face
monitor for symptoms, such as cough, fever, fatigue or difficulty breathing

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The restrictions, which came into effect March 27 at 1 p.m. through two ministerial orders, are in place to help stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus and are the same restrictions currently in place at national parks. Last weekend revealed a disturbing trend of people not exercising physical distancing and leaving behind garbage and human waste in some provincial parks.
Alberta’s chief medical officer of health has advised that Parks facilities, like washrooms, can only remain open if Parks staff have access to personal protective gear for cleaning. Government recognizes that these scarce resources are needed in Alberta’s health-care and social services front lines, which is why facilities will remain closed and access restricted to help reduce the spread of the virus.
Albertans who choose to access the province’s parks and recreation areas should follow the advice of government health experts on physical distancing and public gatherings.

“We understand the need to get outdoors, but now is not the time to visit our provincial parks and recreation areas without abiding by common-sense public health and safety measures. We are asking all Albertans to assist us by complying with the public access restriction and to stay home during this critical time. If you have plans to travel to a provincial park or provincial recreation area, please rethink your plans. We all need to do our part to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 among vulnerable Albertans, including ensuring protective gear is available for the service providers that need it most. If you decide to access parks and recreation areas at this time, please leave the area better than how you found it.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

The suspension applies to motor vehicle access to parking lots and staging areas. Albertans should choose recreation opportunities close to home, like going for a walk in their neighbourhood, but if they do travel to provincial parks or recreation sites, access is by non-motorized means only.
The restrictions do not apply to forestry or oil and gas operations.
Access for First Nations and identified Metis Harvesters is still permitted. Physical distancing and mass gathering restrictions still apply.
Enforcement officers will be doing routine checks in provincial parks and on public land to support education and awareness on the temporary closure. Officers can issue fines for non-compliance, if required.
We are asking Albertans to exercise good judgment. Vehicles should not be left on the side of the road or on private property. If a car is required to be left behind while using a park or public land, do not go. Horseback and off-highway vehicle use are still permitted where legal, and users are reminded to practise physical distancing.
Alberta Parks facilities, including toilets and picnic and warm-up shelters, have been closed for more than a week to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. No Parks staff are currently supporting facility operations so visitor safety cannot be ensured.
Improperly disposed of garbage and waste also has the potential to draw wildlife, like bears coming out of hibernation, close to  facilities and amenities, which creates an issue for when provincial parks resume normal operations. Fines of up to $250 for littering will be issued to users who dispose of garbage improperly. Albertans are asked to take out whatever they take in with them when they visit parks and public lands.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




This is part of an overall $7.7-billion package in direct supports and deferrals designed to relieve the immediate financial burden brought on by the crisis and provide stability during these unprecedented and uncertain times.
The new protections mean:

Effective immediately, tenants cannot be evicted for non-payment of rent and/or utilities before May 1.
Effective immediately, rents will not increase while Alberta’s state of public health emergency remains in effect.
Effective April 1, late fees cannot be applied to late rent payments for the next three months.
Effective April 1, landlords and tenants need to work together to develop payment plans while the state of public health emergency is in effect.


“We want to be clear: As of today, no one will be facing immediate eviction from their home for non-payment of rent or utilities owed to the landlord. Additionally, tenants will not face increasing financial pressure from rent increases or fees for late rent payments. We are expecting landlords and tenants to work together to figure out payment plans that help everyone meet financial obligations as we manage COVID-19, and we are doing further policy work on support for renters during these tough times.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“We’ve been listening to the financial concerns of landlords and tenants and these measures protect Albertans and give them time to get back on their feet. This is more practical relief from the immediate financial pressures on Albertans – on top of emergency isolation supports, deferrals of utility bill and student loan payments, an education property tax freeze, and ATB Financial mortgage deferrals.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta

Payment plans and eviction process
While Alberta is in a state of public health emergency, landlords must attempt to work out a payment plan with tenants who are unable to make their full rent when payment is due. The Residential Tenancy Dispute Resolution Service (RTDRS) will not hear applications that could lead to eviction due to non-payment unless a reasonable attempt has been made to work out a payment plan.
Rental increases
Until the state of public health emergency has been lifted, landlords cannot raise the rent on residential properties or mobile home sites, even if notice of an increase has already been given.
Late fees
Until June 30, landlords cannot further penalize tenants who are late on rent by charging late fees, even if the signed rental agreement states that a late fee can be applied. Landlords will also not be able to retroactively collect late fees for this period.

“As housing providers, we fully support our provincial leaders, so together, we can support all residential renters in Alberta affected by COVID-19 and continue to provide the essential service of a safe, healthy and peaceful place to call home through flexibility and mutual resolve. Together, we will all get through this.”
Sam Kolias, chief executive officer, Boardwalk


“The government’s plan to offer rental protections to people unable to pay their rent due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to me, seems like an excellent step forward in battling this public health crisis. Helping Albertans by not allowing evictions next month and asking landlords to create payment plans with tenants will save great suffering and will prevent a worsening of the pandemic.”
Leif Gregersen, renter

Quick facts

These protections are required by new ministerial orders under the Residential Tenancies Act and the Mobile Homes Sites Tenancies Act.
Landlords can still file applications and receive orders for possession if the reason for the eviction is unrelated to rent and/or utility payments (e.g. safety concerns, tenant engaging in criminal activity).
The $7.7-billion supports package includes:
	
Health-care funding: $500 million
Emergency Isolation Support: $50 million (one-time payment $1,146)
Community and Social Services funding: $60 million total
		
Adult homeless shelters: $25 million
Women’s emergency shelters: $5 million
Community-based organizations: $30 million


Freezing education property taxes: $87 million
Student loan interest waived for six months: $45 million
Employment standards: 14 days of job-protected leave if directed to self-isolate
Two-month extension of driver’s licence, vehicle registration and ID card expiry date: up to $60 million
Alberta student loan deferral: $148 million
90-day utility deferral program
ATB Financial customer relief program: total loans to consumers and businesses that qualified for deferrals – $3.6 billion to date
Government to pay 50 per cent of WCB premiums for small and medium-sized businesses: $350 million
Six-month education property tax deferral for businesses: $458 million
Government to pay Alberta Energy Regulator industry levy for six months: $113 million
Corporate income tax payment deferral to Aug. 31 interest-free: $1.5 billion
Workers’ Compensation Board premium payment deferral: $750 million
Extensions for oil and gas tenures extending the term of mineral agreements expiring in 2020 by one year
Two-month extension of filing deadline for annual returns with Alberta Corporate Registry: up to $6.3 million
Defer tourism levy for hotels and other lodging providers until Aug. 31: Frees up more than $5 million for employers



Alberta has a comprehensive response to COVID-19 including measures to enhance social distancing, screening and testing. Financial supports are helping Alberta families and businesses.

This will free up more than $5 million in additional cash flow for employers – money that can be used to retain staff, maintain operations and continue providing a valuable service.


“We know Alberta’s tourism industry has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a necessary addition to other recently announced measures. We will continue to support Albertans and Alberta businesses during this tumultuous time, and will continue to evaluate and expand our efforts where possible.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

Hotels and other lodging providers are still expected to file returns, as required by legislation, and must continue to collect the tourism levy from guests staying at their properties during this period. Payments deferred until Aug. 31 will not be subject to penalties or interest.

“This is a welcome move by the government during the unprecedented pressures the hotel and lodging industry is facing due to COVID-19. Deferring the tourism levy will create critical cash flow for operators at a time when they need it most.”
Dave Kaiser, president and CEO, Alberta Hotel and Lodging Association

This measure is in addition to other recently announced supports for Alberta businesses, which are facing unprecedented pressures as a result of the severe economic challenges spurred by the COVID-19 outbreak and current oil price shock.
Additional measures to assist Alberta employers

The collection of corporate income tax balances and instalment payments is deferred until Aug. 31. This gives Alberta businesses access to about $1.5 billion in funds to help them cope with the COVID-19 crisis.
Education property tax amounts are frozen at 2019 levels, saving Alberta households and businesses about $87 million in 2020-21.
Education property tax payments by businesses are deferred for six months, leaving $458 million with job creators to help them pay employees and continue operations.
Private-sector employers can defer paying Workers’ Compensation Board premiums until 2021, with a rebate eligible for those who have already paid their 2020 WCB premiums. Government will pay 50 per cent of 2020 WCB premiums for small and medium businesses.
Utility payments for residential, farm and small commercial customers can be deferred for the next 90 days to ensure no one is cut off from electricity and natural gas services during this time of crisis.

Companies that propose oil, gas, mining, forestry or similar projects that could disturb Crown land are responsible for managing consultation with affected Indigenous communities. The Government of Alberta’s Aboriginal Consultation Office ensures each of those consultations meets provincial requirements.
To be sure Indigenous communities have the capacity to continue this work during the COVID-19 pandemic, Aboriginal Consultation Office staff will reach out to community contacts where states of local emergency have been declared.

“The Government of Alberta’s first priority during the COVID-19 crisis is ensuring public health and safety. We will consider consultation timeline pauses on a case-by-case basis for Indigenous communities that request it of the Aboriginal Consultation Office. We can practise proven public health measures while keeping much-needed projects moving forward.”
Rick Wilson, Minister of Indigenous Relations

Consultation pauses will last as long as the chief medical officer of health’s recommendation for self-isolation remains in place and may be reassessed after that for an extension.
Visit the Indigenous consultation notices page on alberta.ca to see current consultation pauses.
Quick facts

Twenty-two Indigenous communities have paused consultations as of March 25.
The Government of Alberta uses a consultation pause protocol to support Indigenous communities when necessary. Please see Alberta’s guidelines on consultation with First Nations and Metis Settlements.

In recent weeks, Albertans’ buying patterns have changed, and our food supply chain has responded. Government is in constant contact with industry partners and is monitoring the situation closely and ready to respond.
Although some stores have had temporary shortages of certain items, this does not mean food supplies are running low.
There is no need to stockpile food and supplies. Doing so creates additional unnecessary pressure on the food supply chain, which can put the most vulnerable at risk. Government is working with retailers on supply pressures for high-demand items and monitoring availability in rural, remote and Indigenous communities.

“Food is essential and we are in constant contact with our food suppliers and we will do whatever it takes to keep them open. I want to assure all Albertans that our food supply will remain safe, secure and accessible. Albertans are tough and resilient, and together, we will get through this.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

Government is focused on maintaining our stable food supply system. To date, the focus is on maintaining an open trade relationship between the Canada and the United States for movement of essential goods across the border.
Government is also working with our federal and provincial partners to maintain functioning rail service, ports and commercial trucking systems within Canada and across North America to enable the movement of essential goods.

Enforcement of public health orders
Public health orders will now be enforced by law to protect the health and safety of Albertans. Fines for violating an order have increased to a prescribed fine of $1,000 per occurrence. Courts will also have increased powers to administer fines of up to $100,000 for a first offence and up to $500,000 for a subsequent offence for more serious violations. These new fines will be in force over the coming days.

Public health orders will include mandatory self-isolation for travellers returning from outside of Canada for 14 days, plus an additional 10 days from the onset of any symptoms should they occur, whichever is longer.
This legal requirement also applies to close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as to any individual with COVID-19 symptoms, which consist of a cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose, or sore throat.
Orders regarding restrictions around mass gatherings, public recreational facilities, private entertainment facilities, and visitations to long-term care and other continuing care facilities are also enforceable, along with any future public health orders.

Emergency isolation supports
Emergency isolation supports are now available for Albertans who are self-isolating or who are the sole caregivers for someone in self-isolation, and have no other source of income. Applicants can view eligibility criteria and apply at alberta.ca.
Community and social services
Funding criteria and forms for the emergency funding to charities, non-profits and civil society organizations are now posted online.
The Emergency Financial Assistance web page now includes information on the federal and provincial supports/programs and a link to the COVID-19 page for more information.
Community and Social Services has suspended in-person service delivery in its program offices and Alberta Supports Centres. Albertans should contact 1-877-644-9992 for more information.
Offers of help
The Alberta Emergency Management Agency Unsolicited Offers Program has been set up in response to growing offers of generosity from individuals and organizations to help with the challenges many Albertans are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those wanting to help can go to alberta.ca/COVID19offersprogram for more information.
Quick facts

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately, and staying home and away from others if you are sick.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.

In addition, it is now mandatory for travellers returning from outside of Canada to self-isolate. This legal requirement also applies to close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as to any individual with symptoms, such as a fever, cough, sore throat or runny nose.

“We must do everything we can to protect Albertans through this pandemic. While the vast majority of Albertans are doing their part to flatten the curve by self-isolating, practising physical distancing or helping those who are self-isolating, some are not. Self-isolation orders are not suggestions or guidelines – they are now the law and they must be followed. Anyone putting their families, their neighbours, or other Albertans at risk will face consequences.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Through amendments to the Procedures Regulation under the Provincial Offences Procedures Act, community peace officers, in addition to police, will be able to issue tickets to enforce COVID-19 public health orders. Fines now administered through tickets for violating an order have increased from up to $100 per day to a prescribed fine of $1,000 per occurrence. Courts will also have increased powers to administer fines of up to $100,000 for a first offence and up to $500,000 for a subsequent offence for more serious violations. These new fines will be in force over the coming days.

“The chief medical officer of health has the full cooperation of community peace officers and local policing to ensure Albertans comply with orders. Albertans’ health is and will always be our top priority, and we will use all necessary enforcement measures to ensure Albertans take this situation seriously by self-isolating and limiting mass gatherings.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General

Public health orders subject to fines for violation include:

Any individual who has travelled outside of Canada must go into mandatory self-isolation for 14 days from their return, plus an additional 10 days from the onset of any symptoms should they occur, whichever is longer.
Any individual who exhibits COVID-19 symptoms must self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days from the start of their symptoms, or until the symptoms resolve, whichever is longer. Symptoms include cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose, or a sore throat.
Any individual who has been identified by as a close contact of a person(s) with COVID-19 must go into mandatory self-isolation for 14 days from the date of last having been exposed to COVID-19, plus an additional 10 days from the onset of any symptoms should they occur, whichever is longer.
Mass gatherings must be limited to no more than 50 attendees.
Access to public recreational facilities, private entertainment facilities, bars and nightclubs is prohibited.
Visitation to long-term care and other continuing care facilities is limited to essential visitors only.

The Government of Alberta and Alberta Health Services are working with local enforcement agencies to manage complaints, which can be submitted online.
Industry exemptions to travel restrictions will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis by public health officials. Exemptions will be posted online.
Quick facts

All Albertans have a responsibility to help prevent the spread. Take steps to protect yourself and others:
	
practise social distancing
stay home and away from others if sick or in isolation
practise good hygiene – wash hands often for at least 20 seconds, cover coughs and sneezes, and avoid touching your face
monitor for symptoms, such as cough, fever, fatigue or difficulty breathing


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.

The Government of Alberta recently announced $50 million in financial support for self-isolating Albertans with no other source of income. These temporary funds are part of government’s COVID-19 response to keep Albertans safe during this unprecedented global health crisis.
Eligibility
Working Alberta adults who have experienced total or significant loss of income as a result of having to self-isolate or care for a dependent who is self-isolating can apply for emergency isolation support payments if:

They have been diagnosed with COVID-19.
They are caring for a dependent who is self-isolating.
They have otherwise been directed by health authorities to self-isolate.
They are not receiving compensation from any other source.

The application, along with full eligibility criteria, is available at alberta.ca.
Once their eligibility has been confirmed, Albertans will be asked to create a verified MyAlberta Digital ID, which is required to complete the application. As part of the verification process, information from the applicant’s Alberta driver’s licence or ID card is used to confirm their identity by matching the information on the card to the government’s motor vehicles database. Once their identity is confirmed, Albertans can complete the emergency isolation support application.
Qualifying applicants will receive a one-time payment of $1,146 through Interac e-Transfer.
Quick facts

The Government of Alberta has provided emergency financial assistance to thousands of Albertans in the past, in response to crises and natural disasters such as floods and wildfires.
Albertans who require assistance with the application can call the Service Alberta Contact Centre at 310-4455.
The contact centre is available seven days a week, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Starting in April, the federal government will expand Employment Insurance benefits to provide ongoing support to Canadians who are losing income as a result of self-isolation for COVID-19.
The payment from the Government of Alberta is meant to provide emergency funds until financial supports from the Government of Canada are available.

Eight cases in the South zone
Two cases where the zone is still under investigation


Of these cases, 19 have been hospitalized, seven have been admitted to intensive care units (ICU), and two patients have died.
Up to 28 of these cases may be due to community transmission.
A COVID-19 outbreak was confirmed last night at the McKenzie Towne Continuing Care Centre in Calgary.
	
This has resulted in one death of a resident – the second COVID-19 related death in the province. The individual was a female in her 80s. She developed symptoms on March 22 and died March 23.
One staff member and two other residents have tested positive.
There are 11 other symptomatic residents with tests pending.
The source of the infection is not yet known.


The number of confirmed recovered cases remains at three. A longer-term process for determining timely reporting of recovered cases is underway.
Aggregate data, showing cases by age range and zone, as well as by local geographical areas, is available online at ca/covid19statistics.
All Albertans who have travelled outside of the country, including snowbirds returning home from wintering in the United States and other countries, must go straight home upon returning to Alberta and self-isolate for 14 days.
	
This means not going to the grocery store, not stopping at the kennel to pick up their dog, not dropping their RV off for service or storage, and not having family and friends over to visit or going to visit them while isolated. It means going directly and immediately home, self-isolating for 14 days and monitoring for symptoms.
If symptoms do develop, individuals must self-isolate from all other members of their household for an additional 10 days from the beginning of symptoms or until they are feeling well, whichever takes longer.


People not experiencing symptoms are reminded they can still go outside, but this must be limited to activities such as walks, where the individual remains two metres away from others.
A bonspiel event was held in Edmonton March 11 to 14, during which some physicians were exposed to COVID-19.
	
All attendees have been contacted and are self-isolating.
Twelve of the 47 Alberta health-care workers who attended the event have tested positive for COVID-19.
All of their close contacts from the time they had symptoms, including some patients, are being notified as usual through local public health followup.
Three of the infected individuals are physicians working in Red Deer.
		
From these three cases, although they each worked less than a day while symptomatic, a total of 58 patients and 97 other health-care workers have been or will be contacted as potential close contacts of these three.


All Albertans need to work together to help prevent the spread and overcome COVID-19.

Essential visitors will be restricted to a single individual who can be family, a friend, or a paid companion who provides care and companionship necessary for the well-being of the resident (physical and mental health) and/or a single designated visitor for a person who is dying, as long as only one visitor enters the facility at a time.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The Associate Minister will now be responsible for overseeing Alberta’s electricity sector – in addition to natural gas and petrochemicals.
The effective operation of Alberta’s natural gas and electricity systems is critical for our province’s health-care response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for supporting much-needed economic activity across the province.

“Associate Minister Nally has done an exemplary job of working with Alberta’s natural gas producers to not only sustain but improve the health of this vital sector of our economy. I have no doubt that he will continue this great work as he takes on the electricity portfolio. This change will allow our brilliant Energy Minister Sonya Savage to focus on the unprecedented challenges faced by our province’s largest industry.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“The Government of Alberta remains committed to doing everything in its power to protect the health and financial well-being of Albertans. The natural gas and electricity systems are key to enabling our province’s health-care response to COVID-19 and I look forward to working with industry partners to ensure Albertans can continue to receive safe, reliable and affordable electricity.”
Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity

The Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity will continue to operate within the Ministry of Energy to support Albertans and protect jobs by strengthening the long-term stability of Alberta’s natural gas and electricity systems.
Quick facts

About 26,000 kilometres of transmission lines move electricity from generation stations across Alberta.
Alberta has more than 200,000 kilometres of distribution lines carrying electricity to consumers.
Alberta’s electricity system supports more than 4.3 million Albertans, in addition to businesses and industrial sites.

Latest updates

Cases have been identified in all zones across the province:
	
188 cases in the Calgary zone
68 cases in the Edmonton zone
19 cases in the North zone
17 cases in the Central zone
Eight cases in the South zone


Of these cases, 18 are currently hospitalized, seven have been admitted to intensive care units (ICU), and one patient has died. One case is unknown as the zone is being determined.
The number of confirmed recovered cases remains at three. A longer-term process for determining timely reporting of recovered cases is underway.
Aggregate data, showing cases by age range and zone, as well as by local geographical areas, is available online at alberta.ca/covid19statistics.
Travellers who returned to Alberta after March 12 and have mild symptoms will no longer be tested for COVID-19. Instead, the same advice applied to all Albertans will apply to them – to self-isolate at home and away from others. This change is effective going forward, so anyone who has already been told by Health Link that they will be tested will still get tested.
Testing will be prioritized for the following individuals, if they are symptomatic:
	
People who are hospitalized with respiratory illness.
Residents of continuing care and other similar facilities.
People who returned from travelling abroad between March 8 and 12, before the self-isolation protocols were in place.


Anyone with symptoms who does not fit any of these categories should stay home and self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days from the start of their symptoms, or until symptoms resolve, whichever is longer.
Several people have contacted AHS to offer their help as health-care volunteers. Though the outpouring of support is appreciated, at this time volunteer resources will be reaching out to contact registered volunteers where needed. For more information, Alberta Health Services has guidelines in place online.
A bonspiel event was held in Edmonton March 11 to 14, during which some physicians were exposed to COVID-19. We have determined that 11 of the 47 Alberta health-care workers who attended the event have now tested positive for COVID-19. Many of these are physicians. Some of these individuals worked early last week before notification came through of the case associated with the event, and all contacts are being notified as per usual local public health followup. More information will be communicated as details are confirmed.
People not experiencing symptoms are being reminded that they can and should get outside, keeping in mind the importance of social distancing and restrictions on mass gatherings.
Albertans should consider remaining close to their home communities and avoid driving long distances to participate in outdoor activities, particularly in mountain parks. Many of the services Albertans are used to having, like washrooms, rest stops and restaurants, are closed on Alberta highways, in parks and at tourist attractions.
AHS has launched a new text-based service to give Albertans encouragement and ease feelings of stress or anxiety as they respond to recent challenges. Albertans can text COVID19Hope to 393939. In response, they will receive daily text messages on how to focus on healthy thinking or actions to help them manage their mood.
All Albertans need to work together to overcome COVID-19. Albertans are asked to share acts of kindness they have experienced in their community during this difficult time by using the hashtag #AlbertaCares.
To reinforce this message, government has released a video to encourage people to help prevent the spread.

WCB premium payment deferral
Small, medium and large private sector employers can defer WCB premiums until early 2021.
Employers who have already paid their WCB premium payment for 2020-21 are eligible for a rebate or credit.
For small and medium businesses, the government will cover 50 per cent of the premium when it is due.

During this pandemic, it is critical for shelter operators and community organizations to create additional space to meet social distancing and isolation guidelines, establish isolation and care centres, provide capacity to rapidly rehouse people and address other emerging needs.

“Our number 1 priority is to ensure the health and safety of all Albertans. I am thankful our homeless-serving agencies are there to help protect our most vulnerable populations. We will continue to support them throughout this challenging time.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Government is working closely with municipalities and homeless shelters across the province to create more capacity and to meet local needs.

“Our government is taking COVID-19 seriously and we will do whatever it takes to protect the health and safety of all Albertans. We are working quickly to help municipalities and homeless-serving agencies respond to this pandemic to protect the health and safety of vulnerable Albertans and staff.”
Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services

AHS is providing training to help shelter and isolation centre staff screen individuals. To date, there have been no cases of COVID-19 reported at homeless shelters.

The government has made three significant decisions that will give Albertans and Alberta employers additional supports as they deal with the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

“Our priority is to keep our province strong while we get through these difficult times together. We’re doing everything we can to support Albertans and Alberta employers through this crisis. That’s why we’re focused on creating tangible savings for households and freeing up necessary cash for businesses to help them through these unprecedented times.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Education property tax freeze
During a pandemic, Alberta households should not need to worry about paying additional property taxes.

The government will immediately cancel the decision made in Budget 2020 and will freeze education property taxes at last year’s level.
Reversing the 3.4 per cent population and inflation adjustment will save Alberta households and businesses about $87 million in 2020-21, which means $55 million for households and $32 million for employers.
The government expects that Albertans and Alberta businesses will fully realize these savings and that municipal property tax levels will not be increased as a result of the lower provincial education property tax levels.

Education property tax deferral for business
When Alberta businesses are operating, they employ Albertans who can support themselves, their families and help keep the economy running. Effective immediately, the government will defer education property tax for businesses for six months.

In the next six months, $458 million in cash will remain with employers to help them pay employees and continue operations.
The government expects municipalities to set education property tax rates as they normally would, but defer collection. Deferred amounts will be repaid in future tax years.
The government encourages commercial landlords to pass on these savings to their tenants through reduced or deferred payments. This will help employers continue to manage their debts, pay their employees and stay in business.
Businesses capable of paying their taxes in full are strongly encouraged to do so. This will assist the province in being able to support Albertans through this pandemic.


“Eliminating the scheduled adjustment of education property taxes and deferring collection of non-residential property taxes will result in savings to Albertans and improved business cash flow. This measure will help Alberta households and businesses during this time – we want to keep Albertans working while we get through these difficult times together.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

WCB premiums deferral for private sector businesses and support for small and medium businesses
Private sector employers can save money on their WCB premium payments at a time when they need it most. These actions ensure the sustainability of the workers’ compensation system and that injured workers continue to receive the benefits and supports they need to return to work.

Private sector employers will have immediate financial relief by deferring WCB premiums until early 2021, effectively for one year.
Employers who have already paid their WCB premium payment for 2020 are eligible for a rebate or credit.
For small and medium businesses, the government will cover 50 per cent of the premium when it is due.
Large employers will also receive a break by having their 2020 WCB premium payments deferred until 2021, at which time their premiums will be due.
Paying 50 per cent of small and medium private sector WCB premiums for 2020 will cost government approximately $350 million.

Additional measures to help families, students and employers
Previously announced measure taken by the province to protect Albertans and assist businesses include:

The collection of corporate income tax balances and instalment payments is deferred until Aug. 31, 2020. This gives Alberta businesses access to about $1.5 billion in funds to help them cope with the COVID-19 crisis.
$50 million to support emergency isolation for working adult Albertans who must self-isolate, including persons who are the sole caregiver for a dependent who must self-isolate, and who will not have another source of pay or compensation while they are self-isolated. It is distributed in one payment instalment to bridge the gap until the federal emergency payments begin in April.
Utility payment deferral for residential, farm, and small commercial customers to defer bill payments for the next 90 days and ensure no one is cut off from electricity and natural gas services during this time of crisis.
A six-month, interest-free moratorium on Alberta student loan payments for all individuals who are in the process of repaying these loans.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




New temporary physician billing codes are being added to the schedule of medical benefits so that physicians are compensated for providing virtual care.

“We’re helping physicians provide care to Albertans during this critical time while also keeping them as safe as possible. Virtual care codes will facilitate patient care while making it possible to follow public health guidelines of maintaining social distance and self-isolation. Physicians should choose the best way to provide the care Albertans deserve without having to worry about fair compensation for their services.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“These new virtual care codes will make it possible for physicians to deliver care safely and effectively to patients during the pandemic. These codes apply not only for COVID-19 care, but for all the physical and mental health needs of patients as they present every day. Delivering virtual care will maintain ongoing physician-patient relationships which are essential for quality care. These codes represent an important step towards ensuring the viability of physicians’ practices, and supporting the thousands of Albertans they employ.”
Dr. Christine P. Molnar, president, Alberta Medical Association

Through these new health service codes, physicians will be paid the same rate as if the medical services were provided face-to-face. This is similar to billing codes established in other provinces, such as Ontario and British Columbia.
Quick facts

The changes will add physician billing codes for patient visits, consultations, and mental health services provided over the phone or through secure video conference.
In-person physician and specialist care will continue. Virtual services will be offered by physicians and specialists where appropriate.
These new temporary virtual codes will not be subject to the daily patient visit cap.
Details of all the changes are communicated in Bulletin 222.
Rates vary depending on physician type and the service provided and are the same as the current in-person rate. For example:

1. Visit services
A limited assessment of a patient provided via telephone or via secure video conference, which includes a history limited to and related to the presenting problem, and an examination, which is limited to relevant body systems, an appropriate record, and advice to the patient. It includes the ordering of appropriate diagnostic tests and procedures, as well as discussion with the patient.

A family physician provides patient care advice via video conference related to anxiety (total duration 20 minutes) – $38.03
An internal medicine specialist completes a visit via telephone to discuss medication management (total duration 20 minutes) – $55.64

2. Consultation services
An in-depth evaluation of a patient with a written report to the referring practitioner (physician, nurse practitioner, etc.) provided via telephone or secure video conference.
This service includes the recording of a complete history, an appropriate record and advice to the patient. It may include the ordering of appropriate diagnostic tests and procedures, as well as discussion with the patient and/or the referring practitioner.

A neurologist completes a comprehensive consultation via video conference for a referred patient - $197.86
A family physician completes a comprehensive consultation via video conference for a referred patient - $124.25
A psychiatrist provides a consultation service - $189.58

3. Mental health services
Psychiatric treatment provided via telephone or secure video conference, including medical psychotherapy and medication prescription, psychiatric reassessment, patient education and/or psychiatric counselling.

A generalist of mental health provides 30 minutes of counselling via telephone to a patient – $88.02
A family physician provides a scheduled 38 minutes of psychotherapy via video conference to a patient – $95.08

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Travellers who returned to Alberta after March 12 and have mild symptoms will no longer be tested for COVID-19. Instead, the same advice applied to all Albertans will apply to them – to self-isolate at home and away from others. This change is effective going forward, so anyone who has already been told by Health Link that they will be tested will still get tested.

“Changing our testing protocols will allow us to focus Alberta’s testing capacity on those most at risk. This is consistent with the approach happening across Canada. It will enable us to strategically use our testing resources. Our new approach reflects the fact that the most important thing anyone can do if they have mild symptoms isn’t to get tested – it’s to stay home and self-isolate.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

Testing will be prioritized for the following individuals, if they are symptomatic:

People who are hospitalized with respiratory illness.
Residents of continuing care and other similar facilities.
People who returned from travelling abroad between March 8 and March 12 (before the self-isolation protocols were in place.
Health-care workers with respiratory symptoms (this testing will begin later this week).

Anyone with symptoms who does not fit any of these categories should stay home and self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days from the start of their symptoms, or until symptoms resolve, whichever is longer.
The online self-assessment tool has been updated to reflect the change in testing for returning travellers.
Alberta Health Services is building extra capacity to be able to provide advice to returning travellers with symptoms, ensuring they are following proper medical directions including staying home and away from others, and monitoring their symptoms. These resources are expected to be in place later this week.

Children’s Services is working with child care providers to open up to 15,000 child care spaces to ensure child care is available for those providing services that Albertans rely on during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“All Albertans are relying on those who are working in core service areas like health care. That’s why we want to make sure child care is available for those who need it during this crisis.”
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services

Child care centres are initially being chosen based on proximity to health-care facilities and will be reopened in a phased approach based on areas of need, starting the week of March 23.

“We are ready and able to contribute to this important effort. We will ensure our staff strictly follow the health guidance we’ve received and parents can rest assured that while they are at work, their kids are safe and cared for.”
Anil Karim, executive director, Kids U

Access will be prioritized to health-care practitioners and critical infrastructure workers. Additional spaces will then be available to first responders (firefighters and police officers) and others.
Parents will be notified this coming week through their employer if they qualify to send their children to newly reopened centres.
Children’s Services is contacting the centres directly. The centres will be limited to 30 people, including staff, and will have to adhere to strict sanitization practices based on specific instructions from the chief medical officer of health and Alberta Health. Parents who qualify for subsidy will receive it and centres will charge their typical rate, within reason.
All other licensed child care centres are to remain closed. As previously stated, approved day homes may remain open but limited to six children, including the operators’ own children.
Finally, as we navigate this pandemic together, the Government of Alberta asks that all Albertans use resources judicially. Parents who are eligible should only access this child care if it is the only way they’ll be able to go to their work in a core service sector.

Made up of 15 influential leaders, the council will advise government on how to best support civil society organizations working on social issues. This includes non-profit, charitable and voluntary groups, as well as social enterprises. In addition to the council’s current task to advise government in supporting vulnerable Albertans during COVID-19, the council will also advise on a range of social issues, such as finding out what the sector needs, current challenges and how best to collaborate.
Jeremy Nixon, MLA for Calgary-Klein, will serve as a council member and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Community and Social Services.

“Alberta has a legacy of communities coming together to solve problems – the most recent example being the way people are helping our most vulnerable during the COVID-19 crisis. This new council will engage directly with local groups and is one of our nine platform commitments to help harness the power of civil society.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Non-profit groups and charities know and understand their communities’ needs. This new council will strengthen the creativity and capacity of civil society in responding to pressing social issues. While our first task will be to respond to COVID-19, our longer term objective will be to enhance vibrancy and longevity in the civil society sector.”  
Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services

COVID-19 response
As charities and non-profits receive $60 million in government emergency funding to help vulnerable Albertans including seniors, people in shelters and others in isolation, the council will consult with the sector to identify what they need to help Albertans quickly and effectively. It will serve as a link with the non-profit sector and provide ongoing advice to the Premier on ways to build sector capacity.
Council members
Council members offer decades of experience to the civil society sector. They bring extensive experience in the areas of philanthropy and fundraising, community development, volunteer sector and social service leadership, social entrepreneurship and more.

“Today, our government reaffirms its commitment to building a province where all people feel safe, welcome, and respected.  
 
“My role as Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women is to inspire Albertans to celebrate our diversity. Our approach to multiculturalism targets the root causes of racism, which are fear and misunderstanding. 
 
“We are working with the Anti-Racism Advisory Council to identify key priorities that are imperative for an inclusive and accepting Alberta. Their advice and wisdom will inform policy work in our government. 
 
“We lead by example and demonstrate the value that multiculturalism brings to our province by celebrating vibrant cultural events, such as Diwali, Lunar New Year and Black History Month. We are proud to recognize and share our cultural traditions. Sharing and learning about our different cultural traditions, food, music and dance leads to deeper understanding and stronger relationships. 
 
“These next few months will challenge us to connect through different mediums as we live through COVID-19. 
 
Renée Vaugeois, executive director of the John Humphrey Centre for Human Rights, added: 
 
“We are facing incredibly difficult times in Alberta and across the country. Nothing feels certain. It is at times like these, however, that racism and discrimination can intensify and fear can grab hold. 
 
“On this International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, let us remember that we are all connected and that it is only through working together, across our differences, that we can overcome the adversities that face us collectively.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




As part of the government’s actions to respond to COVID-19 and keep Albertans safe during this global public health emergency, government made amendments to the Emergency Management Act.
Prior to the amendment, a provincial state of emergency nullified a local state of emergency, taking some powers away from the local officials. Under the new act, a provincial state of emergency can now supplement and reinforce a local authority’s state of emergency, allowing both levels of government to work more closely.

“These are truly unprecedented times, and the safety of all Albertans remains our top priority. These changes will allow us to better support and work alongside our communities across the province in order to manage emergencies more effectively.”
Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs

The amendments provide clarity and improve the coordination of local and provincial response efforts in the event of disasters, such as wildfires, floods and pandemics. They also clarify emergency management responsibilities and ensure that local authorities can remain responsible for their communities in the event of a provincial state of emergency.
As of March 20, there have been 25 local states of emergency declared in Alberta as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rise.
In order for municipalities to deal effectively with their individual situations, they need the power as a local authority to direct and control their own response efforts, as well as work with the province. Alberta is in disaster season, and allowing individual communities to run their own state of local emergency will ensure the province is ready and able to respond to additional emergencies and disasters should they arise.
The Emergency Management Act is separate and distinct from the Public Health Act, under which a Public Health Emergency has been declared in order to deal with the health impacts of the COVID19 pandemic.
Quick facts
The Emergency Management Act:

Outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, the provincial government and local authorities.
Provides the legislative framework for local and provincial management of emergencies and disasters, such as wildfires and floods.
Provides the authority to grant additional powers during a provincial state of emergency or a state of local emergency.
Governs the coming into force, expiration, and termination of these states of emergency.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




In the face of challenges resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak and declining oil prices due to an international price war, government is taking the first step in implementing a series of energy sector initiatives aimed at enhancing immediate liquidity – and longer-term certainty – of energy companies.
Alberta’s energy sector supports more than 500,000 jobs across Canada. These jobs are currently at risk and government must act to do everything it can to ensure energy sector firms remain operating and employing Albertans.

“In order to keep Albertans employed, our government is taking immediate action to help our energy sector get through these difficult times. By providing industry with more options, in the short-term they are able to maintain operations and protect jobs.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy


“These are incredibly challenging times for Albertans and for the energy sector. These steps will provide the province’s oil and gas producers with additional flexibility, increasing their ability to protect their workforce.”
Gary G. Mar, president & CEO, Petroleum Services Association of Canada

Immediate relief for the energy sector
These actions are the first step in providing short and long-term financial relief to the oil and gas industry.

Funding the Alberta Energy Regulator levy: $113 million
	
Government is funding the industry levy for the Alberta Energy Regulator for a period of six months, achieving $113 million in industry relief.




Granting extensions for oil and gas tenures
	
Extending the term of mineral agreements expiring in 2020 by one year provides increased certainty for industry by allowing additional time to raise capital and plan future activities. 



The Government of Alberta has extended a loan to the Orphan Well Association in the amount of $100 million. This loan will bolster the association’s immediate reclamation efforts, decommission about 1,000 wells, and start more than 1,000 environmental assessments, creating up to 500 direct and indirect jobs.
In addition to these actions, government continues to cut unnecessary red tape to reduce the burden of doing business.
These efforts build on the Government of Alberta’s comprehensive response to protect Albertans through a global public health emergency. Measures have been introduced to protect Alberta families, including $50 million in immediate emergency isolation supports and an additional $500 million focused on supporting front-line health-care workers.

Government has worked with the Alberta School Boards Association, the College of Alberta School Superintendents, the Alberta Teachers’ Association and the Association of Independent Schools & Colleges of Alberta to identify how to continue teacher-directed learning for students across Alberta.
This approach was developed with a focus on the safety of our staff and students, ensuring resources continue to flow to the education system and providing boards with the flexibility required to meet the unique needs of their students.

“I want to thank every Albertan involved in our province’s education system. Everyone has come together to chart a path forward as part of our COVID-19 response – teachers, support staff, superintendents, administrators, elected trustees, parents, education associations, the provincial government and many others. It is important that Albertans know that we are all working towards the same goal – to provide the best possible learning situation for our students during this very challenging and unprecedented time.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

Continuity of student learning and content delivery
For all kindergarten to Grade 12 students, school authorities will offer at-home learning opportunities, either through online means or through other accommodations, such as course packages and telephone check-ins. Government expects that every student, regardless of their geographic location or socioeconomic status, will continue to learn while in-school classes across the province are cancelled. This includes students in public, separate, Francophone, charter and independent schools, and Indigenous students attending provincial schools.
To identify what content needs to be delivered, teachers will evaluate curricular outcomes that have not yet been covered, prioritize remaining outcomes based on what is manageable for students working from home, and will plan specific tasks and projects for students.
Content delivery for each grade is broken down as follows:
Kindergarten – Grade 3

Education content will focus on language/literacy and mathematics/numeracy outcomes of the provincial curriculum.
Teachers will assign an average of five hours of work per student per week, and will be expected to work with their students and parents on the delivery of these materials.

Grades 4-6

Education content will continue to focus on language/literacy and mathematics/numeracy outcomes, and there will be opportunity to incorporate science and social studies outcomes through cross-curricular learning.
Teachers will assign an average of five hours of work per student per week, and will be expected to work with their students and parents on the delivery of these materials.

Grades 7-9

Education content will focus on core mathematics, language/literacy, science and social studies curriculum outcomes.
Teachers will assign an average of 10 hours of work per student per week, and will be expected to work with their students and parents on the delivery of these materials.

Grades 10-12

Education content will focus on specified and core courses required for high school graduation requirements, including language (English, French and French language arts), social studies, mathematics, biology, chemistry and physics.
Content from other courses will be delivered where possible, and accommodations for students unable to complete courses are in place.
Teachers will assign an average of 3 hours of work per course per week, and will be expected to work with their students and parents on the delivery of these materials.

Grade progression and report cards
Every student will receive final grades and will receive a report card, appropriate to their grade level. Teachers will be responsible for assessing a student’s progress and assigning a final grade. School authorities have committed to ensuring parents are consulted and kept informed of how assessment will be determined in this unique circumstance. All students who were on track to progress to the next grade will.
Where possible, schools will work with high school students to complete their courses to the best of their ability, providing a final mark and awarding credits. If a student is unable to complete a course that would have allowed them to progress to the next grade, principals have the ability to award credits to ensure student progression.
High school diploma criteria
Students on track to receive 100 or more credits will still be eligible to graduate and receive a high school diploma. Principals have the ability to award up to 15 credits to students in Grade 12 whose program has been negatively impacted by class cancellations. For any courses that are started, schools will complete them with the student to the best of their ability, provide a final mark and award credits.
If the student is unable to complete a course that would have led them to achieving a high school diploma, such as a work experience or a career and technology studies course, principals have the ability to award credits to ensure the student graduates.
Provincial assessments
All Grade 6 and 9 provincial achievement tests and Grade 12 diploma exams are cancelled. Under special circumstances, students can request to write a diploma exam. Students wishing to do so should speak to their teacher and school administrator.
Resources for parents
Parents may want to supplement student learning by providing their children with additional resources. The following provincial resources are available to parents:

LearnAlberta.ca: more than 4,000 digital resources aligned with Alberta’s K-12 curriculum.


My Child’s Learning: A Parent Resource: provides parents with information specific to each grade level.

Additionally, many Alberta school authorities have a variety of resources available to support parents and students in learning at home. The following list provides a sample of what is available:

Aspen View Public Schools: Educational Supports for Families provides a series of resources, many of which are publicly available to support literacy and numeracy.
Calgary Board of Education: Learning at Home provides a number of supports for kindergarten to Grade 12.
Clearview Public Schools: Student Resources provides resources for study skills and useful learning sites.
Edmonton Catholic Schools: Parent Resources provides links to a wide variety of informational resources.
Edmonton Public Schools: Activities for Parents provides a number of activities that can be done at home for kindergarten to Grade 12.
Foothills School Division: Parent Learning Link provides a number of resources to support parents.
Greater St. Albert Catholic Schools: Parent Resources link provides a number of resources to support parents.
Northwest Francophone Education Region: Liens Utiles provides a number of resources to support parents.
Southern Francophone Education Region: Ressources et Liens Utiles provides a number of resources to support parents.

Funding continues to flow to school authorities for the remainder of the 2019/20 school year. This will help school authorities deliver at-home learning to their students.
“The Alberta School Boards Association appreciates that government has given us the opportunity to provide input on the continuing student learning plan. In this unprecedented time, school boards appreciate the flexibility and clarity as they make decisions that put students first and meet the diverse needs of their communities.”
Lorrie Jess, president, Alberta School Boards Association

“We’ve seen teachers across the province stepping up in a variety of ways to ensure students feel supported during these unprecedented times. This continuity plan is a great start for providing guidance and consistency for school boards and teachers to make sure learning continues and stability is provided for students. We look forward to continue working with government and key stakeholders on an operations plan.”
Jason Schilling, president, Alberta Teachers’ Association


“The College of Alberta School Superintendents supports the guidelines developed through collaboration of education partners and the ministry. While providing a framework for continuity of learning by all students, the guidelines provide the flexibility required for teachers, principals and superintendents to ensure every student in the province has an opportunity to continue to learn. The ministry’s willingness to be inclusive of all education partners to respond to this unprecedented circumstance is why Alberta students have and will continue to achieve at the highest level in the world.”
Bevan Daverne, president, College of Alberta School Superintendents


“The Association of Independent Schools and Colleges in Alberta appreciates the opportunity to collaborate and provide input into the continuing learning student plan. Having a benchmark for content delivery will provide some clarity to students and parents, while still allowing schools and teachers to further enrich the learning as appropriate to their local context.”
Simon Williams, president, Association of Independent Schools and Colleges of Alberta

Latest updates

27 additional cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Alberta, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 146.
Cases have been identified in all zones across the province:
	
101 cases in the Calgary zone
29 cases in the Edmonton zone
10 cases in the North zone
Three cases in the Central zone
Three cases in the South zone




Of these cases, five are currently hospitalized, two admitted to intensive care units (ICU), and one patient has died.
The individual was a male in his 60’s who had been admitted to ICU in the Edmonton zone on March 12 and had pre-existing conditions. This is the first confirmed COVID-19 related death in the province.
Aggregate data, showing cases by age range and zone, as well as by local geographical areas, is available online at alberta.ca/covid19statistics. This site had 1,276 visits in its first 24 hours.
Pharmacists have been working hard to help Albertans assess and screen for COVID-19. A new billing code has been created for this service.
To ensure Albertans continue to have access to essential medications and to help pharmacists address situations where some individuals are attempting to stockpile medication, we are recommending pharmacies have the discretion to provide a maximum 30-day supply of prescription drugs.
	
Some Albertans may need to refill their prescriptions more frequently than usual. They should speak with their pharmacist for advice on when it is appropriate to fill their prescriptions.  
To assist with the added associated costs, those with Alberta government-sponsored Coverage for Seniors and Non-Group Coverage will pay a lower copayment of up to $8 per prescription for a 30-day supply. The current copayment is up to $25 per prescription.  Albertans with other coverage should consult with their benefits provider.


Currently, there is no strong evidence to indicate ibuprofen could make COVID-19 symptoms worse beyond the usual known side-effects that limit the use of ibuprofen in certain populations. Albertans should consult with a doctor about what is best for them.
Albertans can now meet with Alberta-licensed physicians through their smartphone, thanks to an initiative by TELUS Health. Find more information and download the app here.
Social distancing measures continue to be an important way to minimize the spread of COVID-19. A tip sheet is available to help Albertans understand ways to minimize close contact with others in community settings.
Mass gathering limitations and restrictions around public recreation and private entertainment facilities remain in place across the province.

Emergency isolation support
$50 million is being made available for Albertans who must self-isolate and do not have another source of pay or compensation while they are self-isolated.
A one-time payment of $1,146 will be distributed to bridge the gap until the federal emergency payments begin in April.
Applications for emergency isolation support will be available on Alberta.ca next week.
Student loans and apprenticeship training
Government will implement a six-month, interest-free moratorium on student loan payments for all individuals who are in the process of repaying these loans.
The March-April and May-June intakes for apprenticeship training are cancelled.
Apprenticeship students who started classroom instruction on or after March 2 should discuss tuition refund options with institutions, and will receive priority for fall intake. Apprenticeship students who started classroom instruction before March 2 will be advised by their institution about next steps for distance learning options, assessments and completion.
Information for travellers
Travel outside the country is strongly discouraged. Given the rapid global spread of the virus, it is no longer possible to assess health risks for the duration of the trip.
Any traveller returning from outside of the country should self-isolate for 14 days, even if they are feeling well, and monitor for symptoms.
Any traveller who has returned before March 12 should closely monitor themselves for symptoms. If they experience symptoms, they should self-isolate immediately and call Health Link 811 for follow-up assessment and testing.
The Alberta government and Travel Alberta have launched a campaign to inform Canadians travelling in the United States and Mexico about the importance of returning home.
COVID-19 related information has been provided for departing and returning passengers at the international airports in both Edmonton and Calgary. This information has also been shared with all airports in Alberta and several airlines.
Quick facts

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately, and staying home and away from others if you are sick.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




ASIRT’s investigation was comprehensive and thorough, and conducted using current investigative protocols. ASIRT interviewed all relevant police and civilian witnesses. Radio communications recordings and computer aided dispatch (CAD) records were seized. The involved officer voluntarily provided a statement. Investigators canvassed the area, but were unable to locate a CCTV video record of any portion of the incident. EPS vehicles are not equipped with in-car cameras, nor do EPS officers wear body-worn cameras.
Between March 25 and 27, 2017, police repeatedly received information that suggested the 34-year-old man was in possession of firearms and that he was willing to use those firearms against police. The information suggested the source(s) had some knowledge of the man and his circumstances. Some of the information was demonstrably reliable while the remainder of the information required further investigation.
A review of the man’s history revealed that in October 2016, he was reported to have brandished a handgun and threatened a female acquaintance with it. In November 2016, he was stopped in a vehicle containing a pellet gun, mask, radios, cocaine and methamphetamine. On Dec. 20, 2016, the man was arrested and charged with – among multiple other offences – firearm offences, including possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm with ammunition readily available, and possession of a firearm in a motor vehicle. The man was on release for offences related to all of these offences at the time of the critical incident, and bound by bail conditions, including a curfew.
Based on the received information, EPS members began surveillance on the evening of March 27, 2017. They observed the man engaging in conduct that violated his bail conditions. For safety reasons, police decided to do additional surveillance to better assess the risk. On March 28, 2017, officers conducted a curfew check at the man’s residence, but were advised by another resident that the man was not home. A check at the residence of the man’s common-law spouse also failed to locate him. One of the officers gave the man’s spouse a business card, along with a request for the man to call. On March 30, 2017, the man contacted the officer, who advised the man that he had an outstanding warrant and was also in violation of his bail conditions. The man seemed willing to voluntarily surrender and address the matters. The officer indicated he would find out what was happening regarding the violation of bail conditions and call him back.
It was decided that an appropriate and safe approach would be to have the man voluntarily surrender to be arrested in relation to the outstanding warrant and breach of bail conditions. Following the arrest, investigators would attempt to interview the man regarding the allegations of firearms possession and possible threats. Having set up surveillance, the officer who had spoken to him earlier called the man back at approximately 6 p.m. to advise him of his outstanding issues, inform him that he would be subject to an arrest, and discuss surrender. The officer advised the man that he would be taken into custody and that he would have a bail hearing. The man indicated that he wanted to speak to counsel and was advised that he would have an opportunity to contact counsel following his arrest. The man became increasingly agitated and argumentative on the phone, clearly reconsidering whether he would surrender voluntarily. He advised he would speak to his lawyer and hung up saying, “Peace, I’m out.”
The surveillance team was advised that the man would not be turning himself in. Immediately thereafter, the man left the residence carrying a black bag, in the company of another man. Both men seemed to scan the area as they moved towards parking stalls north of the residence. The man entered the driver’s seat of a nearby Chevrolet Impala while the other person entered the passenger side. It became apparent that the man, as well as those associated with him, both in the vehicle and back at residence, were looking for police. As the registered owner was not in the vehicle, by entering the vehicle, the man violated another one of his bail conditions. When the man drove out of the parking lot, officers tried to follow, but the man performed a U-turn on 50 Street at 130 Avenue to avoid a red light, and lost police at approximately 53 Street and 130 Avenue. Moments later, the Impala was found abandoned at 129 Avenue and 54 Street. Officers fanned out in the area looking for the man, who they now believed to be on foot. At about 6:20 p.m., an officer found the man alone and on foot at approximately 128 Avenue and 52 Street.
Only a handful of individuals were present at the time of the final encounter and the officer-involved shooting. Besides the involved officer and the man, another officer had arrived on scene. Additionally, two civilian witnesses were driving in the area when they came upon the incident and made certain observations. Lastly, two additional civilian witnesses observed elements of what occurred shortly before the officer fired his service weapon, although they did not witness the shooting itself.
The accounts of all the independent witnesses and the officers agree that the man appeared to be arguing with the involved officer, who was in plainclothes and not identifiable to the independent witnesses as a police officer. To them, it looked like a conflict between two individuals – one (i.e., the officer) associated with a vehicle and the other standing on a dirt/grass area a short distance away. The men appeared to be yelling at each other but none of the witnesses could hear what was being said. With the exception of the version provided by the man himself, all witnesses, including the independent witnesses, agreed that the man was not surrendering but rather yelling, “acting tough,” jumping up and down and waving his arms. One witness compared the man’s behaviour to a temper tantrum. The civilian witnesses all agree that they did not see the man advance on the plainclothes officer, something that is not in dispute. The issue in this case was never whether the man came close enough to the officer to physically engage, but whether the man was potentially armed with a firearm, a risk that the civilian witnesses would have been unaware of.
Now aware that police were looking for the man, the officer indicated that he had concerns about public safety, given his belief that the man might be armed, and felt he needed to make an arrest before the man made it to a more populated area. The officer yelled commands to the man, indicating that he was under arrest and to get down on the ground, commands which he described as being ignored.
As the officer confronted the man, he indicated that the man’s hand went into the pocket of his sweatpants and that he appeared to be pulling a dark item that was black and had a straight edge that resembled, to him, the receiver of a pistol. Feeling that both his and the second officer’s lives were at risk, given the man’s history and the recent police intelligence, the officer fired his pistol, whereupon the man’s hand came flying out of his pocket and the man spun onto the ground. From her vantage point, the second officer saw the man bring his hands down near his waistband, at which point the other officer fired. A black cellphone was located near the man’s head immediately following the shooting.
In this case, it is beyond dispute that the man was ultimately determined to have been unarmed. From a general standpoint, the shooting of an unarmed man is troubling and requires careful scrutiny. Both the circumstances and the law must be carefully considered.
As one might expect, there are inconsistent accounts from the various witnesses. Eyewitness evidence has well-recognized frailties and can be susceptible to inaccuracies based on honest but mistaken perceptions. In addition to honest but mistaken perceptions, not all witnesses are reliable and/or credible and one has to be alive to the potential for a witness to deliberately lie, misrepresent or colour their evidence to place themselves and/or their conduct in a better light. Given that, regardless of their character or criminal history, a person can be honest and still be wrong about something they perceived and one should be cautious about finding deliberate dishonesty unless it is the only available interpretation. Where deliberate dishonesty can be demonstrated, however, that can influence how a particular witness’s evidence is assessed as a whole.
The reliability of the man’s formal statement to investigators was questionable. It was inconsistent with brief descriptions he had given to investigators in the hospital and it was internally inconsistent in multiple respects. The man maintained that he was unaware that the involved officer was a police officer but then indicated that he had complied, had not resisted and suggested that he was not a stupid person and would follow the instructions of a police officer since he had family involved in corrections and law enforcement. While the man’s ability to recall the events may have been negatively impacted by his injury and subsequent hospitalization, some aspects of his statement were incorrect and, in some respects, demonstrably, unequivocally false.
Under Sec. 25 of the Criminal Code, an officer is entitled to use as much force as is reasonably necessary in the lawful execution of his or her duties. An officer is only entitled to use as much force as is reasonably necessary to affect his or her lawful purpose; excessive force is not protected under Sec. 25 of the Criminal Code. Under Sec. 34 of the Criminal Code, any person, including a police officer, is entitled to the use of reasonable force in defence of themselves or another person.
Courts have provided a number of principles to assist in the assessment of the lawfulness of a police officer’s use of force. The starting point is that if a peace officer acts on reasonable and probable grounds, he or she can use as much force as is necessary to effect an arrest; however, if he or she uses more force than necessary, the protections under Sec. 25 of the Criminal Code are lost. A peace officer cannot use force that is intended to cause or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless he believes it is necessary for the purpose of preserving himself or anyone under his protection from death or grievous bodily harm.
In weighing the amount of force used, one must consider what the officer would have known or may have reasonably believed at the time the force was used, not what might have been determined after the fact. Furthermore, an officer is not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude or “to a nicety.” Detached reflection cannot be demanded in exigent circumstances. It is the reasonable belief of the police officer in light of all the circumstances that is important.
Sections 25 and 27 of the Criminal Code require that the force used be no more than what is reasonably necessary. Some allowance must be made for an officer, in the exigencies of the moment, misjudging the degree of force necessary.
There is an inherent challenge in assessing the use of potentially lethal force in the face of evidence that establishes, after the fact, that the person was not armed. If one had the benefit of knowing the person was unarmed, it would be easy to agree that when the confrontation occurred, the person would likely not present a risk of grievous bodily harm or death to the police officer or anyone under his protection. That is not, however, the lens through which the officer’s conduct must be assessed. The issue is not whether the officer was correct in his belief that the man might have been reaching for a firearm. The issue is whether the officer reasonably believed that the man could be in possession of a firearm, based on the information available at the time, and that discharging his firearm was necessary to protect himself and/or another person from grievous bodily harm or death.
A person’s criminal history and prior character has limited relevance in any particular investigation. It can, however, be relevant to inform the assessment of the risk that person might present to the safety of police and the general public, but generally only in circumstances where the officer(s) know who the person is when an encounter occurs. If officers are unaware of who they are dealing with, it plays no role in the perception of risk. In this case, EPS officers, including the involved officer, were fully aware of the man’s identity and his background at the time of the officer involved shooting and the knowledge of the man’s background was relevant to any subjective and objective reasonable assessment of risk.
In this case, the evidence established that immediately prior to the confrontation, police had received information that included a belief that the man was in possession of firearms that he was willing to use, including against police officers. Other aspects of the information that had been provided could be considered reliable, which would have supported an inference that it was possible that the information regarding the man carrying firearms and his preparedness to use them might also be reliable.
Checks into the man’s background provided information that would support an inference that he may currently be or may have been involved in the drug trade. It would also be fair to state that the possession and use of firearms can be associated with involvement in the drug trade.
These checks also provided information to officers that, in the preceding four and a half months, the man had been charged with offences relating to the possession and use of firearms:

The man had been in possession of a firearm on Oct. 26, 2016, and allegedly threatened a woman with it.
The man had been in a vehicle that contained a pellet gun on Nov. 24, 2016, and had been in possession of controlled substances, in addition to other items.
The man had been found in possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm with readily accessible ammunition, in a motor vehicle, on Dece. 20, 2016. Further, he had been found, again, in possession of a controlled substance.

While the information was dated, the man nevertheless had a criminal record for violence, including assault with a weapon.
While the man had initially appeared compliant when contacted by police about an outstanding warrant and the breaches of recognizance, he became difficult and uncooperative, choosing not to surrender voluntarily, and his conduct immediately after that call could reasonably be inferred to be an attempt to flee to avoid arrest. He appeared to be actively looking for police in the area. These observations were corroborated by the man’s own admission of having seen multiple officers in unmarked vehicles.
While the information was incomplete, without additional time and resources to further investigate, it painted a picture that would have reasonably supported a belief that the man could be in possession of a firearm(s) and/or explosive device, and could present a risk to police and public safety.
The involved officer provided evidence that, contrary to his verbal commands, the man lowered his arm down to his pants pocket and began to remove something that was black with a straight edge that he believed was consistent with a handgun. This officer’s evidence was corroborated by the evidence of the second officer who arrived and recounted her observations that the man brought his hand down to the area of his waistband. Lastly, while the man denied that he grabbed anything from his pants pocket, on his own evidence, the man confirmed that he brought his hand(s) down. The recovery of the cellphone from the ground where he fell contradicted the man’s version of events.
In the circumstances, based on the information available at the time, the officer’s belief that the man might be in possession of a firearm(s) was reasonable. When he responded negatively to directions, became involved in a yelling match with the officers and brought his hand(s) down towards his waistband/pocket – even on his own evidence – it was not unreasonable, in all the circumstances, to believe that he might be reaching for a firearm.
Nothing in his conduct would have conveyed cooperation or compliance. The officer was required to make a split-second decision. A police officer does not have to wait to be fired upon to respond. If an officer reasonably believes that a person presents an imminent risk of grievous bodily harm or death, he or she is authorized to use lethal force.
Conclusion
Having carefully reviewed the evidence, it is the conclusion of executive director Susan Hughson, Q.C., that the officer had objectively reasonable grounds to believe that the man might be armed. Further, it was objectively reasonable to believe, based on the information available at that time, that when he lowered his arm(s) and placed his hand(s) in or near his pockets in apparent contravention of very clear commands, the man might be reaching for a firearm and that he presented a risk of death or grievous bodily harm to the officer. As such, the officer’s use of force was justified and reasonable pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code. There are no reasonable grounds to believe that the officer committed any Criminal Code offence(s).

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

This new pharmacy service provides Albertans with another way to access information and advice about COVID-19.

“We need to maximize the capabilities of our health professionals at this time. Pharmacists have knowledge and experience in infectious diseases such as influenza and in helping Albertans with their questions and concerns. This measure acknowledges pharmacists’ role in the health system and in supporting patients.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The service is initially limited to screening and the provision of information about COVID-19. Alberta Health and the Alberta Pharmacists’ Association will remain in close collaboration on how to expand this role, should this be needed. This could include direct referral for COVID-19 testing and supporting Health Link 811 in addressing Albertans’ information needs.

“We commend the quick action and responsiveness of Alberta Health to establish a compensation structure to support the care that Alberta’s community pharmacists are providing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacists play an essential role in the management, assessment, and screening of patient health indicators and helping patients understand their COVID-19 risk is an important support for Albertans.”
Margaret Wing, CEO, Alberta Pharmacists’ Association

In addition, to ensure Albertans have continued access to essential medications and help pharmacists manage drug supplies, the Alberta government is recommending that pharmacies have the discretion to provide a maximum 30-day supply of prescription drugs.

“Albertans rely on their pharmacy teams for access to medications to manage their health needs. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in drug shortages due to global demand. To ensure Albertans can access the medications they need, the Alberta College of Pharmacy supports measures that will reduce the likelihood of drug shortages by limiting prescription quantities to 30 days. This will assist in stabilizing our drug supply.”
Greg Eberhart, Registrar, Alberta College of Pharmacy

Because some Albertans will need to refill their prescriptions more often than usual, they should speak with their pharmacist about when it is appropriate to do so. 
To assist with the added cost, those with Alberta government-sponsored Coverage for Seniors and Non-Group coverage programs will pay a lower co-payment of up to $8 per prescription for a 30-day supply. The current co-payment is up to $25 per prescription. Albertans with other coverage should consult with their benefits provider.

“The changes announced today to limit prescription quantities to 30 days will help to ensure that Alberta pharmacists have the means to effectively manage the supply of medications to the benefit of all their patients. Pharmacists are working tirelessly to ensure that patients continue to have access to prescription medications and this change should help to ease that pressure.”
Margaret Wing, CEO, Alberta Pharmacists’ Association

Other provinces, including Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, have either taken action or are in the process of implementing measures to protect drug supply chain stability.

Babylon by TELUS Health is a service already available in British Columbia via a free downloadable app. The app can serve as a new tool for Albertans to access health-care information and support in response to COVID-19 – from anywhere in the province. Albertans can use the service to check symptoms, book appointments, see a doctor, and get prescriptions and referrals for diagnostic imaging and specialists – all covered by Alberta Health Care. 

“Alberta is pleased to partner with TELUS to deliver physician services in a new way. This app is now available and ready for use in Alberta thanks to an alternative relationship plan, and it comes at a time when our health system is actively asking people to self-isolate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using this app is an alternative to visiting physicians face-to-face when you’re not sure if your symptoms are related to the novel coronavirus or at any other time.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“TELUS’ passionate and skilled health-care team is committed to driving improved health outcomes for Albertans by bringing our Babylon by TELUS Health virtual care service to communities and families across the entire province. In partnership with the Government of Alberta, our virtual health-care service bridges time and distance for Albertans in need of expeditiously accessing a physician at no cost from the comfort of home, while simultaneously keeping our amazing health-care professionals protected. It is our sincere hope that we can mitigate the enormous pressure on our health-care system through our technology, human ingenuity and compassion.”
Darren Entwistle, president & CEO, TELUS

The service is being delivered to Albertans through an alternative relationship plan (ARP) between the Alberta government and TELUS. There are currently 61 ARPs in Alberta involving 2,500 doctors. 
All physicians providing advice via telephone, email and videoconferencing, including virtual care, can bill for services using the health service code (HSC) 03.01AD. This includes care related to COVID-19 as well as care not related to the virus. The code will remain active as long as the chief medical officer of health determines it should remain active. For more information, physicians can read the updated bulletin on providing telephone advice (Med 221), or email health-pcsp.admin@gov.ab.ca.

“Many people of different faiths in Alberta and across the world celebrate Nowruz, the ancient new year’s tradition of the Persian and Farsi cultures. It is celebrated on the day of the spring equinox, which falls between March 19 and 21.
“A Nowruz tradition among many cultures is the haft-sen table, which features a mirror, food and fresh florals. Each of these items symbolizes spring and new beginnings.
This Nowruz will be a difficult one for many members of Alberta’s Persian community who lost friends and loved ones aboard Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 on Jan. 8. I pray for the consolation of all of those who will mourn the absence of their friends and family members around the haft-sen table this year.
“This is a precious time to spend time together as a family and reconnect to their culture and heritage, however while doing so it is important to stay informed about the best practices in dealing with the spread of COVID-19. That includes proper handwashing, and ensuring that you self-isolate if you are unwell. More information can be found at alberta.ca/COVID19. I urge all Albertans to wish everyone who celebrates Nowruz a very happy and prosperous new year.”

Latest updates

Cases have been identified in all zones across the province:
	
83 cases in the Calgary zone
27 cases in the Edmonton zone
Four cases in the North zone
Three cases in the Central zone
Two cases in the South zone


Of these cases, six are currently hospitalized, with three admitted to intensive care units (ICU).
Aggregate data, showing cases by age range and zone, as well as by local geographical areas, is available online at alberta.ca/covid19.
Multiple cases of COVID-19 have been reported from attendees at the Pacific Dental Conference held in Vancouver March 5 to 7.
	
Individuals who attended the conference should self-isolate immediately for 14 days from the conclusion of the conference.
Individuals who attended the conference and who currently have symptoms should stay home, self-isolate and call Health Link at 811 to arrange for testing and further instructions. Do not go to the hospital or your doctor for


All non-urgent scheduled and elective surgeries in Alberta are being postponed. Alberta Health Services will be contacting Albertans scheduled for procedures and will reschedule as soon as possible. Urgent and emergency surgery, as well as oncology and scheduled caesarean (C-section) procedures will continue.
All non-emergency dental treatment and services are also suspended at this time. Emergency dental treatment will continue.
A tip sheet on social distancing is available to help Albertans understand ways to minimize close contact with others in community settings.
Mass gathering limitations and restrictions around public recreation and private entertainment facilities remain in place across the province.
Effective March 23, and until further notice, all Alberta Transportation Safety Board hearings will be held by telephone or video link. There will be no in-person hearings. Albertans who are currently scheduled for an upcoming hearing will be contacted about how their hearing will proceed.
Effective March 18, all ski hills, including passenger ropeways like gondolas and chairlifts, are closed until further notice under the Safety Codes Act.

Parks and recreation areas
Alberta Parks sites remain accessible, but the public is prohibited from using facilities within the parks. This includes toilets, picnic areas and park warm-up shelters. This is consistent with national parks.
While using the parks, Albertans are reminded to practice appropriate social distancing: https://albertaparks.ca/albertaparksca/news-events/alberta-environment-and-parks-response-to-covid-19/.
Backcountry and Kananaskis enthusiasts are strongly encouraged to choose activities that are low-risk during the COVID-19 response and to stay in areas that support emergency access and present minimal challenges and/or hazards. Backcountry assistance has the potential to add unnecessary stress to the health-care system and put public safety staff at risk (including exposure to COVID-19) which could then impact resources to support search and rescue.
Service Alberta front counter closures
Service Alberta has temporarily closed front counter, in-person access for some services in Edmonton and Calgary. Services remain operational and available, but Albertans should not visit the physical locations for Residential Tenancy Dispute Resolution Service, Corporate Registry and Land Titles, Consumer Investigations & Programs, and Surplus Sales. Call 310-0000 or visit alberta.ca for more information.
Information for travellers
Travel outside the country is strongly discouraged. Given the rapid global spread of the virus, it is no longer possible to assess health risks for the duration of the trip.
Any traveller returning from outside of the country should self-isolate for 14 days, even if they are feeling well, and monitor for symptoms.
Any traveller who has returned before March 12 should closely monitor themselves for symptoms. If they experience symptoms, they should self-isolate immediately and call Health Link 811 for follow-up assessment and testing.
The Alberta government and Travel Alberta have launched a campaign to inform Canadians travelling in the United States and Mexico about the importance of returning home.
COVID-19-related information has been provided for departing and returning passengers at the international airports in both Edmonton and Calgary. This information has also been shared with all airports in Alberta and several airlines.
Quick facts

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately, and staying home and away from others if you are sick.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.
For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, visit alberta.ca/COVID19.

New funding and supportive measures will provide immediate financial relief to Alberta’s families, vulnerable populations, local businesses and employers.

“Albertans are doing their part to keep each other safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19. We are doing ours by assisting Albertans and their families, protecting jobs and supporting workers and employers. We will help shelter Albertans from the economic disruption of COVID-19 now, and position Alberta’s industry and businesses to bounce back when the situation stabilizes. This is an initial set of measures, and more will follow in the days to come.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

Financial supports for Albertans
Albertans should be focused on their health and not worry about whether they can pay their bills, so the government has put a number of options in place for those struggling financially:

Emergency Isolation Support: $50 million
	
This will be a temporary program for working adult Albertans who must self-isolate because they meet the Government of Alberta’s published criteria for self-isolation, including persons who are the sole caregiver for a dependent who must self-isolate because they meet the public health criteria, and who will not have another source of pay or compensation while they are self-isolated.
It will be distributed in one payment instalment and will bridge the gap until the federal emergency payments begin in April.
We expect the program to be accessible by a simple online application through alberta.ca next week and that funds will be deposited in the accounts of eligible recipients beginning at that time.


Utility payment deferral
	
Residential, farm, and small commercial customers can defer bill payments for the next 90 days to ensure no one will be cut off from these services during this time of crisis.
This will cover electricity and natural gas, regardless of the service provider.




Student loans repayment holiday
	
The government will implement a six-month, interest-free moratorium on Alberta student loan payments for all individuals who are in the process of repaying these loans. 



Banks and credit unions

ATB Financial customers impacted by COVID-19
	
Personal banking customers can apply for a deferral on their ATB loans, lines of credit, and mortgages for up to six months.
Small business customers, in addition to payment deferrals on loans and lines of credit, will be provided access to additional working capital.
For other business and agriculture customers, ATB will work with customers on a one-on-one basis and further solutions are being considered at this time.
For more information on ATB’s relief program, please visit their website.


Alberta credit unions
	
Credit union members will have access to a variety of programs and solutions designed to ease difficulties with loan payments and short-term cash flow.
Both individual and business members are encouraged to proactively contact their credit union directly to work out a plan for their personal situation.



Employers
Alberta employers are facing significant challenges and uncertainty. To give them increased access to cash in order to pay employees, address debts and continue operations, the government will:

defer the collection of corporate income tax balances and instalment payments, due after today, until Aug. 31, 2020. This gives Alberta businesses access to about $1.5 billion in funds to help them cope with the COVID-19 crisis.


“In these exceptional circumstances, having cash on hand is vital to families and employers and it’s critical we give Albertans this certainty and support. This tax measure will provide timely relief and additional runway for businesses to continue operating and compensating their employees during this difficult time.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

Alberta is pleased the federal government has responded to concerns and has taken the recommendation to increase supports to people receiving Employment Insurance. Alberta has contributed far more to the federal government in employment insurance (EI) premiums than it receives in EI support, so it is good to see the federal government providing the support Albertans need in these difficult times.
Relief measures already in place
Albertans, seniors and vulnerable groups

Charitable and non-profit groups will immediately receive an additional $60 million to support seniors and other vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This is in addition to the $3.9 billion for community and social services allocated in Budget 2020.

Health care for Albertans

The Government of Alberta has committed $500 million extra this year to respond to the public health crisis and to support front-line health professionals working to keep Albertans safe and healthy. This is in addition to the record-high $20.6 billion allocated for health care in Budget 2020. A further $58 million has been allocated to Alberta health care for COVID-19 response by the federal government.

At about 10:55 p.m. on March 15, EPS officers arrested a 37-year-old male on an outstanding warrant. The man was arrested without incident and transported into custody at the EPS DMU. Officers entered the man’s cell on the afternoon of March 16, and found him unresponsive. The on-duty paramedic provided immediate emergency medical care, including CPR and the administration of naloxone. 911 was also called. At about 2:22 p.m., the man was pronounced dead at the scene.
An autopsy is being conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.
As ASIRT’s investigation is now underway, no further information will be released until the matter is concluded.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

“During these unprecedented times, we want to ensure physicians on the front lines can focus solely on providing patient care. We’ve heard concerns that this change would result in what has been called ‘10-minute medicine.’ While we respectfully disagree with that characterization, we are nevertheless halting this change so that doctors can concentrate on the critical tasks at hand.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“We appreciate the removal of the complex (time) modifier from Alberta Health’s physician funding framework. This is a significant step in supporting patients and physicians. There is still work to be done. We will work in any venue to advance patient care and to reach a formal agreement between physicians and Alberta Health.”
Dr. Christine Molnar, president, Alberta Medical Association

A physician compensation advisory committee will be created to examine all aspects of the physician services funding model and make recommendations supporting the delivery of high-quality patient-focused health services to Albertans. 
Quick facts

Complex modifiers are intended to provide incentives to doctors to spend more time with patients who have complex medical needs.
The first modifier that general practitioners bill for a visit will remain at the 15-minute mark at the current rate of $18.48. Other complex modifiers will remain available at current rates and current time requirements.
Alternatives to fee for service and complex modifiers will be developed with the assistance of the physician compensation advisory committee.
The physician compensation advisory committee will be made up of the public, physicians and Alberta Health.

one case in the North zone


Alberta’s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, is self-isolating at home with minor symptoms consistent with a common cold likely due to the long hours that she has been working in recent weeks. Her symptoms do not appear to be consistent with COVID-19. However, as Dr. Hinshaw plays an essential role in Alberta’s response to COVID-19, she has been tested today.
One Edmonton zone and one Calgary zone case have been confirmed to be the result of community transmission. These are the same two cases that were discussed yesterday.
Materials have been developed to assist travellers returning from outside Canada so they know what to do and how to self-isolate. These materials will be distributed to airports in Edmonton and Calgary.
The Provincial Court of Alberta and Court of Queen’s Bench are limiting operations. Visits to all Alberta provincial correctional facilities and young offender centres are suspended until further notice.
Commercial carriers are essential to the supply chain and are not subject to the current 14-day self-isolation travel requirements. This is based on a review and determination by the Chief Medical Office of Health that appropriate safety measures are in place and is consistent with the air travel industry, and other provinces, such as British Columbia.
All Alberta Parks’ recreation facilities, programs, events and bookings are closed to the public and/or cancelled.
Student attendance at schools is prohibited until further notice.
Post-secondary campuses remain open at this time but in-person classes have been cancelled. Many classes have been moved online.
All licensed child care facilities, out-of-school care programs and preschool programs are closed indefinitely.
All long-term care and other continuing care facilities are advised to limit visitation to essential visitors only.
Places of worship are no longer exempt from restrictions on mass gatherings.
Canadian Blood Services reminds Albertans that the need for blood donors remains strong, and it is safe to donate blood during COVID-19. To learn more, visit blood.ca.

Access to justice services
Family, professional and volunteer visits to all Alberta provincial correctional facilities and young offender centres are suspended until further notice. If defence counsel require an in-person meeting, they must contact the appropriate centre director. If families have questions about their loved ones, they should contact the centre director. 
Current jury trials are proceeding; jurors are required to report to court. Any counsel or juror showing symptoms should contact the court to seek instructions from the presiding judge. Those who received a summons to attend jury selection between March 16 and May 31 are released and do not need to attend. 
Legal Aid Alberta intake services at the Edmonton and Calgary courthouses are closed until further notice. To apply for Legal Aid services, call the Client Contact Centre at 1-866-845-3425, Monday to Friday between 8:15 a.m. and 4:15 p.m.
Traffic First-Appearance Centres are closed until further notice. Albertans can visit www.albertacourts.ca/pc/resources/pay-fines to pay traffic tickets.

Child care
All licensed child care, out-of-school care programs and preschool programs in Alberta are closed indefinitely. Approved day homes are exempt because they care for fewer than seven children at a time, including their own. Whether child care is being provided by day homes or by friends and family, enhanced sanitation practices are encouraged. This includes ensuring handwashing facilities or hand sanitizer are available and children and visitors are encouraged to wash their hands frequently.
­Information for travellers
Travel outside the country is strongly discouraged. Given the rapid global spread of the virus, it is no longer possible to assess health risks for the duration of the trip.
Any traveller returning from outside of the country should self-isolate for 14 days, even if they are feeling well, and monitor for symptoms.
Any traveller who has returned before March 12 should closely monitor themselves for symptoms. If they experience symptoms, they should self-isolate immediately and call Health Link 811 for follow-up assessment and testing.
The Alberta government is working with Travel Alberta on a strategy to inform Canadians returning from travel outside the province about the need to self-isolate, and how to access medical care, if needed.
COVID-19-related information will be available for returning passengers at the international airports in both Edmonton and Calgary; tables with information sheets will be set up in the arrivals areas.
Quick facts

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately, and staying home and away from others if you are sick.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should complete an online COVID-19 self-assessment.

Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deena Hinshaw, accompanied by Premier Jason Kenney, gives an update on COVID-19 in Alberta.

Latest updates

Effective immediately, student attendance at schools is prohibited.
In-person post-secondary classes are cancelled. Campuses will remain open.
All licensed child care facilities, out-of-school care programs and preschool programs are closed indefinitely.
All long-term care and other continuing care facilities are advised to limit visitation to essential visitors only.
Places of worship are no longer exempt from restrictions on mass gatherings.
17 additional cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Alberta, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 56. Three of the new cases are in the Edmonton zone and 14 are in the Calgary zone.
At least two cases identified in the last two days appear to have been acquired through community transmission from an unknown source, and seven cases occurred as a result of a single gathering in the Calgary zone.



“The new cases that have emerged today, particularly those demonstrating transmission into communities and school settings, means we need to put in place additional restrictions for schools, day cares, continuing care facilities, and worship gatherings. These decisions are not made lightly, and I know they will have a tremendous impact on Albertans’ day-to-day lives, particularly parents, children, and seniors. But it is crucial we do everything possible to contain and limit the spread of COVID-19.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

K-12 schools and post-secondary institutions
Effective immediately, students will no longer be attending classes in K-12 schools until further notice. Post-secondary campuses will still remain open, but in-person classes are cancelled. School authorities are expected to continue their regular day-to-day operations and ensure the safety of school facilities. Maintenance, capital projects, cleaning of facilities and administrative work will continue.
Every K-12 student will receive a final mark and students will progress to their next grade level next year. Provincial assessments, such as provincial achievement tests, will be cancelled. At this time, diploma exams essential for post-secondary acceptance will continue. Every student who is eligible to graduate from Grade 12 this year will graduate.
The Alberta government will also be working with post-secondary institutions to ensure that these extraordinary circumstances do not prevent students from being eligible for admission to post-secondary studies for the coming school year.
Teachers and other school staff will still be expected to work, either from home or at their workplace, to ensure these expectations are met. Decisions on how to do this are still to be made, and it may vary depending on the school jurisdiction.
Child care
All licensed child care, out-of-school care programs and preschool programs in Alberta are closed at this time, as well. Approved day homes are exempt because they care for fewer than seven children at a time. These programs are encouraged to use enhanced sanitation practices.
­Mass gatherings
Places of worship are no longer exempt from the recommended restrictions on mass gatherings. Public health officials continue to recommend that all mass gatherings of 250 people or more are cancelled, and this now includes worship gatherings.
Any event that has more than 50 attendees and expects to have international participants, or involves critical infrastructure staff, seniors, or other high-risk populations, should also be cancelled.
Events that do not meet these criteria can proceed at this time, but risk mitigation must be in place, such as enforcing distancing of one to two metres between attendees and using sanitizer stations.
Visitation limits to continuing care and long-term care facilities
Only essential visits to any continuing care or long-term care facility in Alberta are recommended:

Individuals over 60 years of age and those with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk of severe symptoms from COVID-19.
Families and friends of those in these facilities are asked to think of other ways besides visiting that they can support and encourage their loved ones through this difficult time.

Recommended travel advice
Travel outside of the country is not being recommended at this time. Given the rapid global spread of the virus, it is no longer possible to assess health risks for the duration of the trip.
Any traveller returning from outside of the country should self-isolate for 14 days, even if they are feeling well, and monitor for symptoms.
Any traveller who has returned before March 12 should closely monitor themselves for symptoms. If they experience symptoms, they should self-isolate immediately and call Health Link 811 for follow-up assessment and testing.

Six of the new cases are in Calgary Zone and four are in Edmonton Zone.
Two of the new cases, one in Edmonton Zone and the other in Calgary Zone, have been admitted into intensive care. All other new cases are self-isolating at home and expected to make a full recovery.
Eight of the new cases have been confirmed to be related to international travel or to a previously confirmed case. Investigations are ongoing on the remaining two cases.

“Given the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, we know parents, students, and school officials are very concerned. I want to assure all Albertans that their children’s safety is top of mind in all our decisions, and we are making the best public health decisions we can with the information we have, in this rapidly developing situation. We are prepared to make changes if and when the situation warrants it.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

School update
A conference call was held today with the chief medical officer of health and more than 500 representatives from Alberta’s school boards, school authorities, and education stakeholders.
On March 13, Alberta recommended that schools remain open at this time. The World Health Organization does not recommend school closures as the only way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in children.
Alberta continues to monitor the province’s situation carefully. If the situation warrants it, the Alberta government could direct the closure of an individual school, a group of schools, an entire school division, or all schools in the province. This would be a decision of Cabinet’s emergency management committee.
In meantime, all schools should take steps to protect the health of students and staff:

eliminate large gatherings of students
ensure no more than 250 people are in the same room at any given time
consider cancelling extracurricular activities that involve physical contact

A new guide has been developed to help schools and daycares reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. The guide is available at alberta.ca/COVID19.
We will continue to update this document based on feedback received from education stakeholders.
Flight Information
There are more and more flights with passengers confirmed to have the virus. Albertans should self-monitor their air travel, so that public health officials can use their time to trace other contacts. Those who have recently returned to Alberta via a flight, are encouraged to visit alberta.ca/COVID19 for flight information and to self-isolate if found to be at risk of exposure.
Government will be posting flight information that includes the flight number, date and any seats on the flight that might be at risk of exposure to COVID-19. Passengers in affected seats are encouraged to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival in Canada and monitor for symptoms. Other passengers are not required to self-isolate but should monitor for symptoms as a precaution.
Certain professions may be exempt from travel restrictions. Any exemptions are being determined on a case-by-case basis after consultation with industry stakeholders. At this time, flight attendants and pilots are exempted from travel recommendations, provided they practice good hygiene and take precautions to limit their risk.
Updated resources

Flight information is posted under the “Info for Albertans” section.
The new guide for schools and child care programs has been posted under “Info for schools and child care centres.”
A new information sheet on mass gatherings, including risk mitigation strategies, has been posted under “Public health restrictions on mass gatherings.”
Information posters are available under “Resources” for organizations and businesses to distribute.
Alberta Health Services has launched an online self-assessment tool to help Albertans determine whether they should get tested for COVID-19. Over 300,000 Albertans completed self-assessments within the first 24 hours.

Quick facts

Alberta’s Provincial Operations Centre in Edmonton elevated from a level 2 to a level 3 – out of a possible 4. Level 3 indicates an increased amount of cross-government coordination through the Alberta Emergency Management Agency.
The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately, and staying home and away from others if you are sick.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should contact Health Link 811 to see if follow up testing is required.

Effective immediately, the Alberta government is asking all large gatherings or international events in the province to be cancelled and advising Albertans against travel outside of the country.
Four new cases of COVID-19 have now been confirmed in Alberta, bringing the total number in the province to 23, all travel-related. One patient continues to recover in hospital, while all others are in isolation at home.

“We are doing everything possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our province. The virus is spreading rapidly and is now a global threat. We are implementing these new measures to slow its spread and limit the risks in the weeks ahead. Protecting the health of Albertans is, and always will be, our top priority.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health


“The coming weeks are vital in our fight to protect Alberta from COVID-19. These are serious steps, and ones we do not take lightly. I am calling on every Albertan and organization to assist our public health efforts and do their very best to comply with the public health guidance. It is critical that Albertans come together to do our part in keeping Albertans healthy and safe.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

New public health restrictions
Alberta is asking organizers to cancel any events that have more than 250 attendees. This includes large sporting events, conferences and community events. It does not extend to places of worship, grocery stores, airports or shopping centres.
Any event that has more than 50 attendees and expects to have international participants, or involves critical infrastructure staff, seniors, or other high-risk populations should also be cancelled.
Events that do not meet these criteria can proceed, but risk mitigation must be in place, such as sanitizer stations and distancing between attendees.
At this time, schools and daycares can remain open but steps should be taken to ensure that no more than 250 individuals are in the same room at any given time.
Effective March 12, all Albertans who are currently outside the country should self-isolate on their return for 14 days, independent of the country they were visiting.
New cases of COVID-19
Four additional cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the province. One of the confirmed cases is a two-year-old child from the Calgary zone who is now recovering at home.
The child who has tested positive for COVID-19 returned with their family from a vacation in Florida and developed mild symptoms once in Alberta. The child attended a local daycare from March 2-6 and tested positive on March 11.
The child is expected to make a full recovery.
As soon as the case tested positive, health officials took immediate action to protect the health of Albertans. On the advice of Alberta Health Services, the daycare has temporarily closed to limit exposure to the virus. All close contacts are self-isolating for 14 days while being monitored by health officials.
Any Albertan who has not been contacted directly by Alberta Health Services is not at risk.
The other three newly confirmed cases involve a woman in her thirties, a male in his fifties, and a woman in her seventies. They are all from the Calgary zone.
The travellers returned from travelling in Jordan, Egypt, France, Germany, and the United States, specifically Florida.
All Albertans are encouraged to visit alberta.ca/COVID19 for the latest information, guidance and resources.

There are now 19 confirmed cases in Alberta, all travel-related. One patient continues to recover in hospital, while all others are in isolation at home.

“Today, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Alberta has been actively planning for every possible scenario. We know that COVID-19 is going to test our health system and emergency preparedness, but our system is preparing for that test. While the risk of exposure is still low in Alberta, all partners are working together to limit the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of Albertans.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health


“Alberta’s health system is actively preparing for every possible scenario. Having visited an AHS emergency coordination centre and Health Link 811, and having toured stockpiles of personal protective equipment, sanitizers and other supplies, I’ve seen first-hand that our health system is working very hard to protect the health of Albertans.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

One of the confirmed cases involves an Edmonton man in his thirties who recently returned from international travel and started experiencing symptoms a number of days after returning. He received previously scheduled, unrelated treatment at Misericordia Hospital on March 6 and 7, before testing positive for COVID-19 on March 9. He is now self-isolating.
Any staff or patients who were potentially exposed at this location are being directly contacted by public health. There is no risk to any patients or staff at the hospital at this time.
The other confirmed cases involve a man in his twenties and two women in their thirties from the Calgary zone. A female in her thirties from Central zone has also tested positive for COVID-19.
The five newly confirmed cases had returned from visiting a range of countries, including Iran, Egypt, Spain, Mexico and the United States.
Alberta continues widespread testing and aggressive public health measures.
Effective immediately, Alberta will now be asking any travellers who have visited Italy in the last 14 days to self-isolate until two weeks have passed since that visit. These individuals should stay home and away from others, even if they are feeling well. Similar precautions are already in place for travellers returning from Iran and Hubei province, China.
All travellers returning from outside Canada should monitor their health for 14 days after coming home. If they develop symptoms, they should self-isolate immediately and call Health Link 811.
While the risk of catching COVID-19 within the province remains low at this time, this may change in the future.
All Albertans are encouraged to visit alberta.ca/COVID19 for the latest information, guidance and resources.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Over the next three years, a total of $5.7 billion will be invested in maintaining and repairing Alberta highways and supporting water management and flood recovery projects, along with various grant programs.
Approximately $1.17 billion will be put toward maintaining and improving the condition of Alberta’s existing highways and bridges. These investments will ensure Albertans can travel safely and efficiently and get the best value for their tax dollars by extending the lifespan of our highway network and reducing the need for expensive reconstruction in the future.
Budget 2020 also includes $2.3 billion for road and bridge construction projects across Alberta, including the Calgary and Edmonton Ring Roads, improvements to Deerfoot Trail in Calgary and other important projects, including continued twinning work on the Peace River Bridge.

“We have heard loud and clear that Albertans want us to focus on fixing our existing roads and bridges. At the same time, we need to think creatively about getting key projects built that boost the economic potential of regions across the province. Budget 2020 provides the public infrastructure that families and communities need by making targeted investments on projects that will create jobs and get Alberta’s economy back on track.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation

Government will focus on projects that grow the economy by creating jobs and promoting trade. This includes working with job creators and investors to find creative ways to fund new infrastructure projects that may not otherwise get built.
Quick facts

Budget 2020 includes:
	
$1.4 billion for the Calgary and Edmonton Ring Roads:
		
$1.36 billion for the Calgary Ring Road, including the southwest and west projects and upgrades to five kilometres of the northeast segment
$67 million for the southwest Anthony Henday Drive expansion  


$66 million for the east and west phases of the Highway 19 twinning project between the QEII and Highway 60
$10.5 million for the Highway 1A expansion within the Stoney Nakoda First Nation, between Cochrane and Canmore
$34.5 million for continued work on the Peace River Bridge twinning project
Funding for the twinning of Highway 40, which is estimated to cost between $100 and $120 million


$109.9 million is identified for improvements to Deerfoot Trail in Calgary, with $99.7 million in future years.
Alberta has a vast provincial highway network that includes more than 31,400 kilometres of highways (equivalent to nearly 64,000 lane kilometres) and nearly 4,600 bridges, overpasses and culverts.

Premier Jason Kenney speaks to media in the Calgary International Airport before departing for the First Ministers Meeting in Ottawa.


“Alberta and Canada are currently in uncharted territory, facing an economic crisis complicated by a public health threat, so it’s more important than ever for Canada’s premiers and prime minister to be laser-focused on protecting jobs and providing relief. I’m looking forward to ensuring Alberta jobs and the unique concerns of our provincial economy are priorities on the national stage.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

The public health threat of the COVID-19 virus, which has already resulted in a global economic slowdown, will be top of mind for the Alberta delegation at the meeting. Premier Kenney welcomes the federal government’s recent announcement to expand eligibility for the Employment Insurance program and looks forward to working with the federal government to ensure that Albertans following medical advice and self-isolating or in quarantine from COVID-19 can access necessary financial supports without delay.
Premier Kenney will also be sending the message that shocks to our energy industry from an oil price war between Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States is a national economic concern, not just a western issue. It will require federal as well as provincial help to protect workers and employers, including measures such as payroll tax relief, job-creating stimulus, and access to capital to ensure our companies do not become collateral damage in a geopolitical economic war and to help our economy survive the worst that is ahead and emerge stronger when it ends.
These global threats transcend provincial boundaries and require bold leadership to ensure our province is resilient and safe. Our workers and companies, as well as global investors, need to see that we have a plan to protect jobs and our economy during these uncertain times.
Among the requests Premier Kenney will be making or reiterating in Ottawa are:

An “equalization rebate” and reform of the Fiscal Stabilization Program
Immediate relief for job creators and workers to get them through the current crisis, including expanded EI rules, payroll tax relief, and access to capital
Economic competitiveness to show global investors Canada is still a place that can approve and build major projects
Funding, such as flow-through shares, to stimulate clean and emissions-reducing technology
Job-creating funding for decommissioning orphan and inactive wells
Stimulus through accelerated infrastructure spending and funds to match Alberta’s new Blueprint for Jobs 


“Even before the current fiscal crisis, our province has led the way in reaching out to other provinces to build a consensus on issues such as reforming the federal Fiscal Stabilization Program to provide an ‘Equalization Rebate,’ building pipelines and economic corridors to get our goods to global markets, opening up interprovincial free trade, and calling for regulatory certainty on permitting and approval for major projects. Now more than ever, we will continue to stand up for Alberta and make the case for these priorities in the interest of Albertans and all Canadians.”
Jason Kenney, Premier 

At the Council of the Federation meeting in December 2019, Canada’s premiers unilaterally supported Alberta’s call for retroactive reforms to the Fiscal Stabilization Program that remove unreasonable and outdated caps and provides Alberta with a retroactive payment of $2.4 billion that the government would use to get Albertans back to work. The Alberta delegation will continue to push for the federal government to adopt these changes, along with new actions from the provinces and the federal government to address the “perfect storm” of economic threats posed by COVID-19 and the Russia-Saudi oil price war. With or without Ottawa, the Government of Alberta will consider all options and take all necessary action to protect Alberta jobs and employers.
The First Ministers’ Meeting is on March 13.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




There are now 14 confirmed cases in Alberta, and all of them are travel-related.
These new cases of COVID-19 are all recovering in isolation at home with support from public health officials. One previously announced individual is currently receiving treatment in hospital. This person had a pre-existing chronic condition.

“While new cases are always concerning, Albertans should know that increases are expected as we work aggressively to limit the virus’s spread. We are all in this together. Every one of us has a role to play in protecting our families, friends and fellow Canadians. The precautionary measures you take now will help shield yourself and others, especially seniors and people with pre-existing medical conditions, from this virus.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health


“Alberta is well-prepared for this challenge, and our system continues to respond quickly and effectively to every confirmed case. I want to thank all of our health professionals for their continued dedication. We will ensure that our public health professionals and the health system overall have the resources they need to protect Albertans, now and in the days ahead.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Three of the new cases are from the Edmonton zone. They involve a male in his seventies and a female in her sixties who had travelled together, and a female in her thirties who had also recently travelled outside of Canada.
The other four new cases are from the Calgary zone. They involve a male in his fifties, two females in their thirties and a female in her forties.
The travellers had returned from visiting a range of countries, including France, the Netherlands, Egypt, Iran, Taiwan, Germany, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago, Panama, the Philippines and the United States. Several of the cases visited more than one country on their trip. One individual was also on the same MS Braemar cruise ship in the Caribbean as a case announced March 9.
As part of Alberta’s COVID-19 response, public health teams are already identifying and notifying anyone who came into close contact with these individuals. All close contacts displaying symptoms are being tested. Even those not displaying symptoms will self-isolate for 14 days to prevent any possible spread if they were to display symptoms in the future.
The risk level in Alberta is currently low, though this may change in the coming weeks.
Additional recommended public health measures

All Albertans should practise good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, and should stay home if feeling ill.
All travellers returning from outside Canada should monitor their health for 14 days after coming home. If they develop symptoms, they should self-isolate and call Health Link 811.
All travellers returning from Iran or Hubei Province, China, should self-isolate until 14 days have passed since their visit. If they develop symptoms, they should call Health Link 811.
Anyone experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever or cough linked to recent travel or other health concerns should contact Health Link 811.
Anyone who is feeling ill, even if they have not travelled, should stay home and not visit hospitals, long-term care facilities or supportive living accommodations. Albertans who are not experiencing symptoms can continue to visit loved ones in these facilities.
Anyone organizing group events should undertake a risk assessment considering who may attend, the nature of the event, and what is happening in their local community.  
All municipalities, businesses and other organizations should continue business continuity planning to prepare critical operations for any potential interruption.

Transportation Minister Ric McIver was in Fort McMurray to announce the province will invest more than $50 million in safety and travel upgrades to Hwy. 881, including 14 passing lanes.

The province will spend more than $50 million over the next four years to add passing lanes, build a new staging/rest area, and improve intersections and roadside turnouts along the route between Lac La Biche and Anzac.

“We are focused on growing our economy and getting Albertans back to work, and our Blueprint for Jobs is our plan to bring jobs and job creators to Alberta through targeted investments in key infrastructure. Highway 881 is an important route for heavy trucks, equipment and passenger vehicles moving north into Alberta’s oilsands. Upgrading this highway will make travel easier for drivers on this route by building passing lanes to get around the heavy and super-heavy equipment heading to our oilsands regions. Improving Highway 881 will also encourage future investment in our energy sector by making it easier to move into and out of northern Alberta.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation

The 37-kilometre project, which is part of government’s A Blueprint for Jobs, starts southeast of Fort McMurray. Currently there are no passing lanes in either direction along this stretch of highway.

“Highway 881 is an important transportation route within our region. This project will not only improve the safety of all those who travel along this route, it will expand economic opportunities for the communities and projects along this highway. This much-needed upgrade, including passing lanes, will improve the lives of those who live and work in this region.”
Laila Goodridge, MLA for Fort McMurray-Lac La Biche

Engineering and design work for this project is underway.

“This is very positive news for our region. We thank Minister McIver and the Alberta government for this key investment in transportation infrastructure that will benefit our communities, enhance public safety and support economic growth for industry, workers, and all of us. Premier Kenney, Minister McIver and the Alberta government understand the importance of our region to the rest of Alberta and this funding announcement demonstrates their commitment to our residents and our communities.”
Don Scott, mayor, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo

Construction on the project is slated to begin in 2022.

“This is great news for the members of the Coalition for Safer Alberta Roads and all road users on Highway 881. We are very pleased to hear about the commitment this government is making to improve the infrastructure on our highways. Highway 881 is a lifeline for many communities in the region and it is where a large number of our members' operations are located. I have a deep respect for everyone involved in finding the budget and resources for the long-awaited improvements to Highway 881.” 
Debbie Hammond, executive director, Coalition for Safer Alberta Roads

This announcement is part of government’s A Blueprint for Jobs, a plan to bring jobs and investment back to Alberta and restore the province’s position as the best place in the country to live, work, start a business, and raise a family. The Government of Alberta is focused on creating jobs, growing the economy and getting Alberta back to work.
Quick facts

Until 2006, Highway 881 was a two-lane gravel road with narrow shoulders. Some sections still have narrow shoulders that become congested with high volumes of heavy and over-sized loads.
Upgrades will provide better access to new developments along this stretch of Highway 881.
This project is expected to create:
	
145 direct jobs
100 indirect jobs

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The collision occurred near Chipman, and took place that same day.
At about 5:30 a.m., RCMP were dispatched to a commercial intrusion alarm at a location in the Village of Consort. RCMP officers from Vegreville, Tofield, Killam, and Viking detachments responded. A suspect vehicle was identified, and when RCMP attempted to contain it, it drove away at a high rate of speed. Additional RCMP vehicles entered the area near Chipman, and had intermittent contact with the suspect vehicle, which continued travelling at excessive speeds.
At a location near Chipman, the suspect vehicle turned south on Range Road 184, where a bridge was under repair, and collided with concrete barricades on the roadway. The vehicle was badly damaged and the two male occupants were trapped inside. The local fire department and EMS responded and extracted the two males from the vehicle. A 37-year-old male was transported by STARS air ambulance to hospital in Edmonton. A 40-year-old male was transported by ground ambulance to the same hospital. Both males were listed in critical condition with various injuries.
ASIRT’s investigation will focus on the actions of police during this incident, while the RCMP will maintain responsibility for the investigation into the circumstances that led up to the incident, as well as the occupants of the vehicle. As the investigation is underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

There are now seven confirmed cases of the virus in Alberta. These individuals are all recovering in isolation at home with support from public health officials.

“These cases were detected thanks to the aggressive public health measures and expanded testing that we have put in place. By acting quickly to isolate close contacts of COVID-19 cases, we help prevent the virus’s spread and protect Albertans. While additional cases will likely be detected in the coming days, Albertans can trust that we are doing everything we can to protect their health.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health 


“Alberta and the rest of Canada are working extremely hard to detect and isolate COVID-19 to limit the spread in our communities. I have every faith in our dedicated health-care providers and remind all Albertans that medical experts still consider the risk level to be low in our province.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health 

Case 5 is a woman in her seventies who lives in the Edmonton zone. She is a close contact of an Edmonton zone man with COVID-19, who was announced on March 8. She was also on-board a Grand Princess Cruise before returning home on Feb. 21. Her symptoms started after returning to Alberta.
Case 6 is a man in his thirties from the Calgary zone. He is a close contact of the Calgary zone woman announced as a case of COVID-19 on March 8. He had travelled to Ukraine, Netherlands and Turkey and returned to Alberta on March 2. His symptoms started after his return.
Case 7 is a woman in her fifties from the Calgary zone. She was on-board the MS Braemar cruise ship from Feb. 11 to March 4. She developed symptoms after her return home and was tested at an assessment centre on March 8.
Public health investigations into these new cases are underway. Close contacts have been identified and are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days. These individuals will be monitored for symptoms during this time.
All cases of COVID-19 announced in Alberta are now confirmed. Positive samples tested by Alberta laboratories no longer require further confirmation from the National Microbiology Laboratory.
Alberta continues to ask all returning travellers from outside Canada to monitor their health and, if they experience symptoms of fever or cough, to immediately self-isolate and call Health Link 811.
Anyone who is feeling ill should stay home and not visit hospitals, long-term care facilities or supportive living accommodations. People in these locations are at the highest risk of complications from COVID-19, influenza and other respiratory viruses.
Albertans are strongly encouraged to visit alberta.ca/COVID19 for advice on preparing for COVID-19, testing and other useful information.
Quick facts

The current risk of being exposed to COVID-19 in Alberta is low.
The most important measure that Albertans can take to prevent COVID-19 is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately, and especially staying home and away from others if you are sick.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 linked to recent travel should contact Health Link 811 to see if followup testing is required.

The third presumed case of COVID-19 is a man who had recently been on a Grand Princess Cruise before returning to Alberta on Feb. 21.
The fourth presumed case is a close contact of someone who had recently travelled in Europe, including visits to Ukraine, Turkey and the Netherlands.
Public health investigations into these new cases have already begun. Close contacts are being identified and asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Health officials will actively monitor these individuals for symptoms during this time.

The individual is a male in his forties who lives in the Edmonton zone. The case is travel-related and he is recovering in isolation at home with support from public health officials.

“While I know some Albertans may be concerned by a second case, this is not unexpected. The risk to Albertans is still considered low. We have already isolated this individual and are taking swift action to implement immediate precautions to prevent the infection from spreading.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health


“I have full confidence that our front-line health-care workers are ready and able to handle this challenge. Thanks to Alberta’s focused preparations, this case has been quickly identified and all the immediate first steps required to protect the public and our front-line health-care staff are being taken.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The affected individual recently returned from travel in the United States. He had visited Michigan, Illinois, and Ohio, before returning to Alberta on Feb 28. He is currently in isolation at home.
The case was detected on March 6. Health officials are currently identifying close contacts of this individual and will be asking them to self-isolate at home, away from the public. They will be closely monitored by public health officials. If they do develop symptoms, health officials will coordinate getting them into care immediately while ensuring that the public and health-care workers are not exposed.
Effective immediately, Alberta will be expanding its testing protocols. All travellers returning from outside of Canada are advised to monitor their symptoms. If they experience flu-related symptoms, such as a fever or a cough, they should self-isolate and call Health Link at 811 to arrange followup testing. Returning travellers should not visit emergency departments or urgent care centres for testing. Calling 811 is the best way to get quick assessment and testing.
This applies only to returning travellers who are symptomatic with fever, or cough.
The risk of exposure is still considered low in Alberta, however this may change over the coming weeks, and if it does, we will communicate this to Albertans.
Alberta Health and Alberta Health Services will continue to closely monitor the situation, conduct surveillance and appropriate laboratory testing, and provide public health and infection control guidance.

“With daylight saving time officially arriving at 2 a.m. on Sunday, March 8, Albertans are advised to set their clocks to ‘spring forward’ by one hour before going to bed Saturday night.
“As many are aware, government invited Albertans to participate in a survey last year about daylight saving time. Of the 141,000 Albertans who responded, 91 per cent told us they would prefer to stay on summer hours year-round, rather than continue to change their clocks twice a year.
“With a decision about time zones, we must consider what our partners from other jurisdictions are doing and avoid taking actions that would leave Alberta out of sync with our neighbours. As part of that process, we are continuing to have conversations with key organizations and members of the business community.
“We know more and more governments are contemplating this move to permanent summer hours, including British Columbia, which has passed legislation to enable the province to move to one permanent time, and Yukon, who will be changing their clocks for the last time this Sunday.
“We are also actively reaching out to our partners in Eastern Canada to discuss the option of moving together in unison. We will update Albertans when decisions are made.”

Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw speaks about the first presumptive case of COVID-19 in Alberta.

The individual is a woman in her fifties who lives in the Calgary zone. The case is travel-related and she is recovering in isolation at home with support from public health officials.

“We take this extremely seriously, and are doing all we can to minimize risk and to keep Albertans safe. While some may be concerned, I remind Albertans that the risk is still low in our province. We are already taking the necessary precautions to prevent the infection from spreading.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health


“Alberta’s health-care system is ready and already taking swift action. Measures to protect both the public and front-line health-care workers have been in place for weeks. I have full confidence that our front-line health-care workers are ready and able to handle this challenge.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The affected individual had recently returned from travel on board a Grand Princess cruise ship in California. Officials detected the case on March 5.
Health officials are currently identifying close contacts of this individual. They will also be asked to self-isolate at home, away from the public, and will be closely monitored by public health officials. If they do develop symptoms, health officials will coordinate getting them into care immediately while ensuring that the public and health-care workers are not exposed.
Health officials are asking anyone who has returned from a Grand Princess Cruise to Alberta in the last two weeks to self-isolate until 14 days have passed since their visit.
Since January, Alberta’s public health officials have been working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada and other partners to monitor COVID-19 and assess public health risks.
Alberta Health and Alberta Health Services will continue to closely monitor the situation, conduct surveillance and appropriate laboratory testing, and provide public health and infection control guidance.
The risk is still considered low in Alberta.
Quick facts

The most important measures that Albertans can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, is to practise good hygiene.
	
This includes cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow or sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately, and staying home and away from others if you are sick.


Anyone who has health concerns or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should contact Health Link 811 to see if followup testing is required.

“Our top priority is the health of Albertans. There continue to be no probable or confirmed cases in Alberta. The risk to Albertans of catching the novel coronavirus is very low.
“We are committed to working with all of our health partners to ensure proven processes and well-trained teams are in place to both protect the public and respond if COVID-19 should arrive in our province.
“I understand that there has been concern expressed by some physicians that they are not receiving enough information about the role of primary care in the response. This is a concern, and we will work to ensure that our communications and coordinated planning efforts reach all health-care providers who will be impacted by COVID-19.
“Since January, Alberta Health has been working with Alberta Health Services (AHS) and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta (CPSA), among others, to provide information and guidance to physicians on the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. Department staff are meeting weekly with all key health professional colleges to ensure they are aware of the planning underway and to get their assistance in sharing important information with their members.
“As a physician, I know that health professionals must be properly informed. Information is being shared on a regular – sometimes even daily ­– basis, including a new FAQ for primary care providers that was shared today. We continue working closely with AHS, the Alberta Medical Association, the CPSA and the Alberta College of Family Physicians to provide regular information to physicians.
“We are committed to working with all other health-care providers to ensure a collaborative response to the evolving COVID-19 outbreak. We will take whatever steps are needed to ensure Alberta’s health system is prepared.”

Indigenous Relations Minister Rick Wilson (left) and Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women Minister Leela Sharon Aheer (right) announced the new Alberta Joint Working Group on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.


“I am confident the individuals appointed to the Alberta Joint Working Group on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls will be guided by experience and humanity, and will make thoughtful and wise recommendations. We said Alberta would respond to the calls for justice and we are. We are moving forward to make our province a safe place for Indigenous women and girls.”
Rick Wilson, Minister of Indigenous Relations

The Alberta government has appointed three Indigenous community members and three members of the legislative assembly to inform a government action plan that responds to the calls for justice of the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.

“It is our collective responsibility to prevent violence against women and girls. This joint working group is a vital part of our commitment to addressing the national inquiry, ending all forms of violence against Indigenous women and girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA making Alberta a safer place for all.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women

The joint working group will support the government’s actions by:

Advising on options to address issues of violence and the calls for justice.
Making recommendations on how to work with Indigenous communities, other governments and the private sector to leverage actions to combat violence against Indigenous women and girls.
Providing input and making recommendations on the government’s action plan.

The joint working group has a one-year mandate, which may be extended.
Quick facts

The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls was established by the federal government in December 2015.
The final report was released on June 3, 2019, and contains 231 calls for justice.
In Canada, statistics show that Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or missing than any other women in Canada.
Between 1980 and 2012 in Alberta, there were 206 murdered Indigenous women, accounting for 28 per cent of all female homicide victims in the province in that time period.
In 2017, there were 4.22 homicides of Aboriginal females per 100,000 people, an increase of 32 per cent from the previous year. This rate is six times higher than that of non-Aboriginal females.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The Supervised Consumption Services Review Committee listened to more than 19,000 Albertans’ concerns about the impacts supervised consumption services (SCS) sites are having on their homes, businesses and neighbourhoods.
The final report contains the committee’s findings regarding needle debris, social disorder, public safety and other concerns. The committee found serious problems with supervised consumption services as they are currently being operated, and provided thoughtful considerations for improving services and community safety, while building a comprehensive recovery-oriented system of care that offers the greatest chance to lift vulnerable Albertans with addiction out of their current plight.

“This report is a wake-up call for Alberta. Every one of us deserves to feel safe in our communities, and every Albertan struggling with addiction should be able to access the supports they need. We will consider this report, and all other relevant evidence, as we develop a comprehensive, long-term approach that works. That means improving addiction treatment services and supports to create a full continuum of care across the province.”
Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions


“Crime grows in areas where illegal drug use is on the rise. Our government supports a firm justice system that includes investigating, disrupting and dismantling the organized crime groups that supply and sell illegal drugs that fuel addiction, ruin people’s lives and take a terrible toll on our communities. We’ll continue to ensure law enforcement and the justice system have the tools and resources to protect community safety.
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


“Thank you to all Albertans who participated in this process. Our committee was given a mandate to hear from people across the province on all sides of this important issue. The findings in this report demonstrate the compassion many Albertans feel for their neighbours and their commitment to creating safe, welcoming communities for everyone.”
Rod Knecht, chair, Supervised Consumption Services Review Committee


“Our committee heard from thousands of passionate Albertans, and reviewed a wide range of data and evidence sources to examine what impact these services are having on the communities around them. The findings may be difficult for some to hear, but are vital to improving the health and well-being of those who use the sites and those who live in surrounding neighbourhoods.”
Geri Bemister-Williams, vice-chair, Supervised Consumption Services Review Committee

Key findings from the report include:

Increased needle debris and deteriorating public safety around the sites were significant concerns raised during the town halls, through the surveys and in stakeholder meetings.
While there were no deaths recorded among people at the SCS sites, death rates in the immediate vicinity of the sites after the sites opened continued to increase along with province-wide rates of opioid deaths.
Opioid-related calls for emergency medical services also increased in the immediate vicinity following the opening of the sites.
Many people indicated they felt less safe in the areas surrounding the SCS sites after they opened.
Lack of focus on referrals to detoxification and treatment resources.
Inconsistent and often inaccurate classification of “overdose reversals.”
Substantial increases in the use of non-opioid substance use, specifically methamphetamines, leading to aggressive behaviour endangering public safety.

Over the coming months, the government will consider changes to supervised consumption services and other addiction treatment and recovery resources, on a city-by-city basis.
Quick facts

The eight-member committee included First Nations people, experts in addiction and recovery, harm reduction, mental health, trauma, pain management, law enforcement, crime reduction and justice, as well as people with lived experience.
16,831 individuals and 440 businesses submitted feedback to the committee through an online survey.
About 1,800 people attended the town halls in Edmonton, Red Deer, Calgary, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat and Grande Prairie.
More than 500 first responders and more than 50 stakeholder groups provided evidence and shared concerns with the committee.

“Today’s decision by the Supreme Court of Canada further clears the way for the completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project. All five applications that were previously dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal in 2019 have been denied the right to appeal.
“However, the illegal protests and blockades occurring across the country in recent weeks continue to be of concern. The same well-funded and organized groups involved with the protest camps, sabotaging of public infrastructure, and the shutdown of Canada’s railway will stand in opposition to future major infrastructure projects – especially oil and gas.
“This type of unrest has serious ramifications on not just Alberta’s economy, but all of Canada’s. These protestors do not speak on behalf of First Nations, but actually stand in the way of First Nations becoming true partners in prosperity. The rule of law must be maintained so that these projects can be completed on time and on schedule.”

The project will strengthen health analytics and set the vision for a “data access safe haven.” The safe haven will store valuable provincial health and non-health data in a secure environment that will safeguard and protect personal information.

“Alberta is joining other leading jurisdictions by developing a data-sharing environment and process with real-world applications. Improving access to data in a safe, secure and strategic way with government partners, academics and health organizations will mean we can drive investment and cutting-edge research and development to help improve health outcomes.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The province will leverage its existing data warehouse to grant safe access to select health organizations, some Alberta government ministries, researchers, and data analysts so they can use this rich bank of information to improve Alberta’s health system and other government services and programs. The data of Alberta citizens will not be for sale.
Interested vendors have one month to submit their proposals.

“The Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary is driven to create the future of health. Our Centre for Health Informatics is a brilliant example, accelerating our effort to harness the power of data to innovate since opening in 2018. When health researchers, clinicians and educators are able to leverage data, they’re better able to detect disease, personalize interventions and improve health. We look forward to continued collaboration in data management with Alberta Health, Alberta Health Services, and the many other partners that will be required to ensure world-class technology solutions are working together to make lives better for Albertans.”
Dr. Jon Meddings, dean, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary


“We are very excited at the prospect of an enhanced data storage system and accompanying strategy for our province. A major strength in Alberta is access our researchers have to valuable health data, allowing them to conduct high-quality medical research that advances the health outcomes of Albertans. The improved access provided by a digital data warehouse of this kind will further strengthen Alberta’s reputation as a leading academic research hub in Canada and globally.”
Dr. Brenda Hemmelgarn, dean, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta

The government is also open to private-sector partners who want to invest in research that can transform front-line care and lead to better health outcomes and quality of life for patients and Albertans.

""OKAKI has worked closely with Alberta Health, First Nations, universities, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and others to use data to strengthen public health. This work has helped raise immunization rates, improve outcomes for patients with diabetes and reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing. Alberta has some of the richest health data in Canada, and harnessing the potential of that data will unleash innovation at home. If Alberta companies like ours could appropriately access this data to develop technology and applications, while ensuring patient privacy, we could continue to do better for Albertans, enhance our competitiveness and create more high-quality jobs of the future.""
Dr. Salim Samanani, CEO and Medical Director, OKAKI Health Intelligence Inc.

Government aims to have the new data warehouse ready for its first users in fall 2020.
Quick facts

Alberta Health will lead, govern and manage the new data safe haven, using clear controls and agreements to protect the privacy of individuals.
Alberta Health holds up to 35 years of health data for Albertans.
Other provincial ministries will be able to access data to develop strong policy and align work across government.
The academic sector, as well as organizations such as Alberta Health Services, the Alberta Medical Association and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, will be granted secure access to the data.

Large-scale renovations and some new operating rooms in Edmonton, Calgary, Grande Prairie and Lethbridge will allow those hospitals to focus on providing more complex surgeries, leaving rural sites and chartered surgical facilities to provide additional lower risk surgeries.

“Albertans deserve a world-class health system that delivers the right care, in the right setting, at the right time. This funding from Budget 2020 will drive down wait times with necessary and overdue upgrades to hospital operating rooms and equipment across the province. Ultimately, we will make sure our health-care system has the capacity and the staff to deliver the best access to surgery in Canada.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“This is great news for Albertans who need surgeries and want more access to quality health care in their home communities. This $100 million for capital projects will have a cascading effect, improving access to surgeries in big city hospitals, but also in rural communities across the province, so people can get care closer to home. It’s just the start of our government’s commitment to ensure the success of the Alberta Surgical Initiative. We are working exceptionally hard to ensure we build the best health system possible in this wonderful province.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

This capital funding is part of the government’s $500-million commitment in Budget 2020 to drive down wait times and provide all medically necessary surgeries within clinically appropriate times. Savings found through the AHS Review will support this initiative.
The $100 million in capital funding will be spent on surgical infrastructure and equipment, including:

Upgrades to 12 operating rooms at Calgary’s Foothills Medical Centre. Low-risk surgeries will be moved out of the Foothills hospital and offered in Canmore, High River and independent surgical facilities in Calgary, relieving pressures on city hospitals with long wait lists.
A fit-out of an operating room in Grande Prairie and converting space in the Edson Health Centre into a second operating room.
Renovations at the Rocky Mountain House Health Centre so it can perform more endoscopy procedures and create more space in the Red Deer hospital to focus on more complex surgeries. Low-risk surgeries will also be moved out of the Red Deer Hospital to be offered in Innisfail, Stettler, Ponoka and Olds.
Renovations to operating departments at the Royal Alexandra Hospital and the University of Alberta Hospital, including the addition of one new operating room. Lower risk procedures will be moved to the Fort Saskatchewan Health Centre, the Grey Nuns Community Hospital and the Sturgeon Community Hospital in St. Albert.
Renovations at the Medicine Hat Regional Hospital.
Combining two smaller operating rooms into one larger space for more complex surgeries at Lethbridge’s Chinook Regional Hospital.

This capital investment will help AHS add over 17,000 surgeries this fiscal year to meet the four-year target that was set. Once the renovations are complete and less complex surgeries are being performed in chartered surgical facilities, up to 30,000 additional surgeries will be available to Albertans by 2023.

At approximately noon, RCMP officers were called to a residence in the Porter Creek neighbourhood to respond to a complaint involving a man armed with a firearm. Once on scene, police located a man in a Ford truck in front of a residence. A confrontation occurred and a single shot was discharged from an officer’s service weapon. The 54-year-old man, who was the lone occupant of the vehicle, was not injured and was arrested soon after without further incident. A .44-calibre rifle was recovered from the vehicle following the incident. There were no injuries to police or other civilians.
Pursuant to an agreement between the Yukon and Alberta governments, investigations of serious incidents involving Yukon RCMP are conducted by ASIRT.
ASIRT’s investigation will focus on the actions of police during this incident, while RCMP will maintain responsibility for the investigation into the initial complaint and the man’s subsequent actions. ASIRT investigators are asking anyone who witnessed this incident or may have photos or video to call ASIRT at 403-592-4306.
As ASIRT’s investigation is underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, which is interpreted to include incidents where officers may have fired upon a person, even

The bill proposes improvements to post-secondary education funding, implementing the outcomes-based funding approach to ensure taxpayers get as much value as possible for every dollar spent on the higher learning system. It also includes measures to level the playing field for Alberta tourism businesses and ensures K-12 education dollars go into the classroom.

“Bill 5 continues our government’s thoughtful and measured approach to fiscal responsibility. We’re ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent with great intention to provide sustainability in all levels of education and that those dollars are spent in the classroom where they’re needed. We are also doing our part to create a fair business environment for tourism in Alberta.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

The highlights of Bill 5 include:

Introducing an outcomes-based funding model for post-secondary education.
Requiring K-12 school boards to obtain ministerial approval before spending reserve funds.

Minister Schweitzer, Associate Minister Luan and Blood Tribe representatives at the announcement new funding for addiction treatment and policing on the Blood Tribe.

The Alberta government is providing up to $2.2 million per year to expand the Kottakinoona Awaahkapiiyaawa (Bringing the Spirit Home) safe withdrawal management site from six beds to 24. This means that over the next three years, 3,753 additional Indigenous Albertans will receive addiction services.

“Our government is proud to provide funding to help this innovative facility support Albertans in the fight against addiction. By creating more spaces, we give more people the opportunity to get on the path to health, wellness and long-term recovery. This is part of our promise to create a fully funded continuum of care for addiction treatment and recovery.”
Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions


“Bringing the Spirit Home is run by our community and designed for our community. This increased funding will first and foremost allow us to save lives and help more people in our community struggling with drug addiction. This funding is an important step to help address addiction and support recovery for those who need it most.”
Kevin Cowan, CEO, Kottakinoona Awaahkapiiyaawa (Bringing the Spirit Home)

The provincial government is also investing $13.6 million this year for the Blood Tribe Police Service and other Indigenous policing initiatives.
Provincial funding for Blood Tribe police is increasing by $480,000, which will go toward hiring five additional officers.

“Along with providing more access to treatment, we believe in a balanced approach to drug addiction that includes ensuring police have the ability to target criminals who prey on vulnerable Albertans by selling illicit drugs. This additional funding will allow Blood Tribe police to create five new positions and put those officers where they’re needed most.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


“The Blood Tribe Police Service has been anticipating these five new positions since they were identified by the Blood Tribe, Public Safety Canada and the Province of Alberta in July 2019. These much-needed positions will certainly add to the safety and security of the Blood Tribe. We look forward to the signatories of the tripartite agreement continuing to work together on a long-term funding arrangement.”
Kyle Melting Tallow, chief of police, Blood Tribe Police Service


“This is excellent news for Kainai First Nation and all of southern Alberta. For years, we have called for more addiction treatment services and supports in our communities. I’m proud that our government has listened and is investing in services that will save lives and help more Albertans on the road to recovery.”
Joseph Schow, MLA for Cardston-Siksika


“Our government has heard loud and clear the requests from First Nations and Métis leaders for additional treatment spaces and supports for their communities. Today’s announcement is another step towards improving treatment services and addressing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s calls to action.”
Rick Wilson, Minister of Indigenous Relations

Quick facts: Funding for Bringing the Spirit Home

This community-developed program provides a safe transition to addiction treatment and recovery services.
When paramedics respond to an overdose in the community, the client can choose to go to the nearest hospital or the safe withdrawal management site where they receive medical detox services and 24-hour clinical care for 10 to 14 days.
Those who choose to go to the site also have the option of attending the Kainai Transition Society to support their recovery and transition back into the community.
More than 150 people are currently on a wait-list to access the site.
The Government of Alberta is investing $140 million by 2023 to create a full continuum of treatment and supports for Albertans experiencing mental health and addictions issues.
	
This includes funding to treat an additional 4,000 people in publicly funded treatment spaces across Alberta.



Quick facts: Funding for Blood Tribe Police Service

New funding for the Blood Tribe Police Service is part of a $1.4 million increase in the province’s contribution to the First Nations Policing Program, which provides funding for three self-administered Indigenous police services in Alberta as well as RCMP positions in 21 participating communities.
Under this program, the Government of Alberta pays 48 per cent of policing costs in participating communities, with Public Safety Canada responsible for 52 per cent.
In 2020-21, Alberta will contribute $3.5 million to the Blood Tribe police.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




“Effective April 1, the Government of Alberta will no longer administer a child care accreditation system parallel to licensing. No other province in the country duplicates licensing and accreditation.
“Eliminating accreditation lets child care providers spend more time with kids and families. Child care centre operators and workers have been clear that the accreditation process added unnecessary red tape, causing workers to spend hundreds of hours on paperwork rather than focusing on care for children.
“The safety of our children continues to be our highest priority. That’s why licensing officers will continue to enforce safety rules and regulations in licensed child care centres and licensed family day homes. This has not and will not change. We will be reviewing the Child Care Licensing Act later this year, and these changes to accreditation will be taken into consideration.
“We are committed to supporting the people who work directly with children every day. Quality child care requires a dedicated and professional workforce, which will be maintained through wage top-ups. Child care programs that were participating in accreditation have worked hard to embed the highest standards into their everyday programming – and we are confident those high standards will be maintained.
“Through Budget 2019 and Budget 2020, this government has provided an additional $21 million to low-income parents through child care subsidies, making sure those who need it most can access the workforce or pursue their education.
“We are keeping the best elements of the accreditation program – fair wages for all certified child care staff and professional development fund – and rolling them out to all licensed child care programs.
“Finally, child care operators will continue to have access to the provincial curriculum or may choose to implement a child care curriculum that meets the needs of their communities.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




 
Ministers Schweitzer and Luan announce Lethbridge as a location for a new drug treatment court and more officers for ALERT.

Lethbridge will have the first drug treatment court outside of Edmonton and Calgary as part of a four-year investment of up to $20 million that will see drug treatment courts expanded to five additional sites across the province.
The government is also increasing funding for law enforcement initiatives to disrupt and dismantle organized crime with a $50-million budget increase to Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams (ALERT). A portion of this new funding will allow ALERT to expand regional organized crime units across the province, including four adding new investigators to the regional unit based in Lethbridge.

“Southern Alberta has had the highest increase in methamphetamine use across the province since 2012-2013 and trafficking in hard drugs such as meth and heroin in Lethbridge is nearly six times the national average. Our government will be opening a drug treatment court in Lethbridge to help keep southern Albertans safe by ensuring those struggling with addiction have access to treatment to prevent the cycle of re-offence. We are also providing law enforcement in southern Alberta with the tools they need to disrupt and dismantle the organized crime groups that traffic and supply the illegal drugs that fuel addiction and take a terrible toll on our communities.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


“Our government believes in a fair, firm and compassionate approach to improving addiction treatment services and supports in the province. This drug court is an important part of that work. These courts can have a profound impact on Albertans with addiction, and can help them on the road to recovery.”
Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions

Drug treatment court expansion
Drug treatment courts help break the cycle of addiction-related crime by giving people who commit non-violent offences access to judicially supervised treatment and recovery. Treatment is supplemented by frequent drug testing, incentives, sanctions and social services support.
New funding will help establish programs in Lethbridge and other yet-to-be-determined locations beginning in late 2021.

“The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute to respect for the law by imposing sanctions which include denouncing certain behaviour and deterring certain conduct. It also includes assisting in the rehabilitation of offenders – particularly those whose offences are motivated by an addiction to drugs. A drug treatment court that serves Lethbridge and area will assist in achieving these objectives and is a welcome addition to the courts of this region.”
Assistant Chief Judge Derek G. Redman


“This announcement is the realization of a long term vision to see drug courts expanded to additional communities in Alberta. I look forward to being instrumental in the development of these new courts and in particular the launch of this exciting initiative in Lethbridge.”
Grace Froese, manager, Edmonton Drug Treatment Court


“Drug courts will allow participants to repair their lives, reconnect with loved ones and find long-term recovery. I firmly believe if a drug court in Lethbridge had been available for my daughter all those years ago, her life would look very different. Perhaps all of the trauma she suffered would have been mitigated. We will never know for her, but I do know we now have the opportunity to positively impact the lives of others.”
Robin James, person with lived experience

Drug treatment courts have been operating in Edmonton since 2005 and Calgary since 2007, and part of the $20 million in additional funding is being used to double the total combined capacity of the two existing courts to about 80 participants a year.
ALERT expansion
ALERT is adding positions to regional organized crime units around the province – four of which will be added to an existing team of nine investigators based in Lethbridge.
This move will expand ALERT’s geographic reach in rural areas. It also creates opportunities for investigators from smaller law enforcement agencies to gain experience working on complex cases, which they take back to their respective organizations.

“The added resources and enhancement of our ALERT team in Lethbridge will create more opportunities for collaboration, intelligence-sharing, and provide a more versatile response to serious and organized crime in the region.”
Supt. Dwayne Lakusta, chief executive officer, Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams

The four new positions in Lethbridge will be filled by two members from the Blood Tribe Police Service, one from the Taber Police Service and one from the RCMP.
The Lethbridge area will also benefit from the creation of a new ALERT unit specifically targeting the supply and sale of methamphetamine and opioids.
The specialized new unit will be made up of two teams: one based in Edmonton and one in Calgary. ALERT will deploy the teams to help communities experiencing a sudden or severe increase in problems related to methamphetamine and opioid use, such as a spike in overdoses or drug-related crime.
Quick facts

In Alberta, meth use has increased by about 330 per cent between 2014-2018 and meth trafficking has increased roughly 215 per cent between 2014-2017. 
Every year, Lethbridge keeps rising on Maclean’s magazine’s list of Canada’s most dangerous places, and the increase has been attributed to a rise in drug crime and the subsequent crime that comes with illegal drug use – property crime and break and enters where people need money quickly to purchase drugs.
Southern Alberta has had the highest increase in meth use since 2012-2013 and trafficking in hard drugs such as meth and heroin in Lethbridge is nearly six times the national average.

As the first step in A Blueprint for Jobs, the province is extending its loan to the OWA by up to $100 million. This loan will bolster the association’s immediate reclamation efforts and generate up to 500 direct and indirect jobs in the oil services sector.

“Today’s investment is part of our Blueprint for Jobs. This taxpayer investment will create good-paying jobs while improving the environment. Actions like this will help to get Alberta back to work.”
Jason Kenney, Premier 


“We are getting Albertans back to work while staying true to our province’s reputation as a responsible resource developer. This loan will increase economic activity across our province and is an important step in addressing the pressing issue of oil and gas liabilities – particularly in rural Alberta.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy


“By staying on top of the orphaned well inventory, we’re helping to ensure a sustainable energy industry in Alberta. The Orphan Well Association continues to increase our efficiencies while also increasing the number of sites we are addressing. This loan will help us further these efforts while helping Alberta’s service sector and reducing the impact on affected landowners.”
Lars De Pauw, executive director, Orphan Well Association 

Government and the OWA are currently finalizing specific loan terms and conditions, including establishing a repayment schedule. Both parties have agreed that this investment will be completed before April 1, 2021.
The Blueprint for Jobs is a plan to bring jobs and investment back to Alberta and restore the province’s position as the best place in the country to live, work, start a business, and raise a family. The Government of Alberta is focused on creating jobs, growing the economy and getting Alberta back to work.
Quick facts

The loan extension will enable the OWA to:
decommission approximately 1,000 wells
start more than 1,000 environmental site assessments for reclamation
The Alberta government previously provided the OWA with a $235 million interest-free loan. The OWA began repaying the loan in 2019, using money received from industry through the annual Orphan Fund Levy.
In the coming weeks, government will be introducing a full suite of products, covering the entire lifecycle of wells from start to finish.

About the Orphan Well Association
The Orphan Well Association is an independent non-profit organization that operates under the delegated legal authority of the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER). The mandate of the OWA is to safely decommission orphan oil and gas wells, pipelines and production facilities, and restore the land as close to its original state as possible. Funding for the OWA comes primarily from the upstream oil and gas industry, through annual levies administered by the AER.
Key Terms
Inactive well: A well that has not been used for production, injection, or disposal for a specified amount of time – six months for high-risk wells, or 12 months for medium- and low- risk wells.
Orphan: A well, pipeline, or facility that does not have any legally responsible and/or financially able party to conduct abandonment and reclamation responsibilities.
Abandoned well: A well that is no longer needed to support oil and gas development and is permanently plugged, cut and capped according to Alberta Energy Regulator requirements.
Reclamation: The process of returning the site, as close as possible, to a state that’s equivalent to before it was disturbed. Companies are responsible for reclamation liability for 25 years, after which the liability reverts to the Crown.

The Fairness for Newcomers Office was established to remove the barriers associated with the assessment of foreign qualifications. Working with professional regulatory organizations, the office will support fairness for newcomers by ensuring registration practices are transparent, objective, impartial and fair.

“Getting Alberta back to work means making the most of everyone’s talents, including newcomers to Alberta. For too long we have seen immigrant doctors driving cabs, and engineers working in corner stores. That’s why our government is implementing the Fairness for Newcomers Action Plan. It started with the passage of the Fair Registration Practices Act. The opening of the Fairness for Newcomers office is the next step to breaking down barriers to the full economic inclusion of new Albertans.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Every year, hundreds of highly educated newcomers immigrate to Alberta and face unjust obstacles that prevent them from using their international training and education to get ahead. By fulfilling our platform commitment to open the new Fairness for Newcomers Office, we will enable Albertans to benefit from the entrepreneurial drive and skills of newcomers who will help grow our economy and get Albertans back to work.”
Jason Copping, Minister of Labour and Immigration


“The Government of Alberta’s commitment to provide timely and fair registration services to qualified professionals who are newcomers to the province is a direction CPA Alberta strongly endorses. These newcomers have a great deal to offer the province, and doing all we can to facilitate their success helps grow Alberta economically and socially. As a professional regulatory body, CPA Alberta is looking forward to working with the government in achieving the goals set for the Fairness for Newcomers Office.”
Rachel Miller, CEO, Chartered Professional Accountants of Alberta


“We heard from people across the province how unnecessary barriers were negatively affecting newcomers in having their credentials recognized. The launch of the Fairness for Newcomers Office is a clear indication that our government is serious about welcoming newcomers, getting Albertans back to work, and working collaboratively with our provincial regulatory associations.” 
Muhammad Yaseen, Parliamentary Secretary of Immigration

Quick facts

According to the Conference Board of Canada, Canadians would earn up to $17 billion more annually if their learning credentials were fully recognized.
Provinces such as Ontario, Manitoba and Nova Scotia already have fairness legislation to ensure professional regulatory organizations have fair registration practices.

Through campaigns such as the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation and Sexual Violence Awareness Month, we are providing Albertans with the knowledge and tools to end violence against women.
“We are also celebrating and supporting women in the workplace, and investing in programs such as Women Building Futures to create more opportunities for women in non-traditional fields. Alberta is home to an incredible number of women who are leaders and innovators in business. I was proud to declare Nov. 19, 2019, Women’s Entrepreneurship Day.
“The theme of Zero Discrimination Day 2020 speaks to how race, culture, faith and gender overlap to create barriers for diverse groups to fully participate in our world. We will continue working with everyone in Alberta to continue to build a province where all people can fully participate and contribute.
“In an ideal world, all people can pursue their dreams, provide for their families, and feel safe and welcome in every space. Working together, we can make progress to achieve this vision.”

“The French were among the first Europeans in Alberta. Almost 2,000 communities and historic sites in Alberta have names derived from French settlement. Some communities are officially bilingual, such as Beaumont, Legal, Falher and Plamondon.
“French is more than one of Canada’s two official languages. It is the most widely spoken language in Alberta after English. It is a symbol of Alberta’s diversity, vibrancy and future vision. The descendants of francophone Albertans and immigrants from French-speaking cultures are still building and shaping Alberta, and continue to brighten our future.
“This month, let’s show our French-speaking neighbours that we value their history, their contributions, their culture and their ability to help strengthen our relationship with the Francophonie across Canada and the world.”

Changes to the Alberta Parks system will allow government to focus its energy on renowned signature destinations and examine opportunities for other groups to operate smaller parks and day-use areas.

“Albertans have expressed an interest in taking a more active role in the operation of some areas traditionally run by the province. In order to facilitate this, and to renew our commitment to our ‘crown jewel’ destinations, we will be offering Albertans, non-profits and First Nations the opportunity to work with our government and with parks societies on exploring these important partnerships.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

Government undertook an assessment of all sites in the Alberta Parks system and identified 164 of its 473 sites – 0.3 per cent of the Alberta Parks land base – for proposed removal from the system.
Sites identified are mainly small and under-utilized provincial recreation areas that would become vacant public land. Work is underway to determine if some of these facilities and areas could stay open under a public lands management model. Through prospective sale or transfer to First Nations or entities such as a municipality or non-profit, these sites could continue to provide important economic and recreational benefits to local communities.
Implementing the changes will support a renewed vision for nature-based visitor experiences to lands of high recreation, conservation, tourism and education value.

“Our government has a bold vision for the tourism industry, and opening up more facilities and areas for First Nations, non-profit and private sector operation is a great way to encourage private sector investment and create jobs across Alberta as we implement our 10-year tourism strategy.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism

In its platform, government committed to review Environment and Parks legislation to modernize it for the 21st century, including the Alberta Parks system. Revenue from Alberta Parks service fees in 2018-19 was $33.4 million. The revenue is directed back into the parks system to support operations which, in the same fiscal year, cost government $86.1 million.
Additional changes to support a more effective and efficient parks system include closing or partially closing 20 sites this year and increasing camping service fees. The base camping rate at most campgrounds will rise by $3 and rates for power, water, sewers and showers will increase by $1 where services are available. Service fees in provincial campgrounds have not increased since 2016. Access to provincial parks and day use areas remains free.
With the camping season just around the corner, online reservations open March 10 for comfort camping, March 17 for individual campsites and March 24 for group camping. Online bookings open at 9 a.m. for each launch and can be made at Reserve.AlbertaParks.ca.
Starting this year, Reserve.AlbertaParks.ca will be available 365 days, allowing for consistent and easy access to year-round Alberta Parks’ camping reservations.
Changes to the parks system, where applicable to online reservations, will be captured on the website.
More information will be available in early May 2020 for people interested in pursuing alternate management approaches with the Government of Alberta.

“Each year, on the last day in February, we recognize Rare Disease Day – an important day for many families. About one in 12 Canadians are affected by a rare disease and two-thirds of those affected are children.
“It can take months or even years to reach diagnosis of a rare disease. Following diagnosis, the next steps often are multiple and exhausting: specialist appointments, surgeries and procedures accompanied by high levels of anxiety and heartache for the affected family.
“We are blessed in Alberta with an outstanding medical system with highly trained specialists. Their commitment and compassion to care for patients with rare diseases helps families cope with the burden of diagnosis and improves lives.
“My thanks and appreciation go to Alberta’s medical researchers and practitioners who help improve the quality of life for many people with rare diseases – here and around the world. In turn, they have learned from others to make a better life for all.”

Coverage for Kalydeco was first made available in 2014 to patients six years and older with cystic fibrosis who have one specific genetic mutation. This coverage will be expanded to include patients six years and older who have one of an additional eight genetic mutations. Coverage will also be provided to adult Albertans with cystic fibrosis who have one particular genetic mutation.

“The impact and severity of this rare disease can be significant. We welcome this opportunity to provide Albertans with more treatment options and an improved quality of life. As we recognize Rare Disease Day, it is a fitting time to acknowledge the importance of treatment to those with a rare disease with expanded support for Albertans affected by cystic fibrosis.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“We have called for provincial governments to expand coverage of Kalydeco for years and so we applaud today’s announcement in Alberta. People living with cystic fibrosis in Canada need access to life-changing medications and Cystic Fibrosis Canada will continue to fight with our community for needed access.”
Kelly Grover, CEO, Cystic Fibrosis Canada

Budget 2020 maintains the health budget at record levels, including $2.2 billion budgeted for Drugs and Supplemental Benefits. Government is refocusing how dollars are spent to make sure services get to the people they’re meant to serve.
Quick facts

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that primarily affects the digestive system and lungs. The degree of severity differs from person to person; however, it is often fatal.
Beginning March 1, coverage for Kalydeco will be provided to children six years and older with cystic fibrosis who have one of the following genetic mutations: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N and S549R.
Patients age 18 and older with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene will also be provided with coverage for this medication.
The pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance successfully negotiated a pricing agreement with the manufacturer of this prescription drug for expanded coverage.

Premier Jason Kenney and Finance Minister Travis Toews present the 2020 Budget: A Plan for Jobs and the Economy.

Third-quarter results show the deficit has declined more than expected. With the deficit $1.2 billion lower than projected in Budget 2019, Alberta taxpayers can expect to pay $35 million less in debt-servicing costs.
Budget 2020 also provides stable funding for health, education and core social services. The budget focuses on finding cost efficiencies and creating jobs while maintaining the high-quality services Albertans expect.

“Budget 2020 continues our focus on creating jobs, growing our economy and streamlining programs and services to ensure a sustainable future. Our plan is working. We are on track to balance the budget by 2022-23 and Alberta’s surplus in that year is expected to be higher than that projected in Budget 2019. We are also maintaining funding for health and education while ensuring each dollar is wisely spent on what Albertans need most.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

Included in Budget 2020 is A Blueprint for Jobs – the government’s plan to get Albertans back to work. It supports dynamic growth from the technology, energy, agriculture and forestry sectors and supports diversification in other key sectors through initiatives, including:

Improving competitiveness through further reductions in the Job Creation Tax Cut.
Accelerating growth-oriented projects through the capital plan to provide job opportunities for Albertans.
Reducing red tape in all sectors to make Alberta the best place to do business in Canada.
Accelerating the reclamation of “legacy sites” – including orphan wells – in ways that prioritize job creation.


Filling gaps in the labour market, such as increasing access to training for Class 1 drivers.


“There is no greater job for our government than getting Alberta back to work. Budget 2020 and A Blueprint for Jobs leverage the natural strengths of our province and support new opportunities for diversification, economic growth and job creation. We are putting a growth and prosperity lens on everything we do to ensure the choices we make as a government support economic growth and jobs for Albertans.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

Budget 2020 capital plan highlights
The 2020 Capital Plan commits $6.9 billion in 2020-21 to build and maintain key infrastructure projects across the province. Over the course of the three-year fiscal plan, an estimated $772 million in new projects will be added, bringing the total capital plan to $19.3 billion. This will create opportunities for private sector participation and support more than 3,000 jobs, increasing employment by 2022. Some of the new projects include:

Twinning Highway 40 to facilitate economic growth and improve safety.
Funding to renovate the Peter Lougheed Centre to alleviate pressure on Alberta’s most-congested emergency department.
New funding for critical laboratory equipment needs in Edmonton and northern Alberta.
The Alberta Surgical Wait-Times Initiative, which will fund new operating rooms and purchase new hospital equipment. The initiative will reduce Alberta’s surgical wait times to an average of four months, funding 80,000 additional surgeries by 2022-23.
The launch of a new Rural Health Facilities Revitalization Program to provide infrastructure upgrades across Alberta.
Funding for the Red Deer Integrated Emergency Shelter for 160 new spaces for the homeless.
Funding for the Bow Reservoir Options project to assess the feasibility of a multi-use dam on the Bow River.

Bill 4, also tabled today, implements a fixed budget period. This provision is an amendment to the Fiscal Planning and Transparency Act and aligns with a recommendation from the MacKinnon Panel.
A fixed budget period will help organizations that provide services for Albertans to better plan their own budgets. The fixed budget period means a budget must be released each year in the month of February.

Check against delivery
Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour to rise today in this house and table this government’s budget for 2020.
This budget continues the responsible four-year fiscal plan that started with Budget 2019, a plan to get Albertans working, to make life better, and the pledge to boldly stand up for Alberta.
Albertans overwhelmingly endorsed our commitment to eliminate the largest deficit in our province’s history and bring government’s finances back into balance.
I am pleased to share that we are on track to eliminate the deficit. In fact, our deficit is $1.2 billion lower than we projected in Budget 2019. This means that Alberta taxpayers will pay $35 million less in debt servicing costs.
Getting to a balanced budget will provide a solid fiscal foundation from which Albertans can confidently face the future and seize its opportunities.
A balanced budget means that millions – and then billions – of dollars in interest payments to bankers and bondholders can be diverted to the services Albertans need.
In short, my goal as finance minister – my motivation – is to lay a strong fiscal foundation for economic prosperity for this generation and those to come.
To eliminate the deficit by 2022, this budget continues with the plan to reduce government operational spending by less than 3 per cent. More importantly, it includes modernizing the way services are delivered, ensuring that Albertans are getting full value for their tax dollars.
It includes re-profiling expenditures to ensure that we are providing for the most vulnerable.
And it will ensure the sustainability of public services into the future.
Since 2014, many Albertans have been out of work. Today’s unemployment rate is over seven per cent and there has not been a business, a community, or a family that has been untouched by this crisis. 
From the very start, even before we were elected, we made jobs our number one priority, and not by growing government. Albertans know that government does not create wealth or prosperity.
Government policies can either support growth or impede it, but they cannot create it. A robust economy and real wealth creation is built on the effort, investment, and ambition of citizens and businesses.
Government’s role is to provide a business environment that is nimble, predictable, and one where there’s a high correlation between effort, risk, and reward.
Alberta’s history is full of remarkable stories of innovators and mavericks, risk-takers, and determined, hard working people from all walks of life drawn to the boundless opportunities our province offers.
The freedom to pursue dreams and the common sense work ethic of the people is how Alberta became the magnet for entrepreneurs and investment, and earned the reputation as the wealth and job creation engine of the nation.
I am pleased to present in this budget A Blueprint for Jobs. This blueprint will support our key sectors of energy, agriculture, and forestry where we’re naturally strong, and leverage our advantages to support sustainable economic diversification, innovation, and business attraction in technology, aviation, and the financial and tourism sectors.
Our government will move quickly to evolve the blueprint as goals are met and as new opportunities emerge. This plan will form the basis of a relentless, cross-government focus to support economic growth and job creation.
In Budget 2020, we’re continuing to take a broad-based approach to taxation where government doesn’t pick winners and losers, but instead creates a competitive business environment where capital flows freely without government prejudice or bias.
To that end, we are cutting business taxes and red tape, balancing labour laws, freeing up interprovincial trade and refocusing Alberta’s international offices on investment attraction.
Alberta now has a 10 per cent corporate tax rate, down from 12 per cent when we took office. That’s the lowest in the country, and when we reach eight per cent in 2022, it will be one of the lowest in North America.
CNRL cited the job creation tax cut and the curtailment exemption for new drills from the conventional basin as reasons for its planned drilling activity increase in 2020.
Alberta’s credit unions support our decision to lower corporate taxes as these reductions allow them to increase investment in their local communities and lend more to Albertans seeking to build the province.
Economists have consistently shown that tax reductions combined with regulatory certainty lead to economic growth and job creation. Budget 2020 continues with this approach and we expect more positive investment announcements to come.
We’ve brought back common sense labour laws that provide balance to both employers and workers, but we’re not done yet.
We will use public input from the online engagement last fall to revisit how Alberta’s labour laws should address vacation time, holiday pay, youth employment rules, and where and how employment standards should apply.
Expanding our economy starts with expanding trade, and that starts right here in Canada.
Alberta is leading by example in opening provincial borders to trade, and so far, we’ve removed more than 80 per cent of our exceptions under the Canadian Free Trade Agreement.
We continue to call on all other provinces and territories to make Canada a true economic union and show the world that Canada is open for business and investment.
Like provincial borders, red tape is also a barrier to economic growth, one that we are tackling head-on with real economic benefits.
We are clearing the backlog of grazing leases waiting for approval by extending 20-year leases for ranchers who go above and beyond environmental standards.
We passed the Farm Safety and Freedom Act, which cuts red tape and provides common sense exemptions from the labour code while ensuring basic safety standards on all farms.
We have reduced delays for forest-management agreements that support forestry jobs and ensure the best environmental and resource-management outcomes.
And our work is being recognized. In January of this year, nine months after taking office, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business gave Alberta a B- up from an F on red tape reduction.
While we have a good start, a B- is not good enough. Much work remains. Budget 2020 continues the commitment to cut red tape by one-third.
Budget 2020 allocates $75 million over three years to focus the work of Alberta’s international offices on investment attraction, cross-sector coordination, and focused marketing. We need the world to know the many business opportunities that exist in Alberta and that our actions back our claims: that we’re open for business.
Indigenous communities have tremendous potential as they take their rightful role in the economy.
Budget 2020 provides up to $1 billion to the new Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation to backstop Indigenous equity investment and ownership of major energy infrastructure projects.
Mr. Speaker, Alberta has a world-class energy resource and an industry that reflects the value of the asset. We are global leaders in energy exploration, production, transportation, and environmental technology. Our energy industry has been the primary driver in our economy, and the economy of the nation.
Getting energy to market is key to our prosperity. While we’re pleased that work is underway on the Trans Mountain Pipeline, we are pressing the federal government to get firm guarantees on the completion date, and assurance that the rule of law will be swiftly enforced in the event of illegal protests.
And TransMountain is not the only pipeline at play. With plans to optimize existing pipelines, the anticipated completion of Enbridge’s line 3, and TC Energy’s planned resumption of Keystone XL, additional export capacity is inching forward.
And speaking about pipelines, I want to be clear. This government will do everything in its power to ensure pipelines necessary for economic growth and job creation are built as quickly as possible.
Until then, we will be looking for increased crude shipments by rail. We have off-loaded to the private sector all of the crude by rail capacity the previous government irresponsibly committed Albertans to, and we’re expecting rail shipments to exceed 500,000 barrels per day in the near term.
Since forming government, we have fought hard for the natural gas sector, working with industry to improve coordination in shipping and maintenance protocols, which has led to increased prices and price stability.
There remains great growth potential for energy. The world will need fossil fuel energy for decades to come, and Alberta, with its energy sector committed to environmental and social excellence, is the rational place to produce it.
To that end, we will highlight to the world Alberta’s best-Fin-class environmental, social, and governance credentials through initiatives, including those of the Canadian Energy Centre, to maintain confidence of investors and ensure jobs in Alberta are defended.
We are seeking federal approval of flow-through shares or other tax instruments to further increase job creating investment in environmental activities. This would create jobs by increasing reclamation of abandoned oil and gas wells.
But we are not sitting on our hands while we wait for a federal response. Our government will increase our loan to the Orphan Well Association. This investment is expected to create hundreds of jobs in regions where they’re badly needed, and result in a significant increase in the reclamation of abandoned sites.
Mr. Speaker, while this government is a staunch supporter of our energy industry and believes it has great potential for additional growth, we are also on track for continued economic diversification.
Diversification starts in the energy industry itself. Budget 2020 continues government’s $1.1 billion commitment to the Petrochemical Diversification Program that turns ethane, methane, and propane into plastics, fabrics, and fertilizers.
Continuing the program encourages a sector that has a great future in Alberta, with low-cost feedstocks, a talented work force, and essential infrastructure.
And Alberta energy is more than oil and gas. Renewable energy is a growth opportunity and industry is responding.
Two companies, Calgary-based BHE Canada and Suncor Energy, are investing half a billion dollars in wind and solar power projects.
In fact, after we returned Alberta to an energy-only market, private companies have announced more than $2.7 billion in various electrical generation projects. 
Further to the environment, our government will work with industry to continue reducing the environmental impact of our energy production.
Our Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction program – or TIER – puts the cost of reducing emissions where it belongs, on large industrial emitters, instead of on the shoulders of families and seniors. More than that, the TIER program will support new GHG reduction technologies that have real potential to cut global emissions.
Agriculture in this province has been an integral part of its history and heritage.
George Lane, one of Alberta’s most distinguished and innovative cattlemen at the turn of the 20th century and a founding member of the Calgary Stampede, had an unshakeable confidence in the future of western Canada and a vision of Alberta as the greatest farming and ranching region in the world.
It’s said his vision had a considerable effect on immigration and investment. And I would echo his unshakeable confidence today. 
Our farms and ranches are global leaders in innovative production practices and the use of technology, resulting in high quality, competitively priced, and globally trusted products – products that are produced with less energy, less water, fewer acres, and lower emissions.
Food and beverage processing provided jobs to more than 26,000 Albertans in 2018, making it the province’s largest manufacturing employer.
A Blueprint for Jobs seeks to attract $1.4 billion in investment to grow agriculture and food exports over the next four years. This will create 2,000 jobs and grow the sector by eight per cent per year.
Technology is increasingly a foundation of Alberta’s economy. Our primary sectors such as energy and agriculture have driven technological advancements and are, in turn, sustained by ongoing innovation.
Alberta is home to one of three Canadian artificial intelligence hubs, and the AI ecosystem has seen an incredible upswing in growth with the attraction of research labs and an increased number of AI start-ups. 
We know that the start-up companies of today are the job creating industries of tomorrow. To that end, Budget 2020 provides more than $200 million to support research, innovation, and commercialization to develop and advance talent, and to help drive global investment.
This funding will support growth in AI and machine learning, aviation, and aerospace, and the finance and fintech sectors. We will work with our entrepreneurs and those with a bold vision for Alberta’s future to ensure that government programs, including this funding, are supporting commercialization, attracting talent to Alberta, and establishing long-term jobs for Albertans.
Another industry with immense potential is tourism. In fact, tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in the world with global traveller expenditures expected to double in the coming decade.
A Blueprint for Jobs includes development of a ten-year tourism strategy to support our goal of doubling tourism spending in Alberta to $20 billion by 2030. 
A Blueprint for Jobs also includes an infrastructure approach that puts a focus on long-term job creation.
Over the next three years, we will invest an average of $6.4 billion per year building schools, health care facilities, roads, and other infrastructure Albertans need.
To accelerate job creation, government will work with industry and municipalities to identify and prioritize strategic transportation corridors for development that will improve productivity, attract investment, and support economic growth. Analysis is underway to identify investments that support job creation both in their construction phase and into the future.
While there’s much work to do on the jobs front, there are reasons for optimism. 
Canada has a new free trade agreement within North America, and we call on the federal government to ratify the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement as soon as possible.
Economic uncertainty in Europe is easing with Brexit clarity.
Trade relations between the United States and China, which stoked fears of a global recession last year, are improving.
The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers is projecting a $2-billion increase in Canadian energy investment in 2020, which signals the first increase in oil sands investment since 2014.
Alberta is on track to lead the country in economic growth over the next two years. Real GDP growth is forecast to rebound to 2.5 per cent in 2020 and average just under three per cent between 2021 and 2023.
But we know there are still risks out there. As the coronavirus is affecting communities across the globe, we’re seeing the impacts of decreased economic activity in the financial markets.
That is why we are focused on what we can control – creating an attractive business environment and restraining spending.
While we work to expand our economic capacity to increase job opportunities for Albertans, we are also making overdue changes to modernize and streamline the delivery of public services.
The MacKinnon Panel found that Alberta’s spending per capita is the highest in Canada, and has been for the last 25 years.
We would be spending $10.4 billion less every year if our per capita spending simply matched the average of British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.
And our higher spending hasn’t bought better results.
Budget 2020 keeps our four-year fiscal plan on track to move our per capita spending levels in line with Canada’s largest provinces, with a clear focus on achieving results.
We made a commitment to Albertans that we would not cut health care or education spending and we have kept our promise. Budget 2020 maintains health spending while taking meaningful action to improve the health care system.
The recently released Ernst & Young AHS review identified a number of opportunities to reduce costs while improving system performance, with all savings reinvested into front line services. 
Over the next three years, AHS will implement the Alberta Surgical Wait-Times Initiative that includes contracting with independent surgical providers, with a goal to perform an additional 80,000 surgeries by 2023 and dramatically reduce wait times.
Funding for a new mental health and addiction strategy will provide hope to those caught in the cycle of substance abuse. As outlined in Budget 2019, we will deploy funding for up to 4,000 additional addiction and mental health treatment spaces. 
A new funding model in Education will provide school boards with the flexibility and, more importantly, the predictability they have been seeking.
The new formula better manages student growth, streamlines the large number of grants to reduce duplication, simplifies reporting, and directs funding to the classroom instead of administration.
As our students transition from high school to post-secondary there will be a focus on programs that result in good tangible careers.
A new outcomes-focused funding model for post-secondary education will provide base support to institutions, and then top that up with performance-based incentives.
Budget 2020 continues new training opportunities to prepare students and adults for lucrative jobs in the skilled trades, with funding to Skills Canada Alberta, Women Building Futures, new veterans and trades scholarships, and doubling of the number of schools that work with CAREERS the Next Generation.
These skills will be necessary as the economy picks up, and as a large segment of the population retires over the next 10 years.
There are currently thousands of available jobs in transport truck driving in Alberta even while thousands of Albertans remain unemployed. A Blueprint for Jobs will make new tools available to make a career as a Class 1 truck driver more attainable.
Our government committed to better protect rural Albertans from crime, trespassing, and vandalism.
A new Police Funding Model will support our fight against rural crime by putting hundreds of new RCMP and civilian positions in rural communities. We are funding 50 new prosecutors and expanding drug treatment courts to mitigate the cycle of addiction-related crime.
Budget 2020 will also introduce a number of modernization initiatives to reduce costs in the justice system.
We are moving away from paper records to digital forms and e-Courts to save nearly one million court visits, two million hours and over $400 million dollars in the first five years. This will result in improved justice capacity and the ability to focus resources on the front lines.
We committed to support Alberta’s most vulnerable and Budget 2020 keeps us on track.
Funding for Children’s Services will increase nearly 10 per cent by 2023 and will assist in ensuring children have an opportunity to grow up in a safe and caring home. 
Community and Social Services will provide $11.7 billion over the next three years caring for adults and families in need of support, people with disabilities, and the homeless.
2020 will mark an important year in implementation of the MacKinnon Panel recommendations. The panel found that Alberta has the highest total per capita compensation for all public sector jobs compared to other large provinces.
Mr. Speaker, you cannot discuss a balanced budget without discussing public sector compensation. More than half of taxpayer dollars in Alberta are spent on staffing. It’s our largest single expense.
Since 2015, the public sector grew by more than 10,000 full-time equivalent positions, and salaries grew by an average of 2.3 per cent per year.
Albertans simply cannot afford this. Alberta can no longer afford to be the outlier in the nation. Therefore, this government is acting on MacKinnon Panel recommendations to bring public sector compensation in line with comparable provinces.
We have a goal to reduce the overall cost of public sector staffing by 2.1 per cent over three years. 
This is both responsible and fair, and respects the realities of those working outside the public service. More importantly, it will ensure our ability to deliver the high quality services that Albertans expect now and in the future.
That means that as collective bargaining begins with unions that represent 270,000 public sector workers, there is no money for pay increases.
So again, I ask the nurses and teachers and the dedicated professionals who serve Albertans everyday – work with us as partners to ensure a sustainable future for our public sector and the high-quality services you deliver.
Mr. Speaker, for many years Alberta has been the economic engine of the nation. We have made a massive contribution to the national economy and to Canadians’ standard of living by adding $100 billion to the national treasury in the last five years alone.
Over that same time frame, however, adverse market conditions have been made worse by federal policies that have created uncertainty, damaged conditions for investment, and otherwise hindered the province’s economic recovery. 
During this most difficult period for the province in a generation, our contributions to Canada have not been reciprocated. Alberta is seeking a fair deal to address this imbalance. 
The Fair Deal Panel is listening to people across the province regarding a new arrangement for Alberta within Canada and will report back to our government this spring.
While we are challenged with our current federal government, we do have a growing number of provincial allies on issues important to Alberta.
With decisive leadership from our Premier, nine out of 10 provinces are supportive of energy and resource corridors.
Nine out of 10 premiers share our opposition to Bill C-69, the “no more pipelines” law. And most provinces have joined us in opposing the federal carbon tax. 
And on our request for a retroactive $2.4 billion fiscal stabilization payment, Alberta has the support of all 10 provinces.
After the federal election in October, the Prime Minister offered words of concern for the west and in support of national unity. Unfortunately, they’ve only been words and Albertans need to see real action.
So I call on our federal government to unequivocally and tangibly support growth in the Canadian energy industry, and our fair request for a retroactive fiscal stabilization payment.
Mr. Speaker, balancing the budget is critically important for our future as a province, but Budget 2020 is more than that.
It’s about continuing the intentional direction set in Budget 2019, a direction that’s grounded in responsibility and confidence.
It’s about delivering public services to Albertans in a more modern, cost effective, and sustainable manner, so they are available for future generations.
It’s about laying a foundation for the future – a foundation for economic growth, prosperity, and opportunity. 
And once again, I make a commitment to all Albertans that this government will work relentlessly to create job opportunities, and to get a fair deal for Alberta in Confederation.
Mr. Speaker, there are signs that in 2020 we will turn a corner and see real economic growth return to the Alberta economy. We are on track to balance the budget. We are on track to bring investment, and jobs back to Alberta. We are on track to transform service delivery and to protect the most vulnerable.
Albertans are resourceful, responsible, forward looking and hopeful. Together we will achieve a strong, prosperous, and compassionate Alberta.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Speech delivered by:
Honourable Travis Toews
President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance
Legislative Assembly of Alberta

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Bill 2 proposes five amendments to the Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Act to modernize a number of Alberta’s liquor laws.

“These amendments are a clear signal that we are serious about making sure Alberta has an open and modern regulatory system. These amendments will have a positive effect on municipalities and licensees by eliminating unnecessary processes and getting rid of cumbersome rules.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction

The amendments include providing a single, streamlined process for municipalities and Metis Settlements to respond to an application for a liquor licence in a community that does not already have one. They will also reduce restrictions on liquor consumption in parks and allow municipalities to determine whether public consumption in their parks will be allowed.

“AGLC is committed to working with industry partners to continue to bring forward policy changes that support business development. While innovation is the driving force behind the amendments, AGLC remains committed to offering responsible choices that Albertans can trust, while maintaining a regulatory environment that remains effective in reducing social harms.”
Alain Maisonneuve, president & CEO, AGLC

Government will continue to review and modernize legislation, regulations and policy as part of the ongoing commitment to reduce red tape, and additional action will soon be taken to further improve the regulations surrounding Alberta’s liquor laws.

“Our members are pleased to see more improvements and look forward to continuing to work in cooperation with AGLC and the province on Alberta’s ongoing modernization of liquor laws. This is why Alberta got top marks in our Raise the Bar Report.”
Mark von Schellwitz, vice-president, Western Canada, Restaurants Canada

Daryl Mahoney, AEMA walks Minister Madu and Deputy Minister Paul Wynnyk through EMX 20 at the Provincial Operations Centre.

This year’s exercise – known as Emergency Management Exercise 2020 or EMX 20 – is a realistic simulation of multiple tornadoes affecting the Edmonton, Red Deer and Calgary areas. When one or more devastating tornadoes occur, a ‘whole of society’ response is needed. All levels of government, municipalities, emergency management professionals, Indigenous groups, industry and non-government organizations are involved.

“As leaders in emergency management, we regularly practise and prepare for emergencies and disasters. EMX 20 is an opportunity for us to bring government staff and emergency management partners together over a three-day period to strengthen our emergency response efforts. During real disasters and emergencies, these dedicated individuals are there 24-7 to help keep us safe and up-to-date with the latest information.”
Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs

During EMX 20, emergency management professionals have the opportunity to simulate responses to various challenges that arise during and after a major emergency. They will practise working together, confirm their organizations’ roles and responsibilities, and test their response procedures. Exercise participants will be at the Provincial Operations Centre Feb. 26-28.

“EPCOR is eager to participate in this important exercise that will help us be better prepared to deal with a real water emergency if we are ever faced with one. Emergency preparedness is an important part in public health protection and delivery of safe drinking water.”
Steve Craik, director, EPCOR Water Canada Quality Assurance and Environment

Disasters in Alberta have increased over the years. Emergency management exercises are vital to ensuring the Government of Alberta and its community partners respond effectively when emergencies and disasters occur. Albertans are encouraged to practise their own emergency preparation, as disasters can occur with little to no warning. Here are a few tips on how to be prepared:

sign up to receive Alberta emergency alerts
build and maintain emergency kits
have an emergency plan in place and practise that plan with your family
review your insurance coverage with your provider to ensure that you have sufficient coverage to protect your family and property

Quick facts:

Emergency management exercises have been held annually in Alberta since 2001.
The Provincial Operations Centre is part of Alberta’s emergency management system and mitigates, prepares for, responds to, and helps recovery during emergencies and disasters. The centre is staffed 24-7.
Alberta’s emergency management system is designed to protect life, property, and the environment by providing a unified, coordinated and resilient response to emergencies.

Premier Jason Kenney and Indigenous Relations Minister Rick Wilson greet Woodland Cree First Nation Chief Isaac Laboucan-Avirom.

Woodland Cree First Nation, northwest of Peace River, will receive a $187,688 grant to intervene in support of the Alberta government’s constitutional challenge of Bill C-69, the Impact Assessment Act.

“I am pleased to work with Chief Isaac Laboucan-Avirom of the Woodland Cree First Nation to announce the latest steps in enhancing the voices of First Nations in Alberta to stand up for their own interests. The Indigenous Litigation Fund will help Indigenous communities protect their legal right to participate in and benefit from the development of the resources underneath the lands they have called home for generations.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

The $10-million Indigenous Litigation Fund backs Indigenous-led legal action challenging federal legislation that hinders major energy projects in Alberta. It also presents a new way for the provincial and Indigenous governments to strengthen their relationships.

“With today’s announcement, we see the completion of a promise made and promise kept. The Indigenous Litigation Fund will support responsible resource development to move forward and, more importantly, ensure Indigenous voices are heard in standing up for Alberta.”
Rick Wilson, Minister of Indigenous Relations

For many Indigenous communities in Alberta, responsible natural resource development presents an important economic stream to keep people working and funds flowing back to support community-level social and economic programs.
Quick facts

The Indigenous Litigation Fund is a government commitment to help groups with Indigenous membership voice their support for resource development. Potential applicants are now able to apply for seed funding for research into potential court challenges.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




On Feb. 26, the Alberta government is running a digital campaign to recognize Pink Shirt Day and raise awareness of bullying and the resources available through #WhereToTurn. Pink Shirt Day began in 2007 when a student in Nova Scotia was bullied for wearing a pink shirt to school. It has since been recognized around the world as a day to stand up against bullying.
Wearing a pink shirt on Feb. 26 is a way to show your support for Pink Shirt Day and send the message that bullying behaviours will not be tolerated. Bullying can occur in the workplace, school, home or community.

“We all have a responsibility to address bullying when we see it happen. This Pink Shirt Day, we are working with communities across Alberta to promote healthy relationships and spread awareness of the services available to those in need.”
Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services


“Our government supports safe schools that are free from bullying and prejudice, and we encourage everyone to join us in wearing pink on Feb. 26 to support Pink Shirt Day. Wearing pink shows the importance of promoting healthy relationships and actively working towards creating learning and work environments that are safe and free from bullying.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

The Alberta government’s Pink Shirt Day focuses on a wide range of year-round supports and services available to people experiencing and witnessing acts of bullying. These include:

the Bullying Helpline (1-888-456-2323), an anonymous helpline available 24-7 in more than 170 languages
the Bullying Helpline Chat, available 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily at alberta.ca/bullyingchat

This diluent recovery unit (DRU), to be built at the Hardisty rail terminal, will increase Alberta’s takeaway capacity. Prior to loading onto rail cars, the DRU technology will remove diluent from blended bitumen, freeing up rail car capacity for additional oil. The recovered diluent will be reused by upstream oil sands producers.
Government’s approval allows the project to proceed to the next stages of development, including additional environmental approvals, before construction can begin.

“Approving this project demonstrates our government’s commitment to supporting innovative technology and enhancing our reputation as a leader in responsible energy development. Projects like this attract new investment, create jobs and strengthen our energy industry.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy

Before being submitted for government approval, these development plans – also known as schemes – require stringent review by the Alberta Energy Regulator.
Quick facts

The project is located just outside of Hardisty, about 200 kilometres southeast of Edmonton.
This project will have the capacity to process up to 100,000 barrels of bitumen blend per day.
Gibson Energy estimates the project could be operational as early as the second quarter of 2021.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




This separate and independent board provides Albertans, conservation groups and industry the opportunity to appeal certain decisions made by Environment and Parks under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act and other legislation.

“The board oversees appeals and ensures fair process for all Albertans, so it’s important that we choose members who are experienced and will act in the best interest of the public and the province. With these individuals, I am confident we have achieved exactly that. I am pleased to announce these appointments and I trust all members will continue to use their expertise to support and inform the board’s recommendations.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

The board was created more than 25 years ago and hears appeals relating to environmental approvals, water licences, enforcement orders, reclamation and remediation certificates, administrative penalties and environmental protection orders.
Members were chosen by the Public Agency Secretariat following a recruitment process. Board members are generally reappointed for a two- to three-year term, and new board members are normally appointed for a one- to two-year term.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




 
Premier Jason Kenney reacts to the Alberta Court of Appeal ruling on the carbon tax.

“Today is a great victory for Alberta and for Canadian federalism. We promised Albertans we would fight for them, and today we succeeded.
“We will not tolerate Ottawa determining the future of Alberta’s economy. This consumer carbon tax is now illegal, therefore we expect the Government of Canada to comply with the order of the court today, remove the federal carbon tax on Albertans and immediately refund any and all tax collected to date.
“The provinces are best situated to make policy decisions for their own citizens. The 'Ottawa-knows-best' attitude of the federal government disrupts the constitutional balance of our federation and undermines our right to manage our own affairs.
“In their decision, the Court of Appeal called the effort to impose this punishing tax on families filling up their gas tanks and heating their homes a ‘constitutional Trojan horse.’
“Furthermore, paragraph 349 of the decision notes ‘if the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act is a valid law, the constitutional foundation for provincial governments is badly damaged and their future as an important level of government is in jeopardy. Federalism, as we have known it for over 150 years, is over.’
“Alberta argued that the Constitution does not permit the federal government to put a provincial minimum price on carbon, and, by imposing a one-size-fits-all carbon tax, Ottawa ignored constitutional provincial authority to legislate in ways that reflect local conditions and circumstances.
“We are defending our province’s interests. Albertans expect us to promote jobs and champion our economy. This is what we are doing by fighting the federal carbon tax, which punishes people for heating their homes and driving to work but does nothing to reduce emissions.
“In March, Alberta will continue to advance its position in the Supreme Court of Canada in the Saskatchewan and Ontario appeals of those provinces’ rulings on this issue.”

Programs and services at the centre will support the wellbeing of seniors and those with complex continuing care needs. The centre will offer highly specialized rehabilitation programs, palliative care, hemodialysis, long-term care, day programs, dementia care and seniors’ mental health services.

“Gene Zwozdesky honoured Albertans by living his life in service to others. His determination to make life better for everyone who calls Alberta home is a powerful legacy. And now, that legacy will live on through the new Gene Zwozdesky Centre at Norwood.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The new facility will play a vital role in increasing continuing care capacity, reducing demand for acute care and assisting post-acute care patients by streamlining access to specialized services at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital and Royal Alexandra Hospital. 

“The CapitalCare Foundation is pleased to see the bringing together of a great continuing care building project for Edmonton with such an amazing Albertan. Gene Zwozdesky’s belief in a ‘community that helps each other’ is the basis of the work we are doing for the Stepping Up for Norwood campaign. We are excited to see the naming of this building to be the Gene Zwozdesky Centre at Norwood.”
Sherry Schaefer, director, CapitalCare Foundation

Construction is underway to expand and re-develop the centre. The project will increase continuing care beds by 145 new spaces in the Edmonton area and help address the growing need for continuing care capacity. The Alberta government is providing $379 million to develop the centre.

“Our family is so proud to have Gene’s name on the new Norwood. He believed in the work CapitalCare has undertaken with this complex initiative, supporting seniors and those requiring assistance to be independent, and he would be truly humbled by this honour.”
Christine Zwozdesky, wife of Gene Zwozdesky

“I hope all Albertans of Tibetan descent enjoy a wonderful new year as they usher in the Year of the Rat.
“Across our province, families will gather to clean and decorate their homes, filling rooms with fragrant incense and sharing traditional foods like khapse. They will exchange gifts, visit friends, dance and pray for good fortune.
“Most of all, they will immerse themselves in their ancient culture and language, as well as in the Buddhist faith that has sustained them for so long.
“As federal immigration minister, I was proud to launch a resettlement program that gave hundreds of Tibetan refugees the chance at a new beginning here in Alberta.
“On behalf of the Government of Alberta, I wish the Tibetan community a bright new year filled with happiness, peace and prosperity. Tashi delek!”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




“Today’s announcement by Teck to withdraw its application for approval of the Frontier project, only days before the federal cabinet was set to decide whether to approve or reject it, is a grave disappointment to Albertans. Alberta has lost the opportunity for 7,000 jobs and Canada has lost the opportunity for $70 billion of dollars in new tax and royalty revenue that could have funded our generous social services over the next four decades. The project would also have produced oil cleaner than half the barrels in North America.
“Teck’s decision is disappointing, but in light of the events of the last few weeks it is not surprising. It is what happens when governments lack the courage to defend the interests of Canadians in the face of a militant minority. The timing of the decision is not a coincidence. This was an economically viable project, as the company confirmed this week, for which the company was advocating earlier this week, so something clearly changed very recently.
“Weeks of federal indecision on the regulatory approval process and inaction in the face of illegal blockades have created more uncertainty for investors looking at Canada. Teck’s predicament shows that even when a company spends more than $1 billion over a decade to satisfy every regulatory requirement, a regulatory process that values politics over evidence and the erosion of the rule of law will be fatal to investor confidence. 
“Today’s announcement must be especially disappointing for all fourteen of the proximate First Nations who have called on the government to approve the Frontier project. In the last 48 hours, the Mikisew Cree First Nation and the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation both signed historic agreements with the Government of Alberta, which would have made them partners in the prosperity of the Frontier project, bringing hundreds of jobs and tens of millions of dollars to their remote communities. 
“The Government of Alberta believes that partnership in resource development is one of the most promising paths to reconciliation, and this week’s agreements with the Mikisew Cree and Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation show how it can be done. Those agreements should have been models for the rest of Canada, but that can only be possible if resource projects are actually approved and built. As long as the federal government undermines confidence in the future of our resource sectors, that path to economic reconciliation will be shut off.      
“The factors that led to today's decision further weaken national unity. The Government of Alberta agreed to every request and condition raised by the federal government for approving the Frontier project, including protecting bison and caribou habitat, regulation of oilsands emissions, and securing full Indigenous support. The Government of Alberta repeatedly asked what more we could do to smooth the approval process. We did our part, but the federal government's inability to convey a clear or unified position let us, and Teck, down. 
“This news deepens our government's resolve to use every tool available to fight for greater control and autonomy for Alberta within Canada, including reinforcing our constitutional right to develop our natural resources, ensuring a sustainable future for our oil and gas industries, and restoring Canada’s reputation as a reliable place to do business.""

“I’m pleased to announce today we have secured agreements with both Mikisew Cree First Nation and Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation supporting the Teck Frontier mine project.  Together these First Nations and Alberta have been able to do what Alberta has always said we can: become true partners in prosperity by developing our resources while protecting the land and culture of our Indigenous people.
“The Teck Frontier mine is a project that has undergone the most thorough regulatory approval process in history, lasting nearly a decade. It will bring wealth, opportunity and thousands of jobs to both the Mikisew Cree and Athabasca Chipewyan First Nations, to other Indigenous communities in the area and to all Albertans. 
“Our First Nations have always had a special relationship with the bison and the protection of their habitat, which demonstrates a respect for their traditional ways of life. To reinforce our commitment to create this wealth responsibly, we have been able to address and sustain bison and caribou habitats, protections for Wood Buffalo National Park, and we have set out a path for cooperative management of the Kitaskino Nuwenëné Wildland and the Ronald Lake Bison Herd.
“Our actions are in addition to the many steps Teck has already taken over 10 years – including efforts to mitigate environmental impact, reduce water use, and committing to progressive reclamation. Teck has also been a partner in addressing the concerns of Indigenous communities, including reducing the footprint of the project and adjusting timelines.
“I want to personally thank Chief Waquan and Chief Adam who have demonstrated strong leadership for their people, working hard to balance differing interests and determining the best path for their communities. Their vision of how resource development can happen alongside Indigenous culture is of great value.
“I am proud of what our partners, including Teck, Mikisew Cree and Athabasca Chipewyan, have achieved with this agreement. It is more important than ever to demonstrate that real and meaningful reconciliation can be advanced by ensuring our First Nations are real partners in prosperity. That’s why I am again calling on the federal government to approve the Teck Frontier mine project, given that the major concerns raised by the Joint Review Panel have been addressed. The opportunity that this project presents for our Indigenous communities, our province and the thousands of jobs it would create cannot be killed for political reasons. This project has played by the rules. It has followed the process. It’s time to get it done.”

At approximately 11:20 a.m., police dispatched two officers to the site of a reported vehicle theft, in the area of 119 Street and 132 Avenue. While police were interviewing the complainant at a nearby location, a 28-year-old man returned to the area with the allegedly stolen vehicle. The man exited the vehicle and fled while the officers pursued him on foot.
A short time later, the man was located seated inside a parked black Jeep, which had also been reported stolen. A confrontation occurred between the officers and the man, at which time the vehicle was put into motion. During these events, one of the officers discharged their service pistol.  The man then exited the vehicle and was arrested by police and taken into custody. There were no injuries to civilians or police.
ASIRT’s investigation will focus on the actions of police during this incident, while Edmonton Police Service will maintain responsibility for the investigation into the initial complaint and the man’s subsequent actions. ASIRT investigators are asking anyone who witnessed this incident or may have photos or video to call ASIRT at 780-644-1483.
As ASIRT’s investigation is underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person. For the purposes of this mandate, this includes officer-involved shootings that would likely have resulted in serious injury or death if anyone was struck.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

Premier Jason Kenney announces a major upgrade and modernization for the Glenbow Museum. Pictured (L-R): Infrastructure Minister Prasad Panda, Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women Minister Leela Sharon Aheer, Premier Jason Kenney, MLA for Calgary-South East Matt Jones, president & CEO of Glenbow Museum Nicholas Bell

The Glenbow has been downtown Calgary’s premier art and history museum for more than 50 years. Provincial funding will make possible the Glenbow’s revitalization project, transforming and modernizing the building for current and future generations of Albertans.

“Ours is a proud history that should be preserved and celebrated. For half a century, the Glenbow has been at the forefront of these efforts, showcasing our rich history for visitors from here at home and around the world.
“The Glenbow is a jewel in Alberta’s cultural crown, but for some time this 45-year-old building has been falling into disrepair. This revitalization project is necessary to preserve the Glenbow, and give it new life as a world-class art gallery.
“This investment will finally allow the Glenbow’s enormously valuable, provincially owned collection to be put on public display, allowing Calgary to join every other major Canadian city in having a first-rate public art gallery. The revitalization of the Glenbow will play a role in our government’s renewed tourism strategy and will enhance Calgary’s quality of life.

“Finally, this investment by taxpayers is part of our government’s commitment to grow the economy and create jobs by maintaining record investments in infrastructure, even during a time of fiscal restraint.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Our government is committed to investing in cultural infrastructure that enriches the lives of Albertans. The new vision of the Glenbow will create a space that honours our rich heritage and inspires future generations of artists. This project will ensure that we are protecting our heritage and the artistic works that Albertans call their own. Our investment ensures that we are connecting Albertans to their heritage and with this funding we are keeping our history alive and accessible for Albertans to enjoy now and in the future.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women


“This investment in the Glenbow demonstrates our government’s commitment to preserving Alberta’s heritage. The project will create approximately 650 jobs and result in modernizing infrastructure that helps attract industry to Alberta.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure

Project plans include new meeting spaces available for rent, a restaurant, enhanced retail experiences and a flexible-use theatre. These additions will provide additional revenue opportunities for the Glenbow and ensure its long-term sustainability.

“Glenbow has called downtown Calgary home for more than 40 years. We are ecstatic that this support from the people of Alberta and Canada gives us an opportunity to reimagine our place in the heart of Calgary’s cultural district. We have ambitious plans to revitalize Glenbow to better serve the diverse needs of all Albertans.”
Nicholas R. Bell, president and CEO, Glenbow

Le musée Glenbow, qui s’est donné pour mandat de devenir un musée d'art public de renommée mondiale, se rapproche de son but, grâce à l'attribution provisoire d'un financement provincial pouvant atteindre 40 millions de dollars, qui lui permettra de réaliser un projet de modernisation de ses infrastructures.
Le musée Glenbow est le musée d'art et d'histoire par excellence du centre-ville de Calgary depuis plus de 50 ans. Le financement provincial rendra possible le projet de modernisation du musée, projet qui permettra de transformer le bâtiment et de le moderniser au bénéfice des générations actuelles et futures d'Albertains et d’Albertaines.

« Notre histoire fascinante mérite d’être préservée et célébrée. Depuis un demi-siècle, au cœur de ces efforts de préservation, le musée Glenbow met en valeur notre riche histoire au profit des visiteurs d'ici et du monde entier.
« Joyau culturel de l'Alberta, le bâtiment de 45 ans s’est toutefois grandement détérioré au fil du temps. Le projet de modernisation est donc nécessaire pour assurer la préservation du musée et lui donner le nouveau statut de galerie d'art de classe mondiale.
« Cet investissement permettra enfin d'exposer au public l’immense et précieuse collection du musée qui appartient à la province. Calgary pourra ainsi se joindre aux grandes villes canadiennes qui disposent d'une galerie d'art publique de premier ordre. Par ailleurs, la modernisation du musée Glenbow contribuera à renouveler la stratégie touristique de notre gouvernement, tout en améliorant la qualité de vie des résidents et résidentes de Calgary.
« En outre, cet investissement des contribuables s'inscrit dans le cadre de l'engagement de notre gouvernement à faire croitre l'économie et à créer des emplois en maintenant des investissements records dans les infrastructures, même en période de restrictions budgétaires. »
Jason Kenney, premier ministre


« Notre gouvernement s'est engagé à investir dans les infrastructures culturelles qui enrichissent la vie des Albertains et des Albertaines. Le nouveau musée créera un espace qui célèbrera notre riche patrimoine et qui inspirera les générations d'artistes à venir s’installer. Ce projet nous permettra de protéger notre patrimoine et les œuvres d’art qui représentent justement la population albertaine. Notre investissement nous aide à créer des liens entre les Albertains et leur patrimoine et, grâce à ce financement, nous faisons vivre notre histoire et la rendons accessible aux Albertains et aux Albertaines, pour qu’ils puissent en profiter maintenant et dans l'avenir. »
Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine


« Cet investissement dans le musée Glenbow démontre l'engagement de notre gouvernement à préserver le patrimoine de l'Alberta. Le projet créera environ 650 emplois et il permettra de moderniser les infrastructures qui contribuent à attirer l’industrie en Alberta. »
Prasad Panda, ministre de l'Infrastructure

Le projet prévoit la construction de nouvelles salles de réunion à louer, en plus d’un restaurant, de locaux commerciaux améliorés et d’une salle de théâtre à vocations multiples. Ces ajouts fourniront des possibilités de revenus supplémentaires pour le musée et ils assureront sa viabilité à long terme.

« Le musée Glenbow a servi des millions d'Albertains et d’Albertaines depuis sa fondation il y a plus de cinquante ans. Nous sommes ravis que ce généreux soutien de la population de l'Alberta nous donne l'occasion de réenvisager la place du musée au cœur du district culturel de Calgary, et la façon dont nous répondons aux besoins diversifiés de notre communauté. La modernisation de notre bâtiment favorisera la viabilité du musée dans l'avenir, en plus d’assurer un accès accru à l'une des plus belles collections et à l'un des meilleurs programmes muséaux du Canada. »
Irfhan Rawji, président du Conseil d’administration du musée Glenbow

En bref

Le musée Glenbow fait partie des grandes institutions culturelles de l'Alberta. Dans le passé, ses installations ont abrité un musée, une galerie d'art, une bibliothèque et un centre d’archives.
Au cours des dernières années, la direction du musée a voulu recadrer le mandat de l'institution pour lui donner principalement le rôle de musée d'art.
Le bâtiment du musée Glenbow, de même que la grande majorité de ses collections, appartiennent au gouvernement de l'Alberta.

“Human trafficking is a dehumanizing and predatory crime that violates a person’s most basic human rights and dignity.
“Human traffickers prey upon people of all ages, ethnicities and genders. Traffickers coerce their victims into providing labour or sexual services against their will, and use threats and violence to trap them in a cycle of exploitation.
“Standing up for the vulnerable is a core responsibility of our government and we will not sit idly by and allow this abuse to go unchecked in Alberta. We are committed to protecting trafficking survivors, some of the most vulnerable people in Alberta. We have a nine-point Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking to take on traffickers and others who treat people as commodities.
“We must also all work together to increase awareness that human trafficking is a reality in our province. We must speak up and help those who need support.
“By recognizing National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, we bring to light a crime that too often goes unreported or unintentionally ignored, and take a stand to protect survivors of human trafficking.
“We support these survivors. In the upcoming legislative session, we intend to deliver on a key platform commitment to enact legislation that will empower survivors of trafficking, help protect them, and provide new remedies they can take against their traffickers.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Existing terms will remain in place until March 31, 2020. A new funding framework will then be introduced, in a multi-year process that will require consultation with the AMA at all stages. The new framework will make changes proposed during negotiations to prevent cost overruns, align benefit programs and administrative fees with those of comparable provinces, and improve services for patients.
The eleven consultation proposals will also be implemented on March 31. This includes phasing in changes to complex modifiers, reducing the rate physicians can charge for this billing code to $9 from $18, for a period of one year before the code is removed in 2021-22. In summer 2020, at the direction of the Minister of Health, the Government of Alberta will also introduce a new alternative relationship plan (ARP) with built-in transition benefits to encourage physicians to move from fee-for-service to a three-year contract.

“Our province is facing cost overruns of $2 billion in the next three years due solely to physician compensation. If left unaddressed, these costs would impede efforts to reduce surgical wait times, improve mental health and addiction services, and expand the number of continuing care beds. Despite repeated efforts, the AMA failed to put forward alternatives that would hold the line on physician compensation. The new framework announced today will prevent cost overruns, allow our province to improve services for patients, and still ensure that Alberta’s doctors are amongst the highest paid physicians in all of Canada.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Background

The new funding framework will maintain government’s current level of spending on physicians at $5.4 billion.
The new funding framework avoids anticipated cost overruns of $2 billion over the next three years.
Alberta has been spending more on physician salaries than other provinces, yet most of its health outcomes are below national averages.
A doctor in Alberta earns approximately $90,000 more than a doctor in Ontario and physicians’ fees have almost tripled since 2002.

Elements of the new funding framework

Changes to Alberta’s complex modifier billing system. The rate physicians are able to charge for complex modifiers will be reduced to $9 from $18 for a period of one year before this billing code is removed in 2021-22. Once the new framework is fully phased in, physicians will be able to bill an additional fee after spending 25 minutes with a complex patient case. Alberta remains the only province in Canada that allows for a top-up payment for complex visits.
Removal of the comprehensive annual care plan from the list of insured services. Currently, physicians can also bill for a similar consultation called a comprehensive annual visit. No other province in Canada compensates physicians twice for annual care consultation.
Implementation of a new daily cap, modelled after a cap in place in British Columbia, of 65 patients per day. Large patient loads can contribute to physician burnout and may compromise patient safety and quality of care.
Removing physician overhead subsidies from all hospital-based services. Physicians who work in AHS facilities should not be billing for overhead costs that their community physician colleagues face, such as leases, hiring staff and purchasing equipment.
Ending of clinical payments, or stipends, by AHS to physicians. This change ends duplication of payments to contracted physicians.

Timeline

In September 2019, government provided notice to the AMA that it intended to begin negotiations on the AMA Agreement. The notification provided time for the AMA to prepare its proposals.
In November 2019, negotiations began with the AMA to reach a new agreement; government began consultations on 11 proposed changes to the schedule of medical benefits (SOMB, or “insured services”).
In January 2020, negotiations and consultations proceeded with no agreement reached. Mediation, on both the negotiation and consultation proposals, began January 31 and continued into February.
The parties were not able to reach an agreement during mediation.
Government will implement its final offer from the negotiating table, including the 11 consultation proposals, on March 31.

The newly appointed members offer strong and diverse skill sets honed largely within the energy sector that will complement and expand the board’s knowledge and experience.

“As the agency responsible for the day-to-day operation of the province’s electricity grid, the AESO’s work is vital to all Albertans. The complex nature of this work requires proven leadership and expertise, and I’m confident these appointees will contribute greatly to the AESO’s ongoing success.”  
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy

The following members have been appointed for three-year terms:

Ann-Marie Osinski, a senior financial executive with extensive strategic planning, risk and financial management and business development experience in the global energy, transportation, distribution and logistics industries.
Aaron Engen, a managing director and co-head of the Power & Energy Infrastructure Group at BMO Capital Markets; also a lawyer, he practiced corporate and securities law, mainly in the power and utilities sector.
Karl Johannson, a former executive vice-president and president of natural gas at TransCanada Pipelines, brings strong financial, operations and investment experience to the board.

Quick facts

The AESO is the corporation established as the Independent System Operator under the Electric Utilities Act.
Under the act, the minister has the authority to appoint up to nine AESO members and designate one of the members as chair.
These appointments fill vacant positions.
Each member is eligible to receive a $27,500 annual retainer and $1,000 for each AESO board and committee meeting they attend.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Effective April 1, Albertans travelling in another country will no longer be covered for elective, non-urgent health services and routine lab tests.
Making this change brings Alberta in line with most other Canadian provinces. Only Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador provide out-of-country coverage for elective, non-urgent health services.
There will be no change to coverage for emergency health services. Unlike the recent change in Ontario, Albertans will continue to be partially reimbursed for insured emergency health services needed when travelling outside Canada.
For years, Albertans have been strongly encouraged to obtain travel medical insurance when travelling outside the province to assist with health-care costs. Current coverage is quite limited and covers only a small portion of the high cost of medical care outside of Canada.
This change is expected to save Alberta about $1 million annually. The savings will be reinvested into strengthening the province’s health system.
Alberta’s independent Out-of-Country Health Services Committee will continue accepting applications for funding of insured, medically necessary services that aren’t available in Canada.

This capital funding is in addition to the $20.6 billion annual budget for health services, the highest ever in the province and the highest per capita of all provinces.

“For years, Calgarians have been calling for the Peter Lougheed Centre to be expanded, and our government is delivering. We are committed to making long-term capital investments in the facilities that Albertans need to stay healthy, strengthening public health care and improving access to the services that matter most.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

The Lougheed Centre has one of the busiest and most congested emergency departments in the province.
These renovations will improve access to emergency care and boost mental health services by adding a new mental health intensive care unit and expanding the mental health short-stay unit.
The project will provide faster care and more privacy and comfort for patients and families, in a space that will serve Calgary and Southern Alberta families for decades to come.

“Staff at Peter Lougheed hospital have been going full blast for many years, providing top-quality emergency care to twice as many patients as the space was designed to serve. This project will give families in and around Calgary better access to life-saving emergency and mental health services.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“This investment of $137 million into the Peter Lougheed Centre will benefit all Calgarians. We remain committed to addressing the vital infrastructure needs of Albertans, and we will continue to make significant investments in our health system.”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure

A new rapid-response laboratory will also be built to replace the current aging lab, and provide state-of-the-art diagnostic services.

“This announcement is great news for Calgarians. This expansion will greatly benefit both patients and staff today and in the future, by ensuring our health-care infrastructure and services keep up with the growing needs of people in Calgary.”
Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO, Alberta Health Services

Budget 2020 commits $137 million in capital funding for the Peter Lougheed project over three years. Additional capital dollars for other health projects will be announced in Budget 2020, to be released on February 27.
Design work will begin soon, with construction of the first phase of the project scheduled to start in 2022. This will include expansion of the emergency department by 1,500 square metres, including new triage and trauma areas, and moving the ambulance drop-off closer to the emergency department.
Quick facts

The Peter Lougheed Centre opened in 1988 with an emergency department designed to accommodate 30,000 to 40,000 patient visits, and a maximum design capacity of 59,500 visits.
In 2018/19, the hospital handled almost 82,000 emergency visits.
Mental health visits to the emergency department have increased by more than one-third in the past five years.
The mental health short-stay unit at the hospital is consistently at more than 100 per cent capacity.
Lab volumes at the hospital are also growing, with 2.3 million tests forecast to be done at the site by 2029/30, up by more than one-third from current levels.

A government review launched in fall 2019, seeks to address pressing issues such as escalating costs and to develop solutions that will ensure affordable, accessible and sustainable auto insurance options for the long term. A three-member advisory committee is leading the review.
As part of the review, the committee is conducting a survey, and seeking input from Albertans, service providers and other stakeholders through online or written submissions. 

“As we review Alberta’s automobile insurance system, we are asking Albertans, service providers and other relevant stakeholders to be part of the potential solution. A thorough understanding of consumer and industry needs will help ensure our recommendations to the government are realistic and reflective of the marketplace as a whole.”
Chris Daniel, chair, Automobile Insurance Advisory Committee

Advisory committee mandate
The committee is tasked with exploring options to reform Alberta’s automobile insurance system and making recommendations to government. The committee’s work is guided by the following principles:

Fair, accessible and affordable automobile insurance for Albertans.
Timely and appropriate outcomes when claims are made.
A private-sector delivery model for automobile insurance.
A viable and sustainable automobile insurance system.

Quick facts

The overall engagement process, including the public survey, was developed by the advisory committee.
The survey will be open until March 6 at alberta.ca.
The committee will deliver its recommendations to government in June 2020.
Industry data shows Albertans pay the third-highest rates for auto insurance in Canada, behind B.C. and Ontario.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The Government of Alberta is reviewing regulations for the commercial transportation industry to reduce red tape and remove redundant regulations on job creators.
Albertans can have their say on commercial transportation rules, and how they can be improved, through an online survey from February 18 to March 18.
As part of its review, government will also work directly with commercial trucking, bus and service companies to ensure the rules focus on safety while reducing red tape. The review will cover use of electronic logging devices, hours of service rules and Alberta’s implementation of National Safety Code Standards. The review is not looking at changes to requirements for mandatory entry level training for Class 1 and 2 drivers.

“Our government is working to reduce costs on job creators and encourage new and existing businesses to get Albertans back to work. We want to make sure that the rules in place actually keep the roads safe and do not just put up more barriers to creating jobs. Working directly with trucking, bus, and service companies to review our road rules and regulations will let us hear directly from Albertans and businesses about how we can reduce costs and create jobs.”
Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation


“Hearing from the people who work right in the trenches is an important step to identifying where our government can cut time and money saving red tape. I commend Minister McIver for taking this thoughtful approach to removing redundant regulations for trucking, bus and service companies that will ultimately create jobs and get more Albertans back to work.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction

Updating Alberta’s commercial transportation regulations is part of the government’s commitment to reduce red tape.
Quick facts

The regulation of commercial carriers is a shared responsibility between the federal, provincial and territorial governments. The purpose of this oversight is to ensure that commercial drivers and vehicles are safe to operate on the road.
The Government of Alberta oversees more than 25,000 commercial carriers in the province.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The new model streamlines operations and directs more dollars to each school division. In the 2020-21 school year, every single division will see an increase in operational funding.
The model also provides more predictability in funding by changing from one-year enrolment counts to a moving three-year average, minimizing the need for mid-year adjustments to school budgets. The move will help school divisions plan their finances well in advance of the start of the school year.

“Alberta will continue to have one of the best-funded education systems in the country. This new model will drive more money to our school divisions for use in the classroom and provides them with the flexibility they need to meet the unique needs of their students. These changes will ensure our divisions continue to be equipped to provide our students with a world-class, high quality education.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

The new model also reduces red tape and gives more flexibility to school divisions to determine how to best invest taxpayer dollars. By simplifying the number of grants to 15 from the current 36, while still maintaining education funding, school divisions will have reduced reporting obligations and more leeway to direct funding to support the needs of students.

“This government is committed to cutting unnecessary red tape by one-third to reduce costs, speed up approvals and make life better for Albertans. I am thrilled that we are updating and streamlining the K-12 funding model, while maintaining robust measures to ensure money is being directed to the classroom. School boards can now spend less time on unnecessary reporting and administration work and more time focusing on students.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction

Highlights of the new model include:

Ensuring funds are directed to classrooms by providing a targeted grant for system administration, instead of a percentage of overall funding. This will standardize administrative and governance spending to within a reasonable range and maximize dollars intended for classrooms. The new model will also simplify grants to reduce red-tape for school authorities.
Protecting our most vulnerable students by providing funding intended to support specialized learning needs or groups of students who may require additional supports from school authorities, including Program Unit Funding, funding for English as a Second Language students, French as a Second Language students, refugee students and First Nations, Métis and Inuit students.
Better managing system growth, specifically enrolment growth and associated costs. Instead of funding based on a student count each year calculated in the fall, the new model will adopt a weighted, moving three-year average when calculating enrolment for funding. Using a weighted moving average means school boards will no longer have to wait until they have a confirmed number of students — typically at the end of September when the school year is already underway — to determine how much funding they will have for the year. This should minimize school authorities having to adjust their revenue forecasts and/or staffing levels throughout the school year.
Providing funding predictability for school authorities by confirming their funding commitments from the province by the end of March each year, instead of the end of September when the school year has already begun. This will minimize the need for mid-year adjustments to budgets and staffing, create better alignment between the school year and the government’s fiscal year, and provide boards with more predictability in their planning and budgeting processes. A move to a block-funding model for small rural schools will also ensure the long-term viability of these schools where per-student funding does not provide adequate resources to properly deliver programs and services.
Enhancing system accountability for school jurisdictions. The new model will include new accountability measures keeping school boards accountable for student outcomes, community engagement and continuous improvement.


“Our new funding model gives schools more of what they want – flexibility, stability and predictability. Flexibility to invest provincial dollars in areas that make the most sense for their communities. Stability in the number of grants and what the province expects for reporting. And predictability in their funding envelope to allow for better planning well ahead of each school year.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

The funding model for K-12 education has not changed in more than 15 years. The province met with each public, separate and Francophone school division, along with other system partners, in the fall of 2019 to discuss improvements to the way funding flows to school divisions. Overall, divisions wanted more predictability in their funding so they could better plan for each school year, more flexibility in how they spend provincial dollars based on their own needs in their communities, and reductions in provincial red tape.
Specific details for each grant and each school division’s funding will be available in Budget 2020, and will take effect for the 2020-21 school year.

“The College of Alberta School Superintendents recognizes the significant efforts Minister LaGrange has taken to engage with individual school authorities, the CASS Board and other education partners in the development of this new funding framework. The Minister’s willingness to listen and incorporate this feedback is clear as the new funding framework reflects a return to increased autonomy for local board decision making coupled with a reduction in the red tape school authorities have been challenged with in recent years. Finally, while we certainly recognize the fiscal challenges our province is currently experiencing, we are gratified to hear the Minister’s commitment in this budget to an increase in overall projected budget for every Alberta school authority over the previous year’s funding.”
Bevan Daverne, president, College of Alberta School Superintendents


“We appreciate that the government considered input from the education system as they developed the new funding model. This new model will reduce some of the red tape associated with accessing certain grants. It will also give school boards the ability to better predict the amount of funding they will receive in future years within the new, simplified model.”

Rod Steeves, president, Association of School Business Officials of Alberta



“Alberta School Boards Association (ASBA) is pleased that government consulted with us on the new assurance and funding framework. We appreciate that government has released the funding framework, as ASBA requested, in advance of the budget. This allows boards time to review and understand the implications within the context of their local realities. ASBA will work closely with school boards and government to support implementation upon release of the budget.”
Lorrie Jess, president, Alberta School Boards Association


“We appreciate that Minister LaGrange has listened to our concerns and demonstrated her confidence and trust in the local autonomy of school boards to make decisions that are in the best interests of their students. While this is a complex matter that will take time for us to determine the impact on the classroom, we are optimistic that these changes will bring opportunity for our district. The reduction of red tape afforded by the new model will help reduce the complexity and workload involved in providing extensive and repetitious data, which in turn, will allow our teachers to focus on what is most important — our students.”
Mary Martin, board chair, Calgary Catholic School District


“Allowing important education funding decisions at a local level is a great step forward for parents’ choice in education and the ability of local school divisions — working with parents — to ensure key priorities are met. This new funding model will provide flexibility on how school divisions provide a precise and quality education to meet the needs of the students and the communities they serve.”
Clark McAskile, board chair, Fort Vermilion School Division


“We are pleased to see that Minister LaGrange has been responsive to our concerns for less red tape as well as targeted supports for small rural schools. We are also pleased to see her continued support for local board autonomy and the flexibility for our board to manage those decisions that most impact our students. We look forward to the release of the full budget details and are hopeful, even in difficult economic times, this new framework will continue to support our board as we provide high quality public education to our students.“
Laurie Huntley, board chair, Golden Hills School Division


“We are pleased to see the government trust locally elected boards to make the right decisions for their students by providing us flexibility within our funding envelopes. The increased flexibility afforded by this new funding model will help us better allocate resources to address the unique needs of our students, while also cutting down on the significant red tape that was tied to the previous funding structure. We are looking forward to working with the government as this model rolls out for the 2020-21 school year.”
John Lehners, board chair, Grande Prairie Public School Division

“The Government of Alberta is spending more than ever before on our public health care system and we will maintain current spending.
“In order to ensure that our public health care system remains sustainable, we must act to maintain physician spending at current levels.
“Unfortunately, efforts to achieve this goal were unsuccessful during voluntary mediation with the Alberta Medical Association. Our government will take this time to carefully consider all options at our disposal.
“Cost overruns are forecast to amount to $2 billion over the next three years – this is unacceptable. Any savings that will be achieved through our efforts to curtail costs of physician compensation will be reinvested into front-line services such as reducing surgical wait times, addressing mental health and addictions issues, and investing in continuing care.
“Our government believes we can address these priorities, while also keeping our hardworking and dedicated physicians amongst the highest paid in Canada.”

Minister of Infrastructure Prasad Panda joins Patrick Dumelie, CEO of Covenant Health to swing ceremonial hammers launching demolition at the Misericordia Hospital making way for a new Emergency Department.

The demolition and remediation phase of the project should take four months to complete with the Misericordia re-development project creating approximately 445 jobs during the construction phase.

“Hundreds of skilled tradespeople and professionals in Alberta will be key to building a top-quality emergency department. Following the demolition phase, we’ll bring in the big equipment and construction activities will start this summer running through to late 2022. We know that building the vital public infrastructure, on which Albertans rely, is key to attracting investment and ensuring our province remains on the road to economic recovery”
Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure


“This is an exciting next step towards a bigger, better and more modern hospital emergency department for west Edmonton. I know it’s been a long wait for residents and staff, but our government is committed to this vital project at the Misericordia Hospital that will provide a better environment to serve more patients and families.”

Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


When completed the emergency department expansion will include space for six ambulance bays, emergency waiting and treatment areas and diagnostic services.

“With the increased emergency department capacity, Covenant Health and the Misericordia will be better equipped to provide high- quality, compassionate care to our patients and to serve as an important partner in Alberta’s health care system. The new ED is critical to meeting the health care needs of our communities.”
Patrick Dumelie, Chief Executive Officer, Covenant Health

The chapel, west annex and the Family Medicine Centre (the centre was relocated to the Cabrini Centre) will be taken down to make room for the emergency room expansion.
All phases of construction are closely co-ordinated with hospital staff to ensure public safety and to minimize impact on patients, staff and visitors. 
The new emergency department will accommodate 60,000 patient visits per year.
The existing emergency department will stay open until the expanded emergency department is operational.

Premier Jason Kenney, Robert Weismental, Minister Rajan Sawhney, Bruce Reith, executive director for Hope Mission and Terry Duguid, parliamentary secretary for Western Economic Diversification Canada announce funding to rebuild Hope Mission’s Herb Jamieson Centre.

The new emergency shelter will be more accessible to those with special needs, have improved safety measures and offer better support for people affected by homelessness. The centre will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and have space for 400 people.
Premier Jason Kenney and Terry Duguid, parliamentary secretary for Western Economic Diversification Canada, made the funding announcement.

“For decades the Hope Mission has been a reprieve for the homeless, the poor, and the marginalized. Motivated by a faith that teaches people to ‘love your neighbour,’ Hope Mission has offered a warm bed, a hot meal, and a loving welcome to tens of thousands at a time of need. The mission now desperately needs to replace its aging emergency shelter, which is why our government ran on a platform commitment to partner with private donors to get the job done. I’m excited to announce our contribution to this important project that will help those most in need of shelter.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Our government is dedicated to helping those in need, which is why we are proud to invest in the redevelopment of the Herb Jamieson Centre. With capacity to help up to 400 people, the shelter will soon continue to play a vital role in breaking the cycle of homelessness in Edmonton. I congratulate Hope Mission for the crucial role they play in the community.”
Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation


“The Herb Jamieson Centre will provide much-needed updated shelter capacity in Edmonton. We are committed to providing supports to these very vulnerable people to ensure that emergent needs are met and long term healing is provided. We support the Herb Jamieson Centre’s mission to help people out of homelessness and into community.” 
Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services


“Our government is working to strengthen our housing system so it can support Albertans who need it most – now and in the years to come. Investments in projects like Hope Mission’s Herb Jamieson Centre, in partnership with the federal government, will ensure the emergency shelter will be more modern and will have the capacity to provide physical and mental health supports for people in need.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“The new Herb Jamieson Centre will be a vital resource for everyone who comes through our doors in search of shelter. I am thankful to the Alberta government and to all of our donors for their support. Because of you, this vision will become reality.”
Bruce Reith, executive director, Hope Mission

The current site of the Herb Jamieson Centre is now closed. Hope Mission has received a demolition and building permit and construction is expected to start in spring 2020. 
Quick facts

The total estimated cost to rebuild the Herb Jamieson Centre is $16 million.
A total of $8 million is cost-shared between the federal and provincial governments to enable the new shelter build.
Hope Mission has received $6.1 million in contributions towards this new shelter build.
At its close, the Herb Jamieson Centre operated out of an Alberta Infrastructure-owned building constructed in 1954 and an adjacent trailer. The shelter capacity was 285.
In 2019-20, Community and Social Services provided Hope Mission with $5.5 million to operate 525 spaces in the main Hope Mission emergency homeless shelter and the Herb Jamieson Centre.
During the Herb Jamieson Centre rebuild, Hope Mission has increased capacity in its main facility to accommodate 540 people.
Hope Mission is working with the City of Edmonton to obtain permits to use a local church gymnasium as emergency overflow space, if needed.
The Government of Canada is currently rolling out its National Housing Strategy (NHS), an ambitious 10-year, $55 billion plan that will create 125,000 new housing units and lift 530,000 families out of housing need, as well as repair and renew more than 300,000 housing units, to reduce chronic homelessness by 50 per cent.
The NHS is built on strong partnerships between federal, provincial and territorial governments, and on continuous engagement with others, including municipalities, Indigenous governments and organizations, and the social and private sectors, to make a meaningful difference in the lives of Canadians.

The Alberta Anti-Racism Advisory Council meet with Premier Jason Kenney and Minister Leela Sharon Aheer in Edmonton.

The council is composed of 24 community leaders from across the province, representing a variety of faiths and cultures. The council’s mandate focuses on anti-racism and on the broader priorities of multiculturalism and inclusion.

“Albertans are welcoming and generous people who embrace diversity. Alberta is a great success in achieving unity in our diversity, but we can’t take that success for granted. We need to continue combatting racism and other forms of hatred. I’m looking forward to getting practical input from the Anti-Racism Advisory Council on how to do so.”
Jason Kenney, Premier 

Premier Kenney, Minister Aheer and council members discussed strategies to inspire Albertans to see the value of diversity. The council seeks to ensure that all Albertans fully participate in the economic and social fabric of their communities and are valued for their contributions.

“The advice of the Anti-Racism Advisory Council will influence our approach in creating a cohesive and inclusive Alberta that celebrates its diversity. I am grateful we can rely on the experience and expertise of the council members to shape an Alberta that is free from racism and discrimination and where all Albertans feel secure, valued and engaged.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women


“It is heartening that the Alberta government continues to uphold their commitment to take action against racism. Articulating tangible actions towards anti-racism is fundamental to Alberta’s economic growth, prosperity, and future. I remain honoured to share the leadership of the council and their work that ensures all Albertans have the opportunity to thrive.”
Heather Campbell, co-chair, Anti-Racism Advisory Council


“Tackling racism is a long-term process. Albertans have told us that they want to see better ways of recognizing foreign credentials, teaching respect and acceptance in our classrooms, preventing hate crimes and reflecting diversity in government. We are pleased to meet again as a council to work together on these priority actions to achieve racial equity and inclusion.”
Lucenia Ortiz, co-chair, Anti-Racism Advisory Council

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Albertans are encouraged to consider nominating someone who has demonstrated extraordinary dedication and commitment to their trade and to apprenticeship and industry training.

“We need to send the message that trades make a huge contribution to our prosperity. Our province has literally been built by brilliant tradespeople and it is past time that we begin to honour their commitment to excellence. It’s also critical that we send a message to young Albertans that a trade certificate has every bit as much value as a university degree.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“The skilled trades are a foundational part of Alberta’s economy. I am pleased to open nominations for the first-ever Alberta Trades Hall of Fame. These awards will help celebrate the skilled trades professions and honour Albertans who work everyday to support the growth and success of skilled trades and apprenticeship across the province.”
Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education

The Alberta Trades Hall of Fame is part of the government’s Skills for Jobs agenda, which includes a commitment of more than $20 million to support and expand skilled jobs and apprenticeship education. Nominations can come from any Albertan: someone in industry, education, an apprentice or someone who simply knows a person who should be recognized for their contributions to the skilled trades and apprenticeship education.

“Nominees to the Alberta Trades Hall of Fame will be those extraordinary Albertans who have made a difference in their fields, who have worked hard to build our province and provide leadership in the development of our highly skilled workforce. They will be the people who have provided the education and mentorship that continues to raise the quality of our province’s skilled trades and certified professionals.”
Jackie Armstrong-Homeniuk, chair, Alberta Skilled Trades Caucus and MLA for Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville


“Albertans have always valued the exceptional quality of work of our highly skilled tradespeople and certified professionals. I am excited to see who will be nominated for the new Alberta Trades Hall of Fame because they will be individuals who have worked hard through any number of paths, and earned the respect that comes with helping people build careers and lives, which ultimately helps to build our province and our future.”
j’Amey Bevan, chair, Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training Board

“Our government made a strong commitment to improve our justice system for law-abiding Albertans. We previously announced that we would double the number of articling students at the Department of Justice and Solicitor General from eight to 16, and I am pleased to announce that these spots have been filled.    
“The students will start on July 2, and to fulfil our government’s promise to ensure rural Albertans are better served by the justice system, they will be placed in a variety of locations including Fort McMurray, Grande Prairie, Slave Lake, Fort Saskatchewan, Wetaskiwin, the Edmonton Rural and Regional Response Office and Calgary Rural and Regional Response Office.
“Articling students will receive valuable and practical experience and will help Crown prosecutors focus on higher priority files, making our justice system faster and more efficient. 
“Our government pledged to ensure our justice system has the tools and resources it needs. Hiring these articling students is just one step we are taking. We look forward to welcoming even more students in 2021 – when the number of articling students will increase to at least 20 – ensuring that the Government of Alberta is the highest employer of articling students to ensure skilled Albertans have the opportunities to live, work and raise families here.
“Promise made. Promise kept.”

On that day at approximately 5 p.m., RCMP members conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle in the parking lot of the Home Hardware store in Blairmore. The vehicle was believed to be associated with an ongoing investigation in the Crowsnest Pass area. During the interaction that followed, a confrontation occurred between two members of the RCMP and the lone occupant of the truck. During that confrontation, both RCMP members discharged their service pistols.
Following the confrontation, the vehicle left the parking lot and travelled a short distance before coming to rest off the highway. When the vehicle came to rest, RCMP members determined that the occupant of the vehicle had sustained gunshot wounds. They provided first aid until the arrival of EMS, who pronounced the man dead on scene.
ASIRT’s investigation will focus on the actions of police during this incident, while the RCMP will maintain responsibility for the investigation that led to the traffic stop. ASIRT investigators are asking anyone who witnessed this incident or may have photos or video to call ASIRT at 403-592-4306.
As ASIRT’s investigation is underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

In addition to homes and businesses, the Cougar Creek debris flood retention structure will protect critical infrastructure, including Highways 1 and 1A, the Canadian Pacific Railway main line, a school and the RCMP detachment. Electric transmission lines and a high-pressure natural gas pipeline will also be protected.

“People in Canmore understand the devastation caused by severe flooding, including damage done by mountain debris. The Cougar Creek Dam will help mitigate the public safety risks posed by debris floods by providing a reliable level of protection for homes, businesses and critical infrastructure in Canmore.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks


“The Town of Canmore is excited to receive the final approval for the construction of the debris retention structure on Cougar Creek. This structure is key to our long-term mitigation, and will protect thousands of Canmore residents during a flood event while safeguarding critical infrastructure vital to our community. We have been developing this major project in partnership with the province, and thank both the federal and provincial governments for committing 90 per cent of the funding for this important project.”
John Borrowman, mayor, Town of Canmore

The $48.8-million project is funded by all three levels of government, including $30.3 million from the province. Provincial funding has been fully allocated for this project and the Town of Canmore is responsible for ongoing maintenance and operating costs, so there are no implications for Budget 2020.  

“This is an important project for the residents of Canmore, who can now be assured that they – and their community, family, friends, and wildlife neighbours– are protected from future flooding. I’m glad to see this project not only approved, but fully funded. This is a great step towards a future of continued growth and confidence for Canmore's residents and business community.”
Miranda Roisin, MLA for Banff-Kananaskis

The Natural Resources Conservation Board (NRCB) originally released its decision affirming that the project is in the public interest in November 2018. A modified submission by the Town of Canmore was accepted by the NRCB in October 2019.
The NRCB approval includes conditions to ensure environmental impacts are minimized, commitments made to Treaty 7 First Nations are honoured, and plans for health and safety and emergency management are completed to the satisfaction of Environment and Parks. 
Quick facts

The debris flood retention structure will be located on Cougar Creek, approximately two kilometres northeast of the Trans-Canada Highway.
The dam will be nearly 33 metres high and capable of holding back up to 760,000 cubic metres of water and mountain debris.
During a flood event, water and mountain debris will be temporarily held behind the dam, with water released back down Cougar Creek in a controlled manner.
Construction is expected to begin in summer 2020, with the project estimated to be operational by 2022.
The funding breakdown for this project is:
	
$29 million from Environment and Parks
$1.37 million from Transportation
$14.5 million from the Government of Canada’s New Building Canada Fund
$4 million from the Town of Canmore

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




The total cost of divestment is $1.3 billion, less than the projected $1.8 billion cost of operating the program. This is also $200 million less than projected in Budget 2019.

“In the last election, we made a clear commitment to cancel the previous government’s risky deal made in the dying days of their government to spend billions on crude-by-rail contracts. We are saving Alberta taxpayers $500 million, and bringing an additional 120,000 barrels per day of egress online. It is also encouraging to hear that the private sector indicates this number will continue to grow under current market conditions.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“Shipping crude by rail is something the private sector is in the best position to be doing itself. Enabling industry-led rail capacity is an important aspect of ensuring sufficient market access for our resources. We promised Albertans that we would act in their best interest and transfer these contracts to industry.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy


“As a government, we are accountable to the taxpayer. We negotiated the best terms to get Albertans out of this tough situation. Industry is better able to manage the financial risk associated with the ebbs and flows of the marketplace. We will continue to make decisions that achieve the best outcomes for Albertans.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

By divesting all crude-by-rail contracts, an additional 120,000 barrels per day of takeaway capacity will come online. Facilities are already being used by industry to move crude oil. Having this additional capacity available to industry will help create the market conditions for companies to make positive investment decisions, such as increasing drilling or oil production.
In total, 19 contracts – for rail cars, loading and unloading capacity, logistics and other services – are being finalized by the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission (APMC), on behalf of government. Due to commercial confidentiality, additional details about the contracts cannot be released by government.
Quick facts

A government-operated crude-by-rail program was projected to cost $10.6 billion and bring in $8.8 billion in revenues, a loss of $1.8 billion.
Budget 2019 included a $1.5 billion allocation for the cost of divestment. Actual costs are $1.3 billion, $200 million less than the budget projection.
About 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day are currently exported from Canada via rail.
Divesting the crude-by-rail program will add 120,000 barrels per day of takeaway capacity.
Contracts cover all aspects of the crude-by-rail program, including rail cars, buffer cars, inspection and delivery fees, railway tolls, terminals, storage tanks, loading at terminals, interconnection, various taxes, customs, cross-border fees, and logistics.
The crude-by-rail program would have incrementally increased the amount of crude shipped by rail over a period of several months, starting in July 2019. It would not have hit the 120,000 per day threshold until summer 2020.

“Alberta’s economy is closely linked to our exports to the United States. As the largest exporter of energy to the U.S., we play a key role in continental energy security. It’s critical that we fight various efforts to block or decommission pipelines to the U.S. I was very happy to see strong bipartisan support for Alberta energy in the United States.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

While in Washington, Premier Kenney met with senior cabinet members to discuss pipelines and Alberta energy exports, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette, Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
The Premier advocated for further cooperation with Alberta on responsible energy production with Alaska Senator and Chair of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Lisa Murkowski.
Premier Kenney also discussed pipeline issues and new opportunities for expanding trade with the United States following the ratification of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, meeting with key officials such as U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue, Oregon Congressman Greg Walden, North Dakota Congressman Kelly Armstrong, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Montana Sen. Steve Daines, Nebraska Congressman Jeff Fortenberry, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.
Premier Kenney delivered a joint presentation with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe to the Wilson Center’s Canada Institute, led a roundtable discussion at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and joined fellow premiers at a panel discussion at the National Governors Association winter meeting.
In Montreal, Premier Kenney spoke to Quebecers about common interests and values that unite Alberta and Quebec.

“On the night our government was elected, I made a direct appeal to Quebecers to be partners in prosperity. I have maintained that important dialogue since forming government, and this trip to Montreal demonstrated that this conversation is making a difference. Albertans are generous and want to see our country succeed, together. We are proud to be able to support our friends in Quebec and Eastern Canada and, frankly, an overwhelming majority of Canadians prefer Alberta’s energy to alternatives from OPEC dictatorships.”
Jason Kenney, Premier   

While in Montreal, Premier Kenney also announced that the Government of Alberta will open an Alberta trade office to ensure Alberta’s interests are represented in Quebec.

On that day at approximately 3:30 a.m., an SUV that had been reported stolen, and which was being operated by the 21-year-old man, attracted the attention of CPS officers operating a marked police vehicle. Following that encounter, the stolen vehicle fled westbound at high speed on Country Hills Boulevard. The truck entered the intersection of Country Hills Boulevard and Metis Trail against a red light and collided with a pickup truck being operated by an off-duty CPS officer.
The man was pronounced dead on scene, while the off-duty officer was transported to hospital with serious injuries after receiving emergency medical treatment at the scene.
ASIRT investigators are asking anyone who was in the area of Country Hills Boulevard and Metis Trail at approximately 3:30 a.m. and witnessed these events to contact ASIRT by calling 403-592-4306.
ASIRT’s investigation will seek to determine whether the actions of any police officer caused or contributed to the death or serious injury that resulted from the collision. With ASIRT’s investigation underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Evaluation teams have started the review process and will be following standard scoring criteria in their analysis of almost 400 proposals submitted by proponents across Alberta totalling more than $240 million.
FRNs will provide families with consistent access to supports and services and ensure Alberta’s youngest citizens and their families have the resilience and strength to navigate what the future brings.

“The number and diversity of submissions we have received is a reflection of the enthusiasm and excitement we are seeing with the new model. We are in a strong position to develop a network of high-quality services that make it easier and more efficient for Albertans to get the support they need.”
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services

The proposals will be assessed based on organizational capacity, partnerships and collaboration, delivery plans, proposed budget and alignment to essential frameworks – particularly the Well-Being and Resiliency Framework and the miyo resource, which are based on world-leading brain science and cultural connection practice.

“We’ve heard from many community partners that this is the right thing to do and, while there will be some difficult decisions to make, we are confident this model will ultimately result in less overlap, less confusion and complexity, and ultimately better outcomes for children, youth and families across the province.”
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services

The evaluation will be followed by a program development process, which will help determine service delivery structures in each of the network areas across Alberta. Applicants will be notified of their submission acceptance status in mid-March before current contracts and grants end on March 31. As evaluation and negotiations progress, some communities may begin to see changes. However, the ministry will not negotiate in public. When networks are ready to launch in April, communities across Alberta will be informed through government announcements with successful grant recipients.
Quick facts

New Family Resource Networks will provide coordinated early intervention and prevention programs, will improve consistency in the service delivery approach and allow government to use taxpayer dollars more responsibly.
Improved coordination will eliminate duplication of services while improving outcomes for children, youth and families.

Budget 2020 will provide an update on the government’s fiscal and capital plans.

“I have listened to the comments that thousands of Albertans have shared with me and I hear your concerns about the need to continue to create jobs and grow the economy. Budget 2020 will report on our actions to date and our continued efforts to get Albertans back to work.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

To prepare for Budget 2020, government consulted with more than 30,000 Albertans through two telephone town halls. Ministers and MLAs have been meeting with their constituents and Albertans have shared their views through an online survey. More than 26,000 people provided feedback before the survey closed on Feb. 7.
The budget date allows sufficient time for government to debate and pass a budget before the end of the fiscal year and provides organizations that rely on government funding the time to make informed decisions about their own budgets.

“Budget 2020 is a continuation of our commitment to Albertans and the plan set forward in Budget 2019. We are focused on transforming government programs to eliminate duplication and ensuring realized savings are reinvested into services. I look forward to sharing our plan later this month.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

Efficient Grain Dryer Program helps farmers stay competitive after tough year.

The Efficient Grain Dryer Program is funded through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership and will help cover costs for eligible grain dryer improvements for farmers in Alberta only. Applicants will be able to choose equipment that makes sense for the size and volume of their agri-business and improve energy efficiency within their operations.

“I have a deep appreciation for the efforts being made by Canadian farmers to care for the land and environment. It is their legacy to their children. A sixth generation farmer recently told me, 'if you don't care for the land, you're not in business.’ We all know how hard 2019 was for many farmers, and that weather is increasingly unpredictable. Our government is listening and finding solutions for farmers.”
Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food


“Last harvest was one of the toughest for Alberta farmers. Poor weather, trade irritants, rail strikes and a carbon tax have all hurt farmers through no fault of their own. This new program will help farmers remain competitive and keep producing the best high-quality food in the world.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry

The program will be retroactive to April 1, 2018 to accommodate almost 100 applicants who have been waiting since that time and for those who may not have known about the program and purchased eligible equipment in the last two years.
Quick facts

$2 million dollars is available under the Efficient Grain Dryer Program.
The Canadian Agricultural Partnership is a five-year, $3-billion commitment by federal, provincial and territorial governments that supports Canada's agri-food and agri-products sectors.
Eligible expenses will be cost-shared, with 50 per cent funding from the grant and 50 per cent funding from the applicant.
The 2019 crop season was challenging for many Alberta producers. 
	
The season started with a dry spring and with variable weather over the summer. There was a lack of rainfall in the southern and eastern parts of the province and the extreme northern Peace Region, for example, and a long spell of cool, wet weather in other parts of the province.
Cold temperatures, snow and excess moisture in most parts of the province in the fall resulted in a long challenging harvest for crop and forage producers.


Based on the final Alberta Crop Report dated Dec. 3, about 10 per cent of crops across Alberta were left in the fields to be harvested in spring 2020.
	
Unharvested crops vary widely across the province – about two per cent remain in the fields in the southern region, seven per cent in central and northwest Alberta and 13 per cent in the northeast. In the Peace Region, about 32 per cent of crops are left to be combined in the spring.

(L to R) Bill Given, mayor, Grande Prairie, Leanne Beaupre, reeve, County of Grande Prairie, Dale Smith, reeve, Municipal District of Greenview, and Minister Nixon sign the memorandum of understanding for the Tri-Municipal Industrial Partnership, which will attract world-class investment to northwest Alberta.

Alberta has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Tri-Municipal Industrial Partnership (TMIP) to coordinate the development of a new eco-industrial area in Greenview, about 40 kilometres south of Grande Prairie.
The area will be a global energy and petrochemical manufacturing hub that will support jobs, attract international investment and showcase innovation in the region. The MOU sets the groundwork for future decisions, discussions and planning by the TMIP.

“We’re working with municipalities, Indigenous communities and the oil and gas industry to grow and diversify our economy in a way that is sustainable and innovation-focused. This collaboration presents an exciting opportunity to tap into the abundance of talent and potential this region has to offer while restoring investor confidence and sending a strong message that Alberta is open for business.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

The new area, which is already equipped with rail, road and pipeline infrastructure, will focus on attracting large-scale heavy industrial projects that also demonstrate cutting-edge technologies and environmentally conscious practices.

“With the signing of this agreement, the MD of Greenview and our TMIP partners are taking another collective step forward in building a strong, sustainable future for our residents and Albertans beyond our municipal boundaries. Northern Alberta continues to be the critical driver of our provincial and national economies, and Greenview is proud to join with the County of Grande Prairie, the City of Grande Prairie and the Alberta government to transform the full potential of our region into prosperity.”
Dale Smith, reeve, Municipal District of Greenview, and chair, Tri-Municipal Industrial Partnership

The MOU is the result of the TMIP’s work to prepare an Area Structure Plan to guide industrial development in the new eco-industrial area. Engagement played a vital role in developing the plan, which included input from the public, industry, Indigenous communities, financial institutions, utility providers, and municipal and provincial government representatives.

“We acknowledge the collaboration of our partners and extend thanks to the Government of Alberta for recognizing the steps we’ve taken to stimulate prosperity. This best-practice undertaking balances and respects Indigenous, environmental and historical concerns. It also contributes to diversifying Alberta’s petrochemical extraction economy into manufacturing. This memorandum of understanding demonstrates how three municipalities can join forces on an initiative to benefit an entire region.”
Leanne Beaupre, reeve, County of Grande Prairie 


“The City of Grande Prairie is proud to have been able to do our part to advance this strategic partnership, with the goal of creating an investment-ready zone that will boost the regional and provincial economy to the benefit of us all. We appreciate the provincial government’s support for the Tri-Municipal Industrial Partnership.”
Bill Given, mayor, City of Grande Prairie

Quick facts

The TMIP was formed in 2017 by the Municipal District of Greenview, the County of Grande Prairie and the City of Grande Prairie to work toward developing a world-class eco-industrial district.

“All individuals and organizations must abide by the law in Alberta and it is incumbent on government and all government agencies to enforce the law on behalf of Albertans.”

On Monday, Feb. 3, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its preliminary ruling. The reduced rates included in the decision are preliminary and therefore not legally binding until the final decision on anti-dumping and countervailing duties in August 2020.

“This is good news for Alberta. We know that Alberta is home to world-class forest companies and the United States remains an important customer for Canada. I'm pleased that preliminary indications show the U.S. lowering tariffs for Alberta and Canadian producers. Alberta's government will continue to defend its forestry sector in litigation and appeals under the North American Free Trade Agreement and World Trade Organization appeal processes. Reducing tariffs will increase the efficiency and economic output of our mills.”
Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry


“We are encouraged by this week’s preliminary determination but recognize there are still several steps ahead. That’s why we cannot lose sight of our ultimate goal to ensure Canadian softwood lumber is treated fairly and shown to create benefits on both sides of the border. Alberta will continue to support Canada in its ongoing efforts to push for the free flow of trade to ensure prosperity for both nations, and for Alberta’s forest industry.”
Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism

Quick facts

Every year, following the initial final tariff determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), an administrative review may be conducted to ensure that the tariff rates reflect the most current information on Canadian exports of softwood lumber to the United States. In the administrative review process, the USDOC may increase, decrease or eliminate their tariffs altogether.
For both the Anti-Dumping (AD) and Countervailing (CVD) First Administrative Review (AR1), the USDOC selected Canfor, Resolute and West Fraser as mandatory respondents. For CVD AR1, the USDOC also selected JD Irving Ltd. as a voluntary respondent.
On Jan. 31, the USDOC issued the following combined CVD and AD preliminary tariff rates for AR1:
	
Canfor: 4.95% (2017), 4.63% (2018)
West Fraser: 8.64% (2017), 9.08% (2018)
Resolute: 16.34% (2017), 15.84% (2018)
JD Irving: 5.13% (2017), 4.32% (2018)
All others: 8.37% (2017), 8.21% (2018)

“I want to be crystal clear. Albertans are proud people. We have never viewed our relationship with the federal government as one based on charity, and we’re not about to start now.
“Albertans want jobs, not an ‘aid package’ from Ottawa.
“Teck is not a political gift – it deserves to be approved on its merits. If the federal government takes seriously its commitment to science-driven, evidence-based decision-making, then it will accept the recommendation of the regulatory agencies and approve it. In our view, the federal cabinet’s pending decision on the independent joint review panel’s recommendation to approve Teck Frontier is in no way linked to Alberta’s ask regarding an equalization rebate (or other unrelated requests).
“The project has undergone a rigorous 10-year review, including a recommendation for approval from the independent federal regulator. Teck has played by the rules endorsed by Ottawa – including by the current federal government. To arbitrarily reject the project at the eleventh hour for political reasons would send a chilling signal to international investors.
“The Frontier project will directly employ up to 7,000 workers during construction and up to 2,500 workers during operation. An estimated $70 billion in taxes will be collected over the life of the mine, along with billions of dollars of economic activity that will ultimately spread throughout all of Alberta and Canada.
“All of the 14 directly affected First Nations have reached agreements with the company, and Frontier will provide large numbers of jobs for Indigenous Canadians. They recognize that responsible resource development can serve as a path to prosperity.
“Teck has committed to leading environmental standards for emissions, water and reclamation. The Teck Frontier project will have emissions of approximately one-half of the oilsands industry average, and lower carbon intensity than half of the oil currently refined in the United States. The company has also recently committed to going net zero by 2050.
“We do not view a decision on Frontier as something to be traded away or politicized. For us this issue goes beyond politics – Albertans want approval plain and simple.  
“Prime Minister Trudeau has emphasized his desire to work with Alberta and to preserve national unity. It’s time he backed up his words with action.
“Albertans are watching closely.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Feedback from the review will help inform Alberta’s first comprehensive continuing care legislation. Current continuing care legislation dates back to 1985 and includes six acts, six regulations and three standards. Currently, each stream of continuing care in Alberta – home care, supportive living and long-term care – is governed by its own legislation.

“Reviewing Alberta’s current continuing care legislation is part of our commitment to do everything we can to ensure aging and vulnerable Albertans have access to high-quality continuing care. We’re asking Albertans for input on how one piece of legislation can best support a variety of options for their loved ones in continuing care.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The new legislative framework will support a more responsive system that is better able to meet the needs of Albertans, while eliminating unnecessary barriers and reducing red tape. It is expected to be tabled in 2021.

“I’m honoured to lead engagement with key stakeholders about how we can improve Alberta’s continuing care legislation. Alberta seniors deserve to have access to supports and options that best meet their needs. I look forward to working with stakeholders and Albertans to explore how new legislation can improve the quality of life of their loved ones in continuing care.”
Richard Gotfried, MLA for Calgary-Fish Creek

In the coming months, Albertans and key stakeholders – including home care providers, facility operators and seniors’ organizations – will be informed of how they can provide input on topics that may include:

standards for health, personal and accommodation services
operators’ compliance with licensing requirements and standards
options for health-care practitioners so they can work to their full scope of practice
eligibility requirements across continuing care
alignment of programs and services across government
clarity of roles and responsibilities between government, Alberta Health Services and other partners to reduce overlap and duplication

Quick facts

Home care provides health and personal services to individuals in their own homes (single family homes, apartments, condominiums, lodges) and communities.
Designated supportive living provides accommodation, meals, and some health supports while still allowing residents to live independently in a home environment.
Long-term care, which includes nursing homes and auxiliary hospitals, provides care for people with complex medical needs who are unable to remain at home or in a supportive living facility.
There are almost 27,000 publicly funded facility-based continuing care spaces in Alberta (includes designated supportive living and long-term care).
More than 127,000 Albertans received home care services in 2018-19.

“The Public Service Commission has brought a common-sense proposal to the bargaining table that prioritizes service delivery over salary increases for the public sector.
“The proposal aligns with government’s commitment to Albertans to correct Alberta’s overspending problem so available tax dollars can be reinvested into high quality services we all rely on.
“Public sector wages account for more than half of government expenses. The facts are clear across many occupations in the public service: wages are significantly higher than those in other large provinces. Workers also enjoy compensation benefits that are not found in, or significantly more generous than, contracts in other provinces.
“Holding the line on public sector compensation will ensure workers continue to receive competitive wages while showing needed respect to other Albertans who have seen their wages disappear or their jobs lost completely.
“I have said many times that the need to align wages with other large provinces doesn’t diminish our respect for the exceptional work and dedication of public sector workers.
“As we move forward we all must work together for better services and a better future for all Albertans.”

Minister Pon, Minister Shandro, MLA Williams and MLA Horner with local representatives from Oyen, Spirit River and Manning.

The governments will provide a $37-million capital investment to build 173 new seniors lodge and continuing care spaces. These projects will create about 267 jobs.
The lodge partnership projects are a collaboration between Alberta Seniors and Housing and Alberta Health – combining seniors lodge and continuing care units in the same facility for a flexible range of care.

“Seniors built our province and they should be able to age in their own communities. We are proud to invest in these important projects that will help more seniors stay together and remain in the communities they love as their care needs change.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. This investment for the construction of safe and affordable housing in Oyen, Spirit River and Manning is going to make a positive impact – we’re giving seniors the ability to age in place in their own communities and maintain important communion with close family and friends which is vital to improved long-term health and happiness.”
Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation


“Seniors and people with disabilities need and deserve homes that support their individual needs and recognize the value of living near family and friends. These projects are part of a plan to continue to increase the number of continuing care spaces quickly and cost-effectively.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“I would like to thank Minister Pon and the Government of Alberta for reuniting my parents this past fall. Due to the placement ranking system and availability at the seniors lodge, my father was placed in acute care while my mother remained in the lodge, as they required different levels of care. You often hear of ‘divorce by nursing home’ and this was the case with my parents. Minister Pon quickly stepped up and demonstrated that she takes pride in taking care of seniors and was able to place my father in the same seniors lodge with my mother. This move allowed my parents to celebrate their 71st wedding anniversary together.”
Carol Sauchuk, family member

All projects are currently in the planning phase. Regional housing management bodies Acadia Foundation, Grande Spirit Foundation and North Peace Housing Foundation will operate the facilities.
Quick facts

The Government of Canada, through CMHC, and the Alberta government are investing in the rural lodge partnership through the Canada-Alberta bilateral agreement under the National Housing Strategy (NHS).
The Government of Canada is currently rolling out its NHS, an ambitious 10-year, $55-billion plan, that will create 125,000 new housing units and lift 530,000 families out of housing need, as well as repair and renew more than 300,000 housing units and reduce chronic homelessness by 50 per cent.
The NHS is built on strong partnerships between federal, provincial and territorial governments, and on continuous engagement with others, including municipalities, Indigenous governments and organizations, and the social and private sectors to make a meaningful difference in the lives of Canadians.

“Female genital mutilation is the ritual of cutting, piercing or removing the clitoris, and/or the sewing closed of the external genitals of women. There are no medical or health benefits. That’s why I’ve declared today as International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation.
“Our government is committed to preventing and addressing violence against women and girls in all its forms. Female genital mutilation is recognized internationally as a violation of human rights and can lead to long-term health complications for women and girls.
“We must work together with communities, educators and health providers to develop a deeper understanding of how to work cooperatively to end female genital mutilation and support survivors.
“By recognizing International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, we are able to have honest discussions about this debilitating practice that happens right here in Canada. We must all take a stand against cutting our beautifully perfect girls.”
Onyinye Chukwunyerenwa, a Calgary-based advocate for the prevention of child sexual abuse, added her perspective:

“Female genital mutilation is child sexual abuse and it has continued because we are silent. Let us therefore break the culture of silence.”


Madame Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine a fait la déclaration suivante au sujet de la Journée internationale de tolérance zéro pour les mutilations génitales féminines :
« La mutilation génitale féminine est un rituel qui consiste en l’excision, le perçage ou l'ablation du clitoris, ou encore la suture des organes génitaux externes de la femme. Cette pratique n’offre aucun avantage d’un point de vue médical ou sanitaire. C'est pourquoi je déclare aujourd’hui la Journée internationale de tolérance zéro pour les mutilations génitales féminines.
« Notre gouvernement s’est engagé à empêcher et à combattre la violence contre les femmes et les filles sous toutes ses formes. Les mutilations génitales féminines sont reconnues à l'échelle internationale comme une violation des droits de la personne, et elles peuvent entrainer des complications à long terme pour la santé des femmes et des filles.
« Nous devons travailler de concert avec les communautés, les éducateurs et les fournisseurs de soins de santé afin de mieux comprendre comment nous pouvons collaborer pour mettre fin aux mutilations génitales féminines et soutenir les survivantes.
« La reconnaissance de la Journée internationale de tolérance zéro pour les mutilations génitales féminines nous permet de tenir des discussions honnêtes sur cette pratique débilitante qui se produit ici même au Canada. Nous devons tous et toutes nous opposer à la mutilation de nos belles filles parfaites ».
Madame Onyinye Chukwunyerenwa, porte-parole de la prévention des abus sexuels sur les enfants de Calgary, a ajouté son point de vue :

« Les mutilations génitales féminines sont des abus sexuels sur les enfants, et elles se poursuivent parce que nous restons silencieux. Il nous faut briser la culture du silence. »

Forty students will be selected to form next year’s youth council to bring their diverse interests, backgrounds and perspectives from across the province and provide input on education topics.
Council members serve a 10-month term starting in September and ending in June 2021. They will meet with the Minister of Education and Alberta Education staff three times during the 2020-21 school year. There will also be opportunities for council members to interact with one another outside of meetings.
Youth council members will:

share diverse student perspectives with the Minister
build positive working relationships
work with one another and Alberta Education staff to provide input on education initiatives
participate in leadership opportunities

Students can apply on the Alberta Education student engagement page by March 18.

“I am lucky to have approximately 720,000 of the brightest minds in the country as my bosses. Student voice is invaluable to me. The current youth council has done amazing work so far and I always look forward to each meeting. I can’t wait to continue engaging with students who want to be a part of next year’s council.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

Minister Pon joined MLA Rowswell, Mayor McAuley and the Vermilion & District Housing Foundation to celebrate the grand opening of modernized seniors units.

The updated lodge, located 200 kilometres east of Edmonton, provides more modern, affordable housing for seniors with low income. With 124 units, the lodge provides home care and other services and amenities to ensure seniors can continue to live safely and independently in their chosen community.
Seniors and Housing Minister Josephine Pon joined Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Ahmed Hussen made the grand opening announcement.

“With the opening of the updated Vermilion Valley Lodge, seniors in the area now have more modern, affordable housing options so they can continue to live in their chosen community. Our government is pleased to partner in projects that support seniors and their families.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“Senior citizens have brought so many contributions to our society making sure that they have safe and affordable housing is one way to give back to them. This is why we are pleased to announce the completion of the newly renovated Vermilion Valley Lodge, a critical part of the community that will enable low-income seniors to age independently close to their family and friends in Vermilion.”
Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation


“Our community is excited to celebrate the modernization of our lodge which will provide a home to our seniors for many generations. We thank the Alberta government for their generous support and the Vermilion community who championed this project and raised $1.5 million to furnish the lodge. The response from residents and the community at large has been overwhelmingly positive and the residents love their new home.”
Caroline McAuley, mayor, Town of Vermilion, and board chair of Vermilion & District Housing Foundation

Quick facts

The community of Vermilion received a $10.5-million joint contribution from the governments of Alberta and Canada under the Investment in Affordable Housing Agreement.
The Government of Canada is currently rolling out its National Housing Strategy (NHS), an ambitious 10-year, $55-billion plan that will create 125,000 new housing units and lift 530,000 families out of housing need, as well as repair and renew more than 300,000 housing units and reduce chronic homelessness by 50 per cent.
The NHS is built on strong partnerships between federal, provincial and territorial governments, and on continuous engagement with others, including municipalities, Indigenous governments and organizations, and the social and private sectors to make a meaningful difference in the lives of Canadians.

“February is Heart Month, when we raise awareness of the importance of maintaining and improving heart health – something we can all do for ourselves and for our communities.
“Heart disease is the leading cause of premature death for women in Canada and the second highest cause of death overall.
“My ministry is working with Alberta Health Services on an assessment of initiatives that show great promise to reduce the risk for Albertans. This work will identify the most effective community programs for early detection, treatment and control of heart disease, and allow reinvestment in the most effective activities.
“We’re building on a long record of leadership in cardiac care. Our clinicians and treatment are second to none – they’re trusted by patients and families and a source of pride for all Albertans.
“We can all do our part to help reduce the devastating impacts of heart disease. Know your risks and reduce them by maintaining a healthy weight, making healthy food choices, staying active, living smoke-free, minimizing alcohol consumption, and getting advice and help when you need it.
“This Heart Month, I encourage all Albertans to take time to learn about your heart disease risk factors and what steps you can take to decrease them. And take a minute to find out more from the Heart and Stroke Foundation.”

“This independent public sector wage arbitration outcome of zero increase reflects the current economic realities in the province. This decision helps keep government on track with our commitment to Albertans to prioritize service delivery over salary increases for public sector workers.
“It is also respectful of the economic challenges so many other Albertans have recently faced – seeing their wages decrease or disappear altogether.
“Public sector compensation accounts for more than half of all government expenses and in many cases public sector workers in Alberta earn significantly more than peers in other provinces.
“Sustaining high quality services requires common sense collective agreements that over time bring Alberta’s spending on public sector wages in line with other provinces.
“This fiscal restraint and discipline must continue as we enter into new collective bargaining negotiations in 2020. The need for wage restraint does not diminish our recognition for the hard work public sector workers do for Albertans.
“Our goal as we move forward with upcoming negotiations is to do so cooperatively, not combatively.”

While the Local Authorities Election Act was reviewed and revised following local elections in 2017, government continues to receive feedback suggesting gaps exist in the legislation. As a result, government wants to hear from Albertans – including voters, elected officials, community advocacy groups and campaign volunteers – on how the rules can be improved to enhance transparency and participation in local elections.

“Albertans expect local elections to be fair, transparent and inclusive. This consultation will determine if and how we, as a government, can better meet these goals. While this will not be a wholesale review like the one in 2018, we are looking to Albertans for feedback on areas that can be improved before the next round of municipal and school board elections.”
Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs

Take the survey online
From Feb. 4 to March 4, Albertans can provide their feedback online at Alberta.ca about:

the length of campaign period
nomination process
campaign finances
third-party advertising
recall of municipally elected officials

Government will also hold focused discussions with representatives from municipalities and community advocacy groups.
Feedback may be used to inform potential changes to the legislation, which could be brought forward in a future session of the legislature.
Quick facts

The Local Authorities Election Act governs elections for cities, towns, villages, summer villages, municipal districts, counties, specialized municipalities and school boards.
Metis Settlements and irrigation districts also use the act to conduct their elections. This review, however, does not include parts of the legislation that pertain to Metis Settlements and irrigation districts.

Earlier that day, at approximately 6 p.m., EPS members observed a robbery in progress involving two male youths, one of whom was armed with what appeared to be a firearm. The officers requested additional resources and the area was contained, with the youth observed to have entered a nearby residence.
At approximately 7 p.m., the youth emerged from the residence and a confrontation occurred with EPS members. During this incident, one EPS member discharged a round from an ARWEN less-lethal device, and a second member discharged a single round from his carbine. The youth sustained an injury to his lower body and was taken into custody with the assistance of additional EPS members. A replica firearm was recovered from the scene of the incident.
 
The youth received emergency medical treatment on scene before being transported to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. No one else was injured during the course of this incident.
With ASIRT’s investigation well underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

Government is investing $5.2 million to redevelop the existing Stoney Creek Lodge to accommodate the new living spaces. Two ministries, Seniors and Housing and Health, work together to identify communities where existing seniors lodges can be redeveloped to incorporate continuing care.
The project is a partnership with government and Alberta Health Services (AHS), the Camrose and Area Lodge Authority and the Bethany Group. The Bethany Group will operate the facility and partner with AHS to provide the health services.
Construction is expected to begin later this year and create 38 jobs.

“It is so important that seniors receive the supports they need to remain in their community of choice. Our government is proud to invest in this project that will bring more continuing care services to seniors in Camrose and area, and we are grateful for the support of our partners. I am also pleased to see that this project will create jobs and help our economy grow while getting Albertans back to work.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“This project is part of our government’s commitment to increase access to continuing care quickly and cost-effectively. Adding spaces to existing seniors lodges is a common-sense solution that comes from strong partnerships between government and community agencies. I’m thrilled that more seniors in the Camrose area will be able to access the care they need in their own community.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“We are appreciative to the Government of Alberta for its contribution to the care of seniors in our community. The Stoney Creek Lodge has a long history of excellent service for seniors and this refurbishment project will improve the quality of life for many more in the Camrose region.”
Norm Mayer, mayor, City of Camrose


“We are delighted that the Stoney Creek facility gets a new lease on life and will continue to serve those in Camrose and surrounding area. The Camrose and Area Lodge Authority looks forward to seeing the development of this project.”
Max Lindstrand, chair, Camrose and Area Lodge Authority


“The addition of 40 beds for designated supportive living is a welcome one, serving both the needs of residents and creating new jobs for its ongoing operation. As the community and surrounding area changes so does its needs, and the redevelopment of an existing building to support the residents of Camrose and the county makes sense.”
Odell Olson, chair, the Bethany Group

“This is a victory for common sense and the rule of law. We are pleased the Federal Court of Appeal made a fair decision. This ruling confirms what we’ve known all along: the Trans Mountain expansion project has been held to the highest standard at every turn.
“Now that this legal hurdle has been cleared, there is absolutely no denying that it’s time to get this pipeline built. TMX will result in billions of dollars of economic prosperity for Canadians and create well-paying jobs throughout the country.
“While we respect the opinion of those who have voiced opposition to the project, the fact is the majority of First Nations communities – and the majority of Canadians – want to share in the economic benefits of responsible resource development. That’s demonstrated by the 58 mutual benefit agreements that Trans Mountain has signed with Indigenous communities across Alberta and British Columbia.
""We particularly appreciate the clarity in the decision that the duty to consult does not equal a veto.
“This marks an important milestone for TMX, but we won’t get ahead of ourselves. Completion of construction remains the one true measure of success. We will hold our celebrations until oil is flowing through the pipeline.
“Our government will continue to stand up for Alberta by advocating for increased market access and protecting the value of our energy exports to grow our economy and create jobs.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




 
Minister of Children’s Services Rebecca Schulz meets with children at Kids3 Daycare in Edmonton during the new online subsidy application tool announcement event on February 4.

The new application site allows parents to easily check if they are eligible and apply for child care subsidy using any computer, tablet or smart phone. This means fewer paper submissions, emails and phone calls for support, reducing red tape and allowing staff to focus more time on supporting children and families and less on helping them with paperwork.  

“The new subsidy system is an innovative step that allows parents to file their application easier and quicker than before through a modern, secure and user-friendly system. This is a common-sense and long overdue change to help parents get the support they need.”
Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services


“This new application is a great example of the work we’re doing to reduce red tape and make government processes more efficient. It will streamline the process, making it easier for parents to easily navigate child care subsidies. This will allow government staff to be more efficient so they can spend more time on higher value work, which ultimately saves tax payer dollars.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction

This new application site was tested with Albertans and front-line service staff to ensure the most effective tool for families.

“The new subsidy application is an easier and more convenient process and helps to lessen anxiety, stress and hassle. It lets you know if you are eligible or not and estimates how much you’ll receive right on the spot. Subsidy has made a big difference to our family so that we can work full-time.”
Michelle and Robert Junio, Edmonton parents

Red Tape Reduction
The new online application supports the Alberta government’s commitment to cutting red tape, reducing the regulatory burden on businesses and making life easier for all Albertans. To track our progress, or if you have a suggestion about where we can cut even more red tape, please visit CutRedTape.Alberta.ca.
Online and secure
Parents access the service using a MyAlberta Digital ID to ensure their information and personal privacy are safe and secure. MyAlberta Digital ID is a single, verified online identity for interacting with digital government programs and services. Accounts are free and allow parents to start their application and come back to complete it later.
The app development was the first major project of the Alberta Digital Innovation Office, in conjunction with Service Alberta, which was created to drive digital transformation and innovation across government.

“I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the tireless work of our oncology doctors, nurses and staff – our front line of hope and courage for patients and their families. Alberta is fortunate to have some of the best cancer treatment programs and skilled professionals in the country.
“Also, I wish to thank the thousands of Albertans who volunteer and donate to assist the work of the many organizations supporting patients, families, research and cancer prevention.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Lloydminster RCMP had been investigating a complaint of a stolen vehicle, and received information from the owner of the vehicle that it had been observed driving in Lloydminster. RCMP members located the vehicle just west of the city. An encounter occurred between the occupants of the vehicle and members of the RCMP, during which the vehicle left the road and one police officer discharged his service pistol.
The vehicle returned to the road and fled from police, who pursued and maintained intermittent contact with the vehicle until it was once again located in the area of the 4200 block of 56 Avenue in Lloydminster. At that location, officers approached the vehicle and another altercation occurred, during which another police officer discharged his service pistol.
The 27-year-old driver of the vehicle was pronounced dead at the scene, and two RCMP members were taken to hospital as a result of their injuries. The female occupant of the vehicle was uninjured and was taken into custody by the RCMP.
Investigators are asking anyone who may have witnessed either of the incidents in which a firearm was discharged and anyone who may have taken video of those incidents to contact ASIRT at 780-644-1483.
ASIRT’s investigation will focus on the actions of police during this incident, while the RCMP will maintain responsibility for the investigation into the circumstances that led up to the incident, as well as the surviving occupant of the vehicle. As the investigation is underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

Health Minister Tyler Shandro, Alberta Health Services President & CEO Verna Yiu, and Ernst & Young National Health Care Leader John Bethel speak to the release of the AHS Review Report.

The review is the first in 10 years, since Alberta Health Services was formed. The report contains 57 recommendations and 72 savings opportunities to improve the quality and long-term sustainability of health services.

“The AHS review is a key commitment to Albertans, and I’m very excited about moving forward with implementation. Every dollar we save will be put right back into the health system to deliver on our promise to improve access and make the system work better for patients. It’s about freeing up administrative resources so we can spend more directly on Albertans’ health care.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The recommendations address four key areas: people, clinical services, non-clinical services and governance. The government accepts the report, with two important exceptions: there will be no hospital closures or consolidation of urban trauma centres.
The report identifies a range of long-term savings initiatives with the potential to save between $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion annually.
Stakeholder input into the review process far exceeded any similar projects that Ernst & Young LLP (EY) has conducted across Canada. Staff engagement included feedback from about 1,200 physicians, 27,000 front-line staff and 4,200 AHS leaders.  
Over the next 100 days, AHS will engage staff and clinical leaders as it develops a long-term implementation plan.

“AHS takes its responsibilities as fiscal stewards of taxpayer dollars seriously. We will continue to find efficiencies and increase outcomes for Albertans. This report is a tool that can help us do that. Implementing many of the opportunities will take time and resources – including financial resources. The board has full confidence in the AHS team, and we will do this work in partnership with all Albertans, including physicians, staff, communities, patients and their families.”
David Weyant, board chair, Alberta Health Services

Quick facts

Engagement as part of the review included:
	
about 32,500 AHS staff and physician survey responses
1,000 emails from Albertans
more than 75 health system stakeholder engagement sessions
five zone-based operational leader sessions


An overwhelming 90% of AHS staff survey respondents agreed that protecting and strengthening the sustainability of Alberta’s health system should be a key AHS priority.  
The cost of the contract with EY to conduct the review was just over $2 million.
EY was mandated to investigate opportunities to reduce costs and improve performance by:
	
examining AHS’s structure and organization
evaluating AHS programs, services and policies
identifying ways to make AHS operations more responsive to the front lines and Albertans
comparing AHS to other provinces’ health systems and best practices
gathering input from employees, physicians and the public


AHS is the provincial health authority responsible for planning and delivering health supports and services for more than four million adults and children in Alberta.
AHS has about 102,000 direct employees and a budget of $15.4 billion.

“One in four Canadians are living with mental health challenges and more than a million of them are children. Fewer than 20 per cent of these children, however, are getting the treatment they need. The statistics are shocking, and the situation is desperate for families and communities as they support kids in crisis.
“There is hope. As Albertans well know, the only thing stronger than a crisis is the resilient courage of those who overcome it. This year’s theme for Children’s Mental Health Week is ‘Find your brave.’ I can’t think of a more fitting theme.
“It takes courage for a vulnerable young person to ask for help. It takes even more courage to pursue long-term recovery. No less courageous are the families, friends and communities who remind every child that fighting mental illness doesn’t have to be lonely.
“No matter how dark things seem, comfort and healing are available. Kids, teens and post-secondary students have access to a growing range of provincially funded early interventions and supports that are so critical to their health and happiness.
“With courage and compassion, let’s continue to show our young people that they’re not broken, they’re not alone, and life-saving help is in reach.”

The Feb. 3-9 trip builds on government’s work to drive investment, expand Alberta exports and get pipelines built.

“Alberta’s economic future depends on new private sector investment. That’s why I have put a priority on meeting with key investors to tell them about the tremendous opportunities that exist in Alberta, and the policies that are making us one of the most competitive places for job creation in North America. That’s what I will be doing in Montreal.
“We also have critical issues at play with our largest trading partner, the United States. That’s why I will be travelling to Washington, D.C., to meet with state governors and key congressional and administration officials. I will be discussing the future of NAFTA and the construction of pipelines, like Line 3 and Keystone XL, while in the U.S. capital.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

In Montreal, the Premier will speak to a roundtable of top business leaders, and will meet with CEOs of some of Canada’s largest corporations. He will also conduct several media interviews to underscore how all Canadians benefit from a thriving energy sector, and why Alberta is a preferred source of energy in both environmental and social terms.
While in Washington, Premier Kenney will attend meetings hosted by the National Governors Association, along with Ontario Premier Doug Ford, Quebec Premier François Legault and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe. He will hold bilateral meetings with governors of U.S. states with strong ties to the Alberta economy, and with members of the House of Representatives, the senate, and the administration.
Premiers Kenney and Moe will deliver a joint presentation to the Wilson Center’s Canada Institute, and Premier Kenney will meet with the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, and the School of Advanced International Studies.
Three political staff will support the Premier’s mission at a total estimated cost of $32,000.

Premier Jason Kenney, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions Jason Luan, local MLAs, and recovery advocates celebrate a historic investment in addiction treatment spaces.

The province is providing up to $4.3 million per year to fund treatment spaces at Fresh Start Recovery Centre and Sunrise Healing Lodge, both in Calgary, and Thorpe Recovery Centre near Lloydminster. This historic investment will expand access to addiction treatment and supports to give Albertans more options for recovery.

“If you or a loved one are struggling with addiction, please know the Alberta government is working for you. We will continue to add publicly funded mental health and addiction treatment spaces across the province because we believe all Albertans should have access to life-saving treatment, regardless of their financial situation.”
Jason Kenney, Premier


“I am pleased to partner with such reputable and respected residential addiction treatment providers to create much-needed publicly funded treatment spaces. Our government is ensuring every Albertan who needs it can get the opportunity to get well and find their path to long-term recovery, regardless of where they live.”
Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addiction

Fresh Start Recovery Centre will receive up to $1.56 million per year to fund 294 more treatment spaces over the next three years.

""Over the course of my career in the addiction recovery field – spanning more than three decades – I have not witnessed this kind of government operational funding commitment. This kind of support for abstinence-based treatment and long-term recovery is unprecedented. Not only is there a recognition of what it takes to support a recovery-oriented system of care, but decisive action and investment to supporting this system for Albertans. This is a game changer!""
Stacey Petersen, executive director, Fresh Start Recovery Centre

Up to $518,300 per year will fund 156 more treatment spaces over the next three years at Sunrise Healing Lodge.

“By dedicating funds to our already existing and historically underfunded recovery-oriented centres, our provincial government is allowing recovery-based treatment centres such as Sunrise and our brother and sister agencies to operate at full capacity, ensuring that we can make our services available to as many as possible.”
Leslie Big Bull, executive director, Sunrise Healing Lodge Society

Thorpe Recovery Centre will receive up to $2.21 million per year to fund 574 more treatment spaces over the next three years. This includes both residential addiction treatment and medical detox spaces.

“The government needs to be recognized for its commitment to eliminating barriers to recovery. We have been struggling with empty beds to fill and a wait list over six months long, knowing we could be doing more for these people. However, without a proper funding model, we were unable to support them. This announcement couldn't come at a better time. We are so grateful to be a provider of treatment in Alberta and are proud to be helping more of our community in need.”
Teressa Krueckl, chief executive officer, Thorpe Recovery Centre

This initiative is part of government’s $140-million commitment to recovery-oriented addiction and mental health care.

“The black community in Alberta has a long and varied history – from the homesteaders who travelled north from the United States to build a safe, free home for themselves and their families, to those who continue to come to Canada from around the world in search of a new beginning.
“This month, we celebrate the contributions of Albertans of African and Caribbean heritage to our cultural vibrancy and economic prosperity. We also reflect on the discrimination and prejudice they have faced in Canada and around the world. 
“To celebrate and raise awareness of this important piece of Alberta’s history, the Alberta Government is hosting an event in Edmonton on February 13 and one in Calgary on February 19. Through a short film screening, a panel of speakers and a display of archival records, we will explore our shared past, better understand the current environment, and reflect on how we can continue to embrace and support our province’s cultural diversity. When we connect on a personal level and make an effort to truly understand each other, we are able to work together to end discrimination.”

Madame Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine, a fait la déclaration suivante à l'occasion du Mois de l'histoire des Noirs :
« En plus d’exister depuis longtemps, l’histoire de la communauté noire de l’Alberta est marquée d’une grande diversité – depuis les homesteaders qui ont mis le cap vers le nord en provenance des États-Unis afin de s’établir et de créer un foyer sûr et libre pour eux-mêmes et leur famille, jusqu’à ceux et celles qui continuent de venir au Canada en provenance du monde entier en quête d’un nouveau départ.  
« Ce mois-ci, nous célébrons les Albertains et des Albertaines d’origine africaine et antillaise, qui contribuent à notre dynamisme culturel et à notre prospérité économique. Nous nous penchons aussi sur la discrimination et les préjugés auxquels ils sont confrontés au Canada et ailleurs dans le monde. 
« Pour célébrer cet important pan de l’histoire de l’Alberta et y sensibiliser la population, le gouvernement de l’Alberta sera l’hôte d’événements qui se tiendront à Edmonton le 13 février et à Calgary le 19 février prochains. La projection d’un court métrage, un panel de conférenciers et une exposition d’archives nous permettront de mettre en commun notre passé, de mieux comprendre l’environnement dans lequel nous vivons aujourd’hui et de mener une réflexion sur la façon dont nous pouvons continuer de valoriser et d’appuyer la diversité culturelle de notre province. Lorsqu’on va à la rencontre des uns des autres et que nous faisons l'effort de se comprendre vraiment, nous sommes en mesure de travailler ensemble pour mettre fin à la discrimination. »

“This month, we join Canada and the wider world in celebrating Black History Month. Alberta is home to more than 70,000 members of the black community, and we are blessed by their ongoing contributions to our economy, our culture and our shared history.
“Albertans of Afro-Caribbean origin have built a long, proud legacy in our province. Whether pursuing adventure as settlers or seeking freedom from persecution, they found a new life and the promise of prosperity here in Alberta. Since then, the black community has enhanced Alberta’s diversity and strengthened our commitment to free people, free thought and free enterprise.
“I encourage Albertans of all backgrounds to learn more about black history in Alberta, and to reflect on the accomplishments of pioneering former slaves like William Allen, and groundbreakers like Violet King Henry, Canada’s first black female lawyer.
“I hope everyone will take time to reflect on the incredible achievements of black Albertans, and to appreciate the home we’ve all created together by choice and not by chance.”

“Today, a provincial board of arbitration awarded no increase to Auxiliary Nursing Care workers, a one per cent increase to Alberta Public Service workers and a one per cent increase to health care workers in General Support Services.
“This binding arbitration process agreed to by the previous government resulted in public sector wage decisions that further challenge the urgent need to fix Alberta’s overspending problem while ensuring the long-term sustainability of high quality public services Albertans rely on.
“These increases - while much less than the 6.5 per cent to nearly eight per cent increases the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees was seeking - will mean an additional $35 million annual expenditure for public sector compensation. As indicated in the last budget, there is no new money for public sector raises over the course of our fiscal plan.
“As a result of these decisions government will need to consider additional steps to balance our budget and get our fiscal house in order. These unfortunately include the potential for adjustments to workforce levels, as well as finding efficiencies in program service delivery.
“As the MacKinnon panel identified, public sector compensation makes up more than half of government expenses and in many cases wages are substantially higher than other large provinces.
“We remain steadfast. We will not ask Alberta taxpayers to further fund public sector raises when far too many workers in the private sector have lost their jobs or have seen significant cuts in their wages.
“Wage restraint will be of paramount importance as we enter into new collective bargaining negotiations in 2020.
“We have a great deal of respect and admiration for Alberta’s public sector workers who deliver so many of the vital services Albertans rely on. The need for restraint does not diminish our recognition of the hard work they do for Albertans, but government is expected to be responsible stewards of the public’s tax dollars and get our province’s finances under control.”

Seniors and Housing Minister Josephine Pon tours the construction site of a new facility that will replace the oldest seniors lodge in Alberta.

Government is investing $28.3 million to replace Piper Creek Lodge – the oldest lodge in Alberta. Construction is well underway, with foundations installed and walls up. Once complete, the new facility will allow seniors to access additional care without having to move.

“I am pleased to see this new facility is ahead of schedule. Not only will this project replace Alberta’s oldest lodge with a more modern, spacious version, seniors will be able to more easily access increased levels of care, reducing their stress and improving their quality of life.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“Affordable housing for seniors in Red Deer and central Alberta is critical to ensuring our citizens can continue to live and age near their friends and family in the city they call home. The Piper Creek Lodge is the oldest lodge in Alberta, and with this funding from the Government of Alberta, local seniors are assured a continuum of options that will meet their needs as they age. This project has been a vision many years in the making, and the city supports it becoming our community reality.”
Tara Veer, mayor, City of Red Deer


“We are very excited to see the development of the new lodge moving along so quickly. This is a testament to the partners involved, and their commitment to seniors housing.”
Steve Christie, board chair, Bridges Community Living

Of the 90 units, 25 are for independent residents, while the remaining 65 lodge units will have access to additional services, such as housekeeping and meals.
Residents are expected to begin moving into the new facility in spring 2021.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Alberta Health Services has posted an expression of interest to gauge the interest and ability of independent facilities to provide more publicly funded surgeries. This work is part of the Alberta Surgical Wait-Times Initiative, an ambitious commitment to provide all medically necessary surgeries within clinically appropriate times by funding 80,000 more surgeries in hospitals and independent clinics over the next three years.

“We’re eager to hear from independent providers who want to help us improve access. They already perform thousands of surgeries for Albertans, providing safe care that’s convenient for patients and reduces costs. We’re going to make the best use of hospitals and independent providers to give every patient the right care in the right setting, and give Albertans the best access to surgery in Canada.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

The increase in surgeries will be funded from efficiencies identified by the AHS Review. The province’s overall health spending this year will be $22.1 billion, the highest ever and an increase of $200 million from last year. Savings across the Ministry of Health will supplement the budget increase to offset population growth and other increases in demand for health services.
Last year, 42 of 80 independent providers (also known as non-hospital surgical facilities) in the province provided about 40,000 publicly funded surgeries under contract with AHS at no cost to patients. The province and AHS want to hear from existing independent providers, as well as new ventures, to see if they have capacity to perform more procedures starting as early as fall 2020.

“Developed collaboratively, the Alberta Surgical Wait-Times Initiative reflects the input of patient advisors, operational leaders, physicians, surgical teams and quality improvement programs. This initiative is a complex endeavour and requires collaboration across the whole health system. As part of that collaboration, we’re working with non-hospital surgical facilities to increase capacity, which will be a critical part of this initiative.”
Dr. Francois Belanger, vice-president, quality and chief medical officer, Alberta Health Services

AHS is also exploring if independent clinics could provide surgeries that are currently performed exclusively in hospitals, such as hip and knee replacements. Right now, non-hospital surgical facilities perform low-risk day surgeries. As independent clinics take on a wider range of surgeries, they will free up capacity in hospitals for emergency surgeries and more-complex procedures.
Respondents have until Feb. 28 to submit their expressions of interest.
Later this spring, a request for proposals will move forward with formal applications from interested respondents.
Quick facts

Currently, about 293,000 surgeries are completed in Alberta each year.
Hospitals provide about 260,000 of these surgeries, or about 85 per cent, with non-hospital surgical facilities performing the remaining 15 per cent.
All non-hospital surgical facilities must be accredited by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and follow safety and quality standards.
All surgeries, whether they are done in public hospitals or under contract in independent clinics, are performed by accredited surgeons and health staff at no cost to patients.

Minister Pon, Minister Sawhney and Minister Wilson announce funding for new housing units to support people at risk of homelessness in Lethbridge.

The permanent supportive housing project will help people with addiction, mental health and other social and physical challenges.
The Alberta government and the Government of Canada, through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, will jointly contribute $11 million to build 42 new housing units through the Canada-Alberta bilateral agreement under the National Housing Strategy (NHS).

“Safe and supportive housing is vital for at-risk people. We are proud to invest in this important project for Lethbridge and are grateful for the support of the federal government, City of Lethbridge and other community partners.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“Our government is dedicated to helping those in need, which is why we are proud to invest in this project in Lethbridge. These new, permanent supportive housing units provide more than just safe and stable places to live, as critical on-site social services will be offered to give residents the tools they need to build a better life for themselves.”
Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)


“We are committed to supporting vulnerable Albertans to break the cycle of homelessness to ensure opportunities for inclusion, stability and participation in their communities. I am pleased we are able to support this project.”
Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services


“We all know urban Indigenous people make up a disproportionately higher percentage of people experiencing homelessness in Alberta – and Lethbridge is no exception. I am thrilled to know that there will be more housing units made available which will offer supports to help alleviate these numbers and stem the tide of other social issues that arise from homelessness.”
Rick Wilson, Minister of Indigenous Relations


“We are extremely thankful to the Alberta government for placing a priority on affordable housing for Lethbridge residents who need it. We can now begin to move forward in a tangible way while addressing the serious social issues in our city.”
Chris Spearman, mayor, City of Lethbridge

Seniors and Housing will support the development of the facility, while Community and Social Services will be responsible for the on-site social supports.
Planning and design work is underway and construction will begin later this year. Lethbridge Housing Authority will operate the facility. The project will create about 80 jobs.
Quick facts

The Government of Canada is rolling out its NHS, an ambitious 10-year, $55-billion plan that will create 100,000 new housing units and lift 530,000 families out of housing need, as well as repair and renew more than 300,000 housing units and reduce chronic homelessness by 50 per cent.
NHS is built on strong partnerships between federal, provincial and territorial governments, and on continuous engagement with others, including municipalities, Indigenous governments and organizations, and the social and private sectors to make a meaningful difference in the lives of Canadians.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Since being elected, government has focused on attracting investment and sending a strong message that Alberta is open for business. Initiatives such as the Job Creation Tax Cut and special production allowance on crude oil are spurring investment in Alberta’s energy sector. 

“I am extremely pleased to see capital investment beginning to return to our province. Government is taking concrete steps to show that Alberta is open for business and results like this prove our plan is working. This increased investment of $2 billion will support approximately 8,100 jobs here in Alberta and 3,700 jobs in the rest of Canada. Alberta’s energy industry already provides more than 533,000 jobs across the country.”
Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy


“We are very happy to see an increase in capital investment expected for 2020. It’s a reflection of the hard work and determination on many fronts to bring the industry into a more competitive position. That includes the corporate tax cut by the Government of Alberta, and incenting crude by rail under curtailment, which is helping to attract business and investment.”
Tim McMillan, president and CEO, CAPP 

The Job Creation Tax Cut has reduced Alberta’s corporate tax rate to 10 per cent – the lowest across Canada – and it will continue to be reduced until 2022.
These combined actions are returning Alberta to a predictable, attractive place for investment and promoting future job growth.
Editor's note: Figures updated to include total energy investment in Alberta, rather than only conventional oil investment.

Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and Curriculum Advisory Panel Member Dr. Glenn Feltham with students from St. Marguerite School in Calgary.

A new online survey is available until Feb. 24 for Albertans to provide input on the draft vision for student learning. Input received through the survey will be used to inform a new ministerial order on student learning – a document that will define the vision, values, foundations and outcomes for education in Alberta. Feedback collected on the draft vision will also help guide government’s work moving forward with updating the curriculum.

“We committed to improving the education system so our students receive an education that equips them with the skills they need to succeed in life. As part of the curriculum review process, we committed to broadening consultation to hear a wider range of perspectives. With the hard work of the curriculum advisory panel, I am pleased to be at this point in the process where Albertans can provide their feedback on the draft vision for student learning. Setting a new vision for student learning is an important first step in ensuring we take the right approach in updating the provincial curriculum.”
Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education

The independent curriculum advisory panel was established in August 2019. Its 12 members have diverse experiences and perspectives that have guided them in drafting a new vision for education and providing a recommendations report on the future direction of curriculum. The panel’s recommendations are centred around the themes of curriculum development, curriculum content and assessment, in addition to some recommendations specific to the draft K-4 curriculum that was publicly released in 2018.
The panel’s full report is publicly available online. Some highlights include:

ensuring the curriculum remains free from the prescription of pedagogical approaches, like discovery math
addressing financial literacy, work readiness, wellness and goal-setting to enhance students’ life skills
implementing standardized assessment tools to evaluate literacy and numeracy in Grades 1 through 5
aligning the draft K-4 curriculum from 2018 with the new vision for student learning
providing students with work-integrated learning opportunities
ensuring First Nations, Metis and Inuit learnings continue to be reflected in our curriculum


“On behalf of all panel members, I’m delighted to have been part of Alberta’s curriculum review process. We recognize that all our students need an education that ensures they thrive in an environment of rapid economic, social and global change. We are counting on our young people to help create a province where all Albertans flourish. While there are elements of the draft K-12 curriculum that serve us well, there is room for improvement. The curriculum advisory panel offered up recommendations to help ensure students have the foundational knowledge, skills and competencies they will need beyond high school to live their best lives.”
Angus McBeath, chair, curriculum advisory panel


“We approached our mandate with one crucial question in mind – what are the key knowledge and skills students should have when they complete high school? From addressing financial literacy to ensuring curriculum is free from the prescription of pedagogical approaches, we believe that these recommendations will help the government move forward as they work to modernize Alberta’s education system.”
Jen Panteluk, vice-chair, curriculum advisory panel

The curriculum advisory panel’s report provides advice that is separate from the survey, which focuses on the draft vision for student learning. The panel’s recommendations will be considered along with Albertans’ feedback on the draft vision to inform next steps in updating the curriculum.

Un comité consultatif nommé par le gouvernement a remis ses recommandations pour le curriculum et a ébauché une nouvelle vision pour l’apprentissage des élèves qui aidera à façonner l’orientation relative à l’éducation.
Un nouveau sondage en ligne est accessible jusqu’au 24 février afin de permettre aux Albertains de donner leur avis sur l’ébauche de la vision pour l’apprentissage des élèves. Les commentaires recueillis par le sondage serviront à éclairer un nouvel arrêté ministériel sur l’apprentissage des élèves – un document qui définira la vision, les valeurs, les fondements et les résultats en matière d’éducation en Alberta. La rétroaction reçue sur l’ébauche de la vision appuiera également le travail du gouvernement relatif à la mise à jour du curriculum.

« Nous nous sommes engagés à améliorer le système d’éducation pour que nos élèves reçoivent une éducation qui leur fournit les habiletés dont ils ont besoin pour réussir tout au long de la vie. Dans le cadre du processus de révision du curriculum, nous nous sommes engagés à élargir la consultation afin de recueillir un plus grand éventail de perspectives. Grâce au travail acharné du comité consultatif sur le curriculum, je suis ravie que nous en soyons à ce stade du processus où les Albertains peuvent offrir leur rétroaction sur l’ébauche de la vision pour l’apprentissage des élèves. La définition d’une nouvelle vision pour l’apprentissage des élèves représente une première étape importante pour veiller à ce que nous adoptions la bonne approche quant à la mise à jour du curriculum provincial. »
Adriana LaGrange, ministre de l’Éducation

Le comité consultatif indépendant sur le curriculum a été mis sur pied en aout 2019. Les 12 membres qui le composent ont des expériences et des perspectives variées qui les ont guidés dans l’élaboration d’une nouvelle vision pour l’éducation et dans l’élaboration d’un rapport proposant des recommandations sur l’orientation future du curriculum. Les recommandations du comité s’articulent autour des thèmes de l’élaboration du curriculum, du contenu du curriculum et de l’évaluation, en plus de certaines recommandations particulières à l’ébauche du curriculum M à 4 qui a été rendu public en 2018.
Le rapport complet du comité est accessible au public en ligne. Parmi les faits saillants, mentionnons :

veiller à ce que le curriculum soit exempt de la prescription d’approches pédagogiques, telles que les mathématiques par la découverte
aborder la littératie financière, la préparation au travail, le bienêtre et l’établissement d’objectifs afin d’améliorer les aptitudes des élèves à la vie quotidienne
mettre en œuvre des outils d’évaluation normalisés pour évaluer la littératie et la numératie de la 1re à la 5e année
aligner l’ébauche du curriculum M à 4 de 2018 sur la nouvelle vision pour l’apprentissage des élèves
offrir aux élèves des occasions d’apprentissage intégrées au travail
veiller à ce que les apprentissages des Premières Nations, des Métis et des Inuits continuent d’être pris en compte dans notre curriculum


« Au nom de tous les membres du comité, je suis ravi d’avoir fait partie du processus de révision du curriculum de l’Alberta. Nous reconnaissons que tous nos élèves ont besoin d’une éducation qui assure leur réussite dans un environnement en rapide mutation économique, sociale et mondiale. Nous comptons sur nos jeunes gens pour aider à créer une province où tous les Albertains peuvent s’épanouir. Alors que certains éléments de l’ébauche du curriculum M à 12 sont à retenir, il y a matière à amélioration. Le comité consultatif sur le curriculum a présenté des recommandations visant à faire en sorte que les élèves ont les connaissances, les habiletés et les compétences essentielles pour avoir la meilleure vie possible au-delà du secondaire. »
Angus McBeath, président, comité consultatif sur le curriculum


« Nous avons abordé notre mandat avec une question essentielle en tête : quelles sont les connaissances et les habiletés clés que doivent posséder les élèves à la fin du secondaire? Qu’il s’agisse de la littératie financière ou de veiller à ce que le curriculum soit exempt de la prescription d’approches pédagogiques, nous croyons que ces recommandations aideront le gouvernement à aller de l’avant avec la modernisation du système d’éducation en Alberta. »
Jen Panteluk, vice-présidente, comité consultatif sur le curriculum

Les conseils dans le rapport du comité consultatif sur le curriculum sont distincts du sondage, qui porte sur l’ébauche de la vision pour l’apprentissage des élèves. Les recommandations du comité seront prises en compte avec les commentaires des Albertains sur l’ébauche de la vision et guideront les prochaines étapes de la mise à jour du curriculum.

Minister of Health Tyler Shandro, along with Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO of Alberta Health Services, meets with representatives from ethnic media.

Alberta Health Services has added information to its website in the eight languages most commonly requested for medical translation and interpretation in Alberta. 

“The provincial health system should be accessible to all Albertans, no matter their first language, ethnicity or background. Providing translated information online reflects the diversity of Albertans and helps meet the needs of patients and families. I am pleased to see this new content added to the AHS website.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health

Minister Shandro has met with reporters and editors at many ethnic media outlets to highlight this new information.

“Our government is prioritizing access to translation and interpretation services as a part of our focus on multiculturalism and inclusion. This step will remove barriers in the health-care system for many Albertans. Whether it is a routine check-up or an emergency situation, accessing medical care while navigating a language barrier can add to an already stressful situation. Our government is working to alleviate stress by increasing accessibility so all Albertans can use these essential services.”
Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women


“AHS is here to help Albertans of all cultures and ethnicities get the care they need, when they need it. Our organization embraces diversity and inclusion, and this project expands our ongoing efforts to ensure all Albertans know how to access health services and feel welcome doing so.”

how to access services in languages other than English across the health system

AHS’ Interpretation and Translation Services program ensures that any AHS patient requiring interpretation services is connected, in real time, to supports available 24-7. The program also ensures that Albertans who seek care in family physician offices, pharmacies and other non-AHS settings can access these supports, where and when they need them. 
This language initiative is a long-term project. AHS is committed to adding to these pages, adding further languages and providing content that addresses barriers for individuals who are deaf.

Cette initiative permettra d'éliminer les obstacles auxquels font face de nombreux Albertains et Albertaines dans le système de soins de santé de la province. Les barrières linguistiques peuvent ajouter à une situation déjà stressante lorsqu’il est question d’accéder à des soins médicaux, qu’il s’agisse d’un examen de routine ou d’une situation d'urgence. Notre gouvernement s'efforce de réduire ce stress en augmentant l'accessibilité de tous et de toutes à ces services essentiels. »
Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine


« AHS est là pour aider les Albertains et les Albertaines de toutes les cultures et de toutes les ethnies à obtenir les soins dont ils ont besoin, quand ils en ont besoin. Notre organisme appuie la diversité et l'inclusion, et ce projet élargit nos efforts permanents qui visent à s’assurer que toute la population sait comment accéder aux services de santé et qu’elle se sent à l’aise de le faire. »

Le programme de services d’interprétation et de traduction d’AHS garantit que tous les patients d’AHS qui ont besoin de services d'interprétation se voient offrir des mesures d’appui en temps réel, 24 heures sur 24. Le programme veille également à ce que les Albertains et les Albertaines qui se font soigner dans les cabinets de médecins de famille, les pharmacies et d'autres établissements qui ne sont pas sous la responsabilité d’AHS puissent accéder à ces soins, où et quand ils en ont besoin.

“Every year since 2011, the Bell Let’s Talk campaign has challenged us all to change the conversation surrounding mental health issues and those who live with them.
“Few things in life are as universally relatable as mental illness – one in five of us will face it at some point – and yet few things are harder to talk about. Shame begets stigma, and stigma begets silence. So this quiet crisis continues, claiming lives and devastating families.
“Help is waiting and recovery is on the horizon. Our mental health and addictions strategy means those in need have a hopeful path forward – a path that often begins with three simple words: ‘Can we talk?’ ”
“My government colleagues and I can strategize, fund supports and push for change – and we’re doing just that. But with your help, we can do much more than that. We can change the conversation. We can end the stigma. We can contribute to a culture where every person in our province knows they never have to be ashamed or suffer in silence.
“Let’s move mental health forward in Alberta. Let’s talk.”

Although he was apprehended in Saskatchewan, initial contact between the individual and police occurred near Cold Lake, and led to a police pursuit that ended in a field in Saskatchewan. The majority of involved officers were Alberta RCMP officers. For these reasons, the decision was made to involve ASIRT. While uncommon, this approach has occurred in other cases where the triggering events occurred in Alberta but crossed into another province.
ASIRT’s investigation was comprehensive and thorough, and followed current investigative protocols. All relevant witnesses were interviewed. The involved officers, though not legally required to do so, provided voluntary statements regarding their involvement in the matter. The RCMP vehicles were equipped with Watchguard video systems, which captured a portion of the man’s interaction with officers and the police service dog as the man was placed in handcuffs.
On Oct. 1, 2018, RCMP received information that the 23-year-old man and another man had taken a black Chevrolet Cruze without consent and were in possession of a loaded handgun and a rifle.
Both the 23-year-old man and the other identified man were known to police. The 23-year-old man was known to carry firearms and had a criminal record for offences involving the illegal possession and use of firearms, robbery, criminal flight from police, and resisting arrest. In addition to the current complaint, the man was being sought for several robberies using firearms and additional criminal offences. He had been involved in a previous incident during which he was believed to have fired upon police. The other man had a similar criminal background.
The 23-year-old man was located driving the vehicle in the area of Range Road 421 and Highway 55, with a woman in the passenger seat. It appeared that the man became aware of the police presence, as he began driving in the wrong lane and into oncoming traffic before the officer activated his emergency equipment. As a result of the man’s behaviour, the officer activated his emergency lights and siren, but the man failed to stop the vehicle. A significant pursuit ensued.
It is not necessary to detail the pursuit for the purposes of our investigation, other than to say that the man’s driving objectively endangered public safety, the safety of the passenger in his vehicle, and the involved police officers. The pursuit ended several kilometres east of Pierceland, Sask., north of Highway 55, when the man’s vehicle began overheating and he abruptly drove off the roadway into a field. As the vehicle came to a stop, the man exited and attempted to flee on foot.
The man’s girlfriend, who was in the passenger seat, was interviewed. She advised that when they stopped the vehicle, she told the man not to resist police but that he exited the vehicle and attempted to flee on foot. She said that it was difficult for her see what was happening with the man as she was dealing with police herself, who approached her while she remained seated in the vehicle, telling her not to move.
As the man fled, one of the officers, a dog handler accompanied by a police service dog, exited a police vehicle and ordered him to stop, informing him that he was under arrest. The involved officers all describe the situation as dynamic, heightened by the belief that the man might be armed with a firearm. When the man failed to stop, the officer gave the police service dog the command to apprehend him.
As the dog caught up with him, the man turned and took a swing at the police dog. The dog latched onto the man’s right midsection. The man fought with the police dog, trying to pry the dog’s mouth open, grabbing and pulling on the dog’s ears or scruff as the dog whined but continued to bite. At one point, the man appeared to be attempting to put the dog in a headlock. The dog handler and another officer approached to place the man in handcuffs.
The next seconds were somewhat of a melee, as the police dog, the man, and the two officers engaged in a struggle as the officers tried unsuccessfully to gain control of the man’s hands, unsure whether he had a gun on his person. Multiple strikes to the head and a knee strike to the man’s torso were used by the two involved officers.
The Watchguard video recording system in a police vehicle arriving on scene captured the final seconds before the man was handcuffed. In the video, the man appears to struggle with both the officers and the dog. The dog can be seen biting and actively pulling on the man. As the dog handler grabs the police dog, the other officer manages to get the man on his stomach and handcuff his hands behind his back.
After the man was successfully handcuffed, the police dog remained latched on to the man. The dog handler stood over the dog and attempted, unsuccessfully, to get it to release its grip. For approximately 50 seconds, the police dog continued to bite the man while the handler attempted to pull him off, at one point attaching a lead. The dog finally released its grip on the man and was pulled off, the handler holding the clearly agitated dog with two hands.
The man was searched for weapons, but none were found. The man had sustained serious dog bites, including wounds to his abdominal area deep enough to expose tissue. The officers called for an ambulance, and attempted to make the affected person as comfortable as possible, providing him with a blanket and encouraging him to remain as still as possible to prevent worsening the abdominal wounds. After the man arrived at the hospital, doctors noted very serious dog bite injuries to his right abdominal wall and lumbar region, in addition to his right gluteal region. The man had also sustained a fracture of the right mandible. The injuries were serious enough to require multiple surgeries.
Police later received information that the man had, in fact, disposed of a firearm in the field. On Oct. 28, 2018, a loaded Tokarev TT Pistol containing three rounds was found in the field near the location where the vehicle was abandoned. While it is likely that the man or his passenger had possession of this firearm on Oct. 1, 2018, for the purposes of this assessment it is not necessary to resolve this issue. Even with the absence of the recovered firearm, there was ample information at the time to provide a reasonable belief that the affected person might be in possession of a firearm, and that he presented a heightened risk to the public and police.
As the injuries were the result of police conduct, it is necessary to turn to the question as to whether the involved officers acted lawfully.
A police officer is entitled in law to use force in the lawful execution of his duties provided he uses no more force than is reasonably necessary to carry out his lawful purpose. While police may have to resort to the use of force in the course of their duties, the allowable degree of force remains constrained by principles of proportionality, necessity and reasonableness.
The involved officers were clearly lawfully placed and acting in the lawful execution of their duties as police officers. There were reasonable grounds to believe that the man had committed a number of different serious criminal offences. They had the authority in law to arrest the man. While it is not possible to determine, with certainty, which officer fractured the man’s jaw, it is not necessary to resolve this issue if both officers were acting lawfully. The issue is whether the force used, involving both the deployment and control of the police service dog, and the use of head strikes, was necessary and reasonable.
Whether a person involved in an encounter with police has a criminal history can be relevant if officers are, firstly, aware of the person’s background at the time they are dealing with that person, and, secondly, that background has some relevance, objectively, to the situation unfolding and what risks one might subjectively and objectively perceive.
In this particular case, officers were faced with what would, both subjectively and objectively, be a potentially high-risk arrest. The man was known to police and had a criminal history for violence involving the use of firearms. He was the subject of a Criminal Code firearms prohibition. He was known to go to significant lengths to try and evade apprehension, including engaging in criminal flight, and had previously fired on police. He was wanted for a variety of offences, including a number of robberies involving the use of a firearm. In this case, he was reportedly in possession of a vehicle that had been taken without consent, had earlier been in the company of another known violent offender, and was believed to be in possible possession of a handgun, with access to a rifle that was in the trunk of the vehicle. Upon encountering police, he engaged in criminal flight and placed both the public and police at risk.
Given the above, police were well-advised to consider the man a potential threat to public and police safety. Equally important, it was both prudent and reasonable to believe that the affected person might be in possession of a firearm and that he was more than capable of using it.
Duty and the protection of the public required the apprehension of the man. Following his criminal flight, the man stopped only because the vehicle had overheated. When he fled on foot, it was impossible for the officers to know with any certainty whether he had a handgun in his possession, and it was reasonable to err on the side of caution. In these circumstances, it was reasonable for the sake of officer safety to deploy the police service dog to apprehend the man when he failed to respond to directions to stop.
Given the risk presented by the man, his non-compliance with commands, and his attempted flight on foot, the use of force was necessary. Furthermore, the use of intermediate levels of force, including the police service dog and the punches/strikes used by both officers to gain control and custody of the man, were both proportionate to the circumstances and reasonable.
The only potential issue would relate to the police dog’s continued bite even after the man had been placed in handcuffs. For an additional approximately 50 seconds, the dog refused to release the man and continued biting and pulling on the man while his handler attempted to gain control. Having been handcuffed, the need for the police dog’s engagement was no longer necessary.
In many respects, a police service dog is a use of force tool, not unlike an officer’s service pistol, baton, or a conducted energy weapon. That said, unlike the other tools, a police service dog is not an inanimate object. It is a sentient being with its own instincts. It is the subject of significant training and control by a handler but can act on instinct. One can reasonably expect that the police dog’s response would be slightly different when, as in this case, the man actively fought the dog, as opposed to circumstances where a person surrenders following contact with the dog. It is for this reason that intensive training is undertaken to attempt to ensure that, even in the most heightened situation, the police service dog remains capable of being controlled by its handler.
It must also be remembered that the use of police service dogs constitute an intermediate use of force that allow officers to more safely address high-risk situations, allowing them to deploy the dog where a subject is armed or may be armed with a weapon, particularly a firearm. If it is possible to handle such a situation without escalating the matter to its highest, and most potentially dangerous, response, that is a positive. There have been cases where officers have been dealing with a person believed to have a firearm that have resulted in the use of lethal force. As serious as the resulting injuries were in this case, the use of the police service dog was a much better available alternative to the potential use of a service pistol.
Examining the officer’s conduct involving the use of the police dog, one should be cautious about approaching a continuing use of force by breaking events into isolated portions as the entire event is a continuing transaction and there should be some recognition of this fact, as well as the exigencies of the moment. The standard for assessment of the officer’s control of the police dog is not perfection. In this case, the officer’s attempt to get the police dog to disengage was hampered by the dog’s heightened agitation. There was no evidence to suggest that the officer was acting in bad faith in his attempts to get the dog to disengage, or that he was motivated by malicious intent. One should also remain mindful that an officer “cannot be expected to measure the force used with exactitude”. This seems even more apropos when examining the conduct of an officer and his police service dog. In all of the circumstances, while the officer should continually work to improve his ability to control his police dog and should, if faced with a similar situation in the future, better recognize and reflect the urgency in gaining that control, the use of the police service dog did not, at any point during this encounter, amount to an unreasonable or excessive use of force.
It is truly unfortunate that the man, as a result of his contact with the two officers and the police service dog, sustained very serious injuries. While the consequences were terrible, that does not change the lawfulness of the officers’ actions. Upon review of the completed investigation, it is executive director Susan Hughson’s opinion that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the officers committed a Criminal Code offence. There being no grounds to believe that an offence was committed by any police officer, no charges will be laid.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

“We are extremely concerned by the federal government’s recent decision to terminate the funding agreement for First Nations students attending Exshaw School without a plan to work with these students, their families, or the Canadian Rockies School Division. This short-sighted decision has forced Canadian Rockies School Division to vote in favour of repurposing the school.
“Exshaw School has been supported by federal funding since 1973. Roughly 99 per cent of the students attending the school are from Stoney Nakoda First Nation.
“In December, we wrote to Marc Miller, federal Minister of Indigenous Services, expressing our concern about the decision and urged him to reconsider this funding decision. To date, our requests have gone unanswered.
“This decision by the federal government is not an effective or appropriate way to support the education needs of First Nations students. It will eliminate this important educational choice for a significant number of First Nations families, which may in turn have a detrimental impact on the students attending the school.
“The federal government must step up and support Exshaw School. We urge Minister Miller to provide adequate funding, and to immediately begin working with the Canadian Rockies School Division and the Stoney Education Authority – as well as affected parents and families – to ensure Exshaw School can remain open and continue to provide high-quality education to First Nations students.”

Minister Nixon learning how to spawn trout at the Raven Creek Brood Trout Station.

The province will replace the Raven Creek Brood Trout Station and refurbish Sam Livingston Fish Hatchery and Allison Creek Brood Trout Station. Critical operating systems at each facility were at or beyond their expected service life.
The new Raven Creek facility will be larger to support increased stocking numbers and will include dedicated space for additional species, such as tiger trout and Arctic grayling.
Alberta’s fisheries management system aims to make our fisheries strong, healthy, vibrant and sustainable for future generations. About 300,000 anglers fish Alberta’s lakes and rivers every year, and for every dollar invested in the province’s fisheries, $20 is generated for the economy. Overall, sport fishing contributes more than $600 million annually to Alberta’s economy. The province’s fisheries also support jobs for Albertans – from tour guides, to outfitters and equipment rentals, to jobs in the tourism and service sector that support the meals, lodging and transportation required for fishing trips.

“Fishing is an important part of Alberta’s cultural fabric and supports countless jobs across the province. Replacing and upgrading fish hatcheries enables us to increase our stocking programs, while ensuring these facilities operate more efficiently and are better protected against disease. The result will be a fishery that is strong, healthy, vibrant and sustainable for generations to come.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks


“The investment announced today is great news for Alberta’s anglers, as it provides the basis for increased recreational fishing activities across the province and lays the groundwork for a wide range of fisheries enhancement possibilities in the future.”
Todd Zimmerling, president and CEO, Alberta Conservation Association

Upgrades to Sam Livingston Fish Hatchery and the Allison Creek Brood Trout Station are underway. Fish production at all three facilities will be optimized through modernized operating systems, improved water quality and stronger biosecurity, and energy and water consumption will be reduced.
Funding for all three projects totals $43 million, with $16 million allocated in previous budgets.
The Raven Creek Brood Trout Station has been in operation since the 1930s and is one of Alberta’s oldest operating hatcheries. The current infrastructure was constructed primarily in the 1970s, with few modifications. The arrangement and space at the facility is no longer adequate for its role in the province’s stocking program, and the aging and deteriorating infrastructure presents an increased risk of exposure to waterborne fish disease.
Sam Livingston Fish Hatchery and Allison Creek Brood Trout Station were constructed in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Water treatment and filtration systems at both facilities were at the end of their service life.
The Sam Livingston Fish Hatchery plays an important role as part of Bow Habitat Station’s public education initiatives, allowing Albertans to get an up-close look at how trout are raised, and how the fish stocking program supports sustainable fishing opportunities in the province.
Quick facts

$26 million is budgeted for the Raven Creek Brood Trout Station, located near Caroline. Construction is expected to begin in the summer of 2021.
$12.6 million worth of upgrades to Sam Livingston Fish Hatchery, located in Calgary, are substantially complete. The facility is expected to be running at full capacity later this winter.
Improvements totaling more than $4 million are underway for Allison Creek Brood Trout Station, located in Crowsnest Pass. Upgrades are expected to be complete this summer.
The provincial stocking program stocks an average of 2.1 million trout per year into almost 240 water bodies throughout Alberta.

ASIRT’s investigation was comprehensive and thorough, and conducted using current investigative protocols. ASIRT interviewed all relevant police and civilian witnesses, examined the scene, ensured it was properly photographed, contained and forensically examined, seized relevant exhibits, and attended the autopsy. While the video footage of the incident was extremely limited, ASIRT took possession of the available video for analysis. While under no obligation to do so, the three officers who discharged their firearms provided a statement to ASIRT investigators and provided access to their notes and reports.
At the time of the incident, the 30-year-old man was the subject of an Edmonton Police Service investigation into trafficking of methamphetamine. On Sept. 8, 2017, EPS officers were granted a search warrant for a residence associated to the man and investigators developed a plan for the man’s arrest and the execution of the warrant. In addition to having reasonable grounds to believe that the man was engaged in the trafficking of a controlled substance (methamphetamine), officers had received information indicating that the man was in possession of firearms. Given the gravity of the offences, the information regarding the man being armed, and the man’s previous criminal history, the proposed execution of the search warrant was properly deemed a high-risk situation. A decision was made to try to arrest the man while he was either on foot or in his vehicle. In support of this plan, surveillance was established to attempt to locate him. Attempts to locate him that day were unsuccessful.
On Sept. 9, 2017, surveillance was re-established, and the EPS tactical section was engaged to assist the operation. Members of the tactical section were provided with a package detailing all relevant information, including the grounds for arrest, the man’s criminal history, the information detailing his possession of firearms, and the fact that the man had previously engaged in criminal flight from police on an unrelated investigation. Criminal flight from police is always considered high-risk.
At approximately 8 p.m., the man was seen entering and driving a white Mercedes-Benz sedan, in the company of two young women. He was seen carrying a black, satchel-style bag consistent with where police had been told he might be carrying a firearm. Unmarked police vehicles followed the man to the Westmount Mall parking lot on the corner of Groat Road and 111th Avenue. The man backed the Mercedes into a parking stall on the west side of Groat Road, between a McDonald’s restaurant and a Boston Pizza restaurant. The man was seated in the driver’s seat, with one of the women seated in the front passenger seat and the second young woman in the back seat on the passenger side.
Having satisfied themselves that there were no persons in the immediate vicinity, the decision was made that it would be better to attempt to apprehend the man at this location before he had an opportunity to engage in a criminal flight. Tactical officers boxed in the Mercedes, with a tactical vehicle parking directly behind the Mercedes and another parking directly in front. A third tactical vehicle, a van, parked immediately beside the Mercedes, on the passenger side. While all three of these vehicles were unmarked, there is significant evidence that the vehicles were readily identifiable as police vehicles. Both civilian and police witnesses indicated that the emergency lights on the vehicles were activated. Video evidence seized from a nearby civilian witness similarly confirmed that the vehicles were equipped with emergency lights that were activated during the encounter.
Tactical section officers exited their vehicles. Two diversionary devices (commonly referred to as “flash bangs,” used to temporarily disorient subjects) were deployed to distract the occupants of the Mercedes. Officers identified themselves as police and ordered all occupants to show their hands and to slowly exit the vehicle. The occupants of the vehicle, including the man, were initially compliant with the command to show their hands, holding them up, but none of the occupants attempted to comply with the command to slowly exit the vehicle. This led to a brief standoff, estimated as lasting for approximately 20 seconds. 
This impasse ended when the man was seen shaking his head before he dropped his hands and placed the Mercedes in reverse, ramming the police truck at the rear of the Mercedes. The Mercedes then accelerated forward and rammed the police vehicle in front, with sufficient force that the driver’s side airbag went off. At this point, an officer deployed two canisters of CS gas into the Mercedes through the open passenger-side window. As the occupants of the Mercedes dealt with the effects of the CS gas, the police vehicles repositioned and eliminated the distance between them and the Mercedes, effectively pinning the vehicle again.
One officer gave verbal commands for the two young women to exit the vehicle, and another officer began to remove the female passenger from the front seat. At this point, the man accessed the black satchel-style bag around his neck and retrieved a handgun. As an officer shouted, “Don’t do it!” several times, another officer deployed an ARWEN baton round that struck the man but failed to disarm him. An ARWEN launcher is intended to be a less-than-lethal option for police to try to disarm and/or incapacitate armed subjects. It launches a baton round that, unlike a bullet, is intended to impact but not penetrate. The man raised his handgun and pointed it directly toward one of the nearest officers, resulting in that officer and two others discharging their firearms.
During this time, the evidence is unequivocal that the man fired two rounds from his handgun, from the inside of the vehicle through the dash of the Mercedes. As it appeared that the man again pointed his handgun at an officer, one of the officers fired what would be a lethal shot. Following this shot, the man was observed to slump over in the vehicle.
Tactical section members were accompanied by a paramedic in the role of Tactical Emergency Medical Support (TEMS). The role of the TEMS paramedic is to provide rapid emergency medical care to any party injured in the course of a tactical operation. Officers removed the man from the vehicle. He was examined by the paramedic but it was determined that the man was deceased.
The two young women that had been removed from the vehicle, both 18 years of age, were uninjured during the event.
The gun the man had been carrying, a black 9-mm handgun, was recovered from the front floor of the Mercedes.
 
The firearm was cocked, with one live round in the chamber, and another live round remaining in the magazine. Two spent 9-mm shell casings were recovered that matched the two live rounds that remained inside the firearm. A forensic examination of the vehicle traced the path of two bullets fired by the man forward from the area of the driver’s seat of the Mercedes in the direction of the officers.
An autopsy conducted Sept. 13, 2017, determined the cause of death to be multiple gunshot wounds. A toxicology examination confirmed the presence of methamphetamine in the man’s body at the time of his death. The black satchel-style bag was found to contain a significant quantity of methamphetamine, a scale, and a second magazine for the firearm.
Under the Criminal Code, police officers are granted certain powers and authorities to facilitate the performance of what can be a challenging job. Under the Criminal Code, a police officer is authorized to use as much force as is reasonably necessary in administration or enforcement of the law. This can, in limited circumstances, include force that is intended or likely to cause grievous bodily harm or death. Resort to lethal force is only authorized in circumstances when an officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of anyone under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm. Further, under the Criminal Code any person, including a police officer, is entitled to the use of reasonable force in defence of themselves or another person.
For a police officer’s use of force to be not only authorized but protected, the officer must be acting in the lawful execution of his or her duties -- often referred to as lawful placement. In this particular case, all officers were on duty and actively engaged in the lawful execution of their duties. It was readily apparent that they were police. At the time, the officers had both the grounds and the lawful authority to arrest the man. The evidence demonstrated that the information possessed by police led to the arrest of the man being properly characterized as high-risk.
Any assessment of the reasonableness of force used requires consideration of a number of different factors, including the use or threatened use of a weapon, the imminence of the threat, other options available, and the nature of the force or threat of force itself. This case involved the highest risk for police: the possession and use of a loaded firearm that had the capacity to kill. In the face of overwhelming odds, when it should have been clear to the man that he would be taken into custody and that surrender was the only viable option, the man pulled and pointed a loaded gun at police. Indeed, he went further and actually fired at police. Officers used many techniques and tools to attempt to apprehend the man without lethal force, including the flash bangs, CS gas, and an ARWEN launcher, only resorting to lethal force when the man escalated the situation by producing his firearm. At that point, if not before, the man’s conduct clearly presented a risk of grievous bodily harm or death to the officers.
While initially compliant with verbal commands, the situation shifted dramatically when the man twice put the vehicle into motion in an attempt to escape. The situation further escalated when, despite repeated verbal commands, the man drew a firearm from his bag and raised it in the direction of officers. This risk was not merely theoretical, as evidenced by the fact that the man discharged two rounds in the direction of a police officer, presenting a substantial and immediate threat to his life.
In the circumstances, the decision by the three officers to resort to lethal force, while tragic, was justified.
Having reviewed the evidence and investigation in its entirety, it is the opinion of executive director Susan Hughson, QC, that the evidence does not provide reasonable grounds to believe that any officers committed any offences. The officers were legally entitled to arrest the man, and had taken steps to create a situation where it should have been evident that the only reasonable option was surrender. The man’s actions, however, placed officers in a situation where they were very clearly at risk of death or grievous bodily harm. In these circumstances, the use of lethal force was not only reasonable but necessary. There being no reasonable grounds to believe that an offence was committed by a police officer, no charges will be laid.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

Premier Jason Kenney and Indigenous Relations Minister Rick Wilson join the first Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation Board of Directors meeting.


“This will be a game-changer for Indigenous communities seeking to be owners of resource projects. It will also help all Albertans to get resource projects done. With the board now in place, the AIOC can now fulfil its mandate to enfranchise Indigenous communities in Alberta, to lift their people from poverty to prosperity by becoming partners in the energy projects that have created so much wealth for our province.”
Jason Kenney, Premier

With the board of directors now in place, the corporation can begin allocating up to $1 billion in investment support, such as loan guarantees, to qualified First Nations seeking to take an equity position in major resource projects. While the board sets up criteria to backup projects, the interim CEO, Matthew Machielse, has been meeting with Indigenous, industry and financial leaders, and learning about potential projects that may have lasting benefits for Indigenous communities.

“The Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation will benefit Indigenous Peoples and all Albertans. Indigenous Peoples were the first entrepreneurs in this country and are open to doing business. I would like to thank the board for giving their time and extensive expertise to help the First Nations and Métis people of Alberta become true partners in prosperity.”
Rick Wilson, Minister of Indigenous Relations

The board of this first-of-its-kind Crown corporation in Canada will be setting the AIOC’s strategic direction, overseeing management of the AIOC’s business and making investment support decisions that help to flow money back into Indigenous communities.
Board members include:

Cody Church, chair 
Stephen Buffalo, vice-chair
Heather Barnhouse
Gary Bosgoed
Strater Crowfoot
Aroon Sequeira
Peter Williams
Donavon Young


“Our goal as board members is to have Indigenous communities acquire meaningful economic participation that leads to social benefits from the sustainable development of our natural resources. The AIOC will achieve this by enabling significant Indigenous equity participation in commercially viable projects.”
Cody Church, board chair, AIOC

Quick facts

The AIOC will support Indigenous communities’ investment in natural resource projects and related infrastructure in the energy (which includes oil and gas, renewable energy and coal), mining and forestry industries.
Project proposals require a minimum Indigenous investment of $20 million. Indigenous communities can form coalitions to make that contribution.
Projects inside Alberta and in other provinces are eligible for support. Projects outside the province must benefit Alberta’s natural resource sector to be eligible.
Indigenous groups outside of Alberta are eligible by partnering with one or more Alberta Indigenous community that has at least 25 per cent of the total combined Indigenous ownership of the project.

“On this day 75 years ago, soldiers liberated more than 7,000 prisoners from the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi concentration and death camp. From 1940 to 1945, Auschwitz was the largest of four camps operated by the Nazi regime in Poland for the sole purpose of murdering the Jewish peoples of Europe, and other enemies of the Third Reich.
“During the Second World War, the Nazi regime targeted and brutally murdered more than six million Jews because of their faith and race.
“In remembering the Holocaust and paying tribute to millions of victims, we affirm our commitment to fight Holocaust denial, the evils of anti-Semitism and genocide. It is our responsibility to continue to educate future generations about the effects of prejudice and hatred.
“As Albertans, we know there is no room anti-Semitism. We are a province of welcoming, understanding and hard-working people. Today, we stand with survivors, their families and friends to mourn, acknowledge this unfathomable crime, and to educate future generations about the Shoah.""

“This is a time for sweeping out the ill fortune accumulated during the previous year to make room for new luck and prosperity. Often, those who celebrate will gather with family to share meals and exchange gifts.
“As Albertans, traditions of our various cultural heritages sustain the diversity that makes this province great and help foster a sense of belonging.
“May all who celebrate the Lunar New Year find a way to return home for the reunion dinner, and may the Year of the Rat be auspicious for Alberta.”

A new code of practice for power lines impacting wetlands, which came into effect Dec. 23, maintains environmental protections and applies a more appropriate level of oversight for low-risk construction activities. This change will allow electricity providers to carry out important work on power lines without costly delays.

“Our government continues to take action on red tape reduction to make Alberta one of the freest and fastest-moving economies in the world. This code of practice supports Alberta’s electricity providers by reducing the administrative burden and project delay costs, while ensuring enforceable standards and conditions remain in place to protect our province’s wetlands.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks


“Albertans expect us to ensure that we’re protecting the environment while we deliver reliable and affordable energy to their homes, farms and businesses. By streamlining this process, the code of practice for power lines impacting wetlands provides utilities with clarity on our environmental requirements and allows all of us to complete critical power line work in a shorter time frame.”
Ed Rihn, senior vice-president, AltaLink


“Ducks Unlimited Canada has a proud history of working collaboratively with numerous partners, including industry and government, in the development of pragmatic conservation solutions for working landscapes. DUC supports innovative tools like codes of practice that, when applied appropriately, achieve the goals of the Alberta Wetland Policy while maintaining Alberta’s economic prosperity.”
Ron Maher, manager of Provincial Operations, Ducks Unlimited Canada

Winter is the preferred construction season for Alberta’s electricity providers because they can minimize disturbance with wildlife and avoid difficult construction conditions due to wet or soft ground and expensive mitigation techniques.
The code of practice for power lines impacting wetlands was developed with input from affected operators and Ducks Unlimited Canada.
Red Tape Reduction Awareness Week
Alberta has declared Jan. 20-24 Red Tape Reduction Awareness Week. This coincides with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’s own Red Tape Awareness Week, which aims to raise awareness of the costs of regulatory burdens to businesses across Canada. This year, the CFIB gave Alberta B-minus for its efforts to cut red tape, the highest grade the province has ever achieved.
Quick facts
Code of practice:

A code of practice regulates activities under the Water Act that would normally require an approval.
The code sets out the standards and conditions that must be met to ensure the activity minimizes the disturbance and impact on the environment.
The person or company planning to undertake an activity under the code provides notice along with their activity plans to Environment and Parks, rather than submitting an application and waiting for approval.
Enforcement of activities conducted under the code follows the same general process used for activities that require an approval.

Red tape reduction:

To date, CutRedTape.Alberta.ca has received more than 4,500 submissions.
Ministries are currently taking inventory and analyzing the regulatory burden imposed on Albertans and businesses, modernizing regulation requirements, processes, forms and policies, and eliminating those that are unnecessary.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business estimates that in 2017, the cost for businesses in Alberta to comply with regulations was about $4.4 billion.

The Government of Alberta’s new electronic loan process means students won’t have to fill out paper agreements and take them to a Canada Post office to be validated, signed and mailed in for processing. It will also save about $400,000 in tax dollars each year.

“Moving to an entirely online application for student loans is long overdue. Students will no longer need to complete paper forms and, furthermore, they will now be able to use e-signatures. This new process will save students time and will speed up the approval process, saving taxpayer dollars and reducing red tape for our students, so they can focus on their studies. Eliminating red tape for our students is an important priority for me and our government.”
Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education

The new e-consent Alberta student loans applications and agreements will be available through the Advanced Education Student Aid website beginning Feb. 7. Students who do not have access to computers will still be able to submit paper agreements.

“Alberta Students Executive Council supports the move to a modern advanced education system. The shift to an online application process will increase access and reduce the administrative burden placed on students as they apply for Alberta student loans.”
 Emmanauel Barker, director of Government Relations and Advocacy, Alberta Students Executive Council


“By replacing the paper-based financial assistance agreement with the digital consent, Alberta Advanced Education is enhancing student experiences, changing the process to something that is more familiar to students. This change will make it easier for students as everything will be done through their online portal – no need to go to a post office or mail anything in. More importantly, the process should be faster and, thus, students will receive the financial support they need in a timely fashion.”

Minister Madu tours Western Archrib with (L-R) Paul Whittaker, Scott Fash of BILD, Dale Beesley, Municipal Affairs, and Andre Lema, of Western Archrib.

Municipal Affairs Minister Kaycee Madu announced the change Friday, as part of Red Tape Reduction Awareness Week.
While other jurisdictions in Canada, like British Columbia, currently allow for 12-storey wood construction, Alberta will become the first province in Canada to allow the practice provincewide.

“Not only will this decision support the forestry industry and land developers, it will provide affordability to homebuyers, bolster employment, and give Alberta a competitive advantage. We made this change knowing that mass timber products are safe and that these buildings will meet all necessary standards.”

Current Alberta and national building codes allow wood-building construction for up to six storeys, but the next edition of the National Building Code – anticipated for publication at the end of 2020 – will allow for the use of tall wood construction with fire-resistant material for up to 12 storeys.
Alberta will issue a notice – based on technical provisions developed for the next edition of the National Building Code – to allow early use of tall wood or mass timber construction for up to 12 storeys using fire-resistant material in time for the upcoming construction season.

“We commend the Government of Alberta for advancing the use of wood-building construction of up to 12 storeys with this provincewide variance. By building with products that are made locally, we are supporting thousands of jobs in small communities and large cities throughout the province. From people working in sawmills, to value-add facilities, to jobs in construction and transportation, everyone benefits from this change. Moreover, because wood is fully renewable and has a low carbon footprint, our environment benefits, too.”
Paul Whittaker, president, Alberta Forest Products Association 

New technology makes taller wood construction feasible
Advancements in fire-protection and wood-product technology are allowing for the construction of taller wood buildings without compromising safety.
The building codes will require tall wood buildings to be built as encapsulated mass timber construction, where the solid or engineered wood has been surrounded by fire-resistive material. Buildings of mass timber construction will also be fully sprinklered.

“BILD Alberta is excited to see the Government of Alberta take steps to modernize construction, reduce red tape and address environmental needs by allowing innovative techniques to deliver the homes and buildings people need. This provides our industry and member companies with more options in meeting the housing affordability needs of Albertans.”
Patrick Shaver, chair, BILD Alberta Chair, and president of Avillia Developments

Quick facts

Wood buildings taller than six storeys have been built in Vancouver (University of British Columbia’s 18-storey Brock Commons), Europe, the United States, and other jurisdictions around the world.
Mass or laminated timber has excellent durability and seismic, fire, and acoustic safety performance.
The encapsulated mass-timber construction component of the 2020 National Building Code has already been reviewed by the National Building Code committees and fire-safety specialists, structural engineers, architects, scientists, and builders.

Economic impact of tall wood buildings

Potential to create about 60 jobs per construction site and up to 400 jobs per new sawmill and production sites.
A growth in demand for lumber, for example, 100-million board feet, about $40-million worth of lumber, is the equivalent to about two mills the size of Boucher Bros Lumber.

Red Tape Reduction Awareness Week
Alberta has declared Jan. 20-24 Red Tape Reduction Awareness Week. This coincides with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’s own Red Tape Awareness Week, which aims to raise awareness of the costs of regulatory burdens to businesses across Canada. This year, the CFIB gave Alberta B-minus for its efforts to cut red tape, the highest grade the province has ever achieved.
Quick facts

To date, CutRedTape.Alberta.ca has received more than 4,500 submissions.
Ministries are currently taking inventory and analyzing the regulatory burden imposed on Albertans and businesses, modernizing regulation requirements, processes, forms and policies, and eliminating those that are unnecessary.
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business estimates that in 2017, the cost for businesses in Alberta to comply with regulations was about $4.4 billion.

Under the Alberta Food Regulation, bed-and-breakfast operators were only allowed to serve breakfast, while other small lodging businesses were required to invest in a commercial kitchen if they wanted to serve lunch or supper.
Effective Feb.1, bed-and-breakfasts will now be able serve their guests meals at any time of day. Guest ranches and other similar small businesses will be able to serve meals under the bed-and-breakfast requirements, which are designed to be practical for home-based businesses.

“This is good for businesses, good for visitors to our province and good for Albertans. These changes will create additional revenue streams for small businesses and provide more dining options for visitors enjoying this province’s amazing bed-and-breakfasts.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction 


“The modernization of Alberta’s policy and regulatory framework is key to supporting the growth of Alberta’s visitor economy and to helping tourism businesses be more responsive to the needs of their clients.”
Darren Reeder, executive director, Banff and Lake Louise Hospitality Association


“Allowing bed-and-breakfasts greater flexibility when it comes to serving meals offers our customers a better experience while increasing our revenue. I’m very encouraged that the Alberta government is cutting this red tape and making these common-sense changes.”
Caroline, owner, Cozy Corner Guest House 

Food banks will also be able to legally prepare, cook and serve food on site, provided they have the necessary facilities and equipment. The regulation previously prevented food banks from processing and serving food, meaning they could not easily run a soup kitchen.

“This is a common-sense change that I’m proud to make. Food safety regulations should not prevent food banks from helping those in need. We will continue looking for ways to cut unnecessary rules and regulations while always protecting the health and safety of Albertans.”
Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health


“With this amendment, food banks will now be allowed to process and serve food on site. This change will give food banks the ability to add more services to help support people facing food insecurity.”
Stephanie Walsh-Rigby, CEO, Food Banks Alberta

The Government of Alberta is reducing time-consuming administrative tasks required of housing management bodies. As a result, housing providers will have greater capacity to serve the needs of their tenants. 

“We heard directly from our housing partners that reporting to the province can be an administrative burden. Our government listened and we are proud to streamline those processes so providers can focus on providing quality, affordable housing for Albertans most in need.”
Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing


“Cutting red tape by reducing the administrative burden for housing providers allows them to spend more time fulfilling the needs of their tenants and less time signing forms. Thank you, Minister Pon for resolving another red tape headache for the benefit of Albertans.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction


“We’re excited about this change because it will help us further our mission to positively influence seniors’ quality of life. Less time spent on paperwork means we’ll have more time to spend with our seniors – listening to them and ensuring we’re meeting their housing needs.”
Raymond Swonek, CEO, Greater Edmonton Foundation Seniors Housing

Housing providers will see reduced requirements for operational reviews, business plan submissions and reporting on wait-lists and client demographics.
These changes align with our government’s commitment to make the affordable housing system more efficient and effective for applicants and housing providers. Last fall, the government announced a review of the process used by housing management bodies to verify the income and eligibility of applicants. The department is exploring options and assessing potential impacts, with a recommendation expected in the coming weeks.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




An updated guide – The Government of Alberta’s Proponent Guide to First Nations and Metis Settlement Consultation Procedures – outlines a more cost-effective and efficient application process for industry to follow when there is a legal duty to consult.
A duty to consult is triggered when a development project may adversely affect treaty or Aboriginal rights, or cultural or harvesting practices.

“We heard from industry that they wanted to take steps to improve the consultation process. This new guide not only responds to what industry told us, it benefits First Nations and Metis Settlements. The updated guide will help industry come to the table better prepared to address Indigenous people’s concerns. This will make the overall consultation process more effective, informed and respectful.”
Rick Wilson, Minister of Indigenous Relations

The Aboriginal Consultation Office (ACO) will provide training for industry on the changes in process outlined in the guide.
Reducing red tape will improve the consultation process by:

Providing a clearer application process to improve overall consultation and give industry and Indigenous communities more certainty when moving development projects forward.
Reducing delays and costs to industry proponents by ensuring their applications have little chance of having to be returned due to lack of information or errors.  
Ensuring the ACO can better respond to industry needs while increasing the number of applications processed.
Moving more quickly to the development stage of proposed projects.


“These changes should help make consultation more efficient. We believe it will also help us be better prepared when working with Indigenous Peoples on important matters such as treaty or Aboriginal rights and harvesting and cultural practices. We want a process that benefits everyone.”
Al Reid, executive vice-president, Stakeholder Engagement, Safety, Legal & General Counsel, Cenovus Energy Inc.

Premier Jason Kenney and Associate Minister for Red Tape Reduction Grant Hunter receive a B- Grade on the 2020 Red Tape Report Card from CFIB executive vice-president Laura Jones.

After three years of failing grades, this is the first year the Alberta government has received a positive grade. The grade coincides with CFIB’s Red Tape Awareness Week, an event dedicated to raising awareness of red tape that impedes businesses and job creators at all three levels of government.

“I thank the Canadian Federation of Independent Business for recognizing our work to cut the unnecessary red tape that has been affecting the growth of Alberta’s economy. We made a commitment to do this and this grade is evidence that we’re on the right track.”
Premier Jason Kenney

Since the formation of the Associate Ministry of Red Tape Reduction in June 2019, numerous actions have been taken across government to address Alberta’s red tape problems.
Moves that have had a direct and positive result on Albertans include:

Reducing delays for forest management agreements and small-scale and low-impact hydroelectric developments.
Making it easier to provide consent for organ donation through the online registry.
Reclassifying and harmonizing oil well service rigs
Relaxing alcohol consumption rules for parks, campgrounds and festivals.
Introducing the use of e-transfers and multi-year grant agreements to reduce the administrative burden on non-profits so they can focus on delivering programs and services.


“For three straight years, the previous government received a failing grade from the CFIB for their inaction on addressing red tape in Alberta. Now, we received a B-minus – our best grade yet. I’m pleased with our progress, but know there is more work to do to make Alberta one of the freest and fastest moving economies in the world.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction


“The Alberta government has taken quick action on reducing time-consuming, stressful and needless government regulations. Moving from a failing grade to B- recognizes the government does believe in the importance of accountability and developing a measurement to quantify Alberta’s regulatory burden.”

Laura Jones, executive vice-president, Canadian Federation of Independent Business


Last year, the Associate Ministry established industry panels to leverage expert advice from leaders in each sector of Alberta’s economy. Input from Albertans will continue to be sought on our website CutRedTape.Alberta.ca and through engagement with small groups.

“Our association applauds the efforts of the Alberta government to streamline regulations for our industry. The Premier’s leadership and determination to improve competitiveness is refreshing. The recent regulatory reforms for service rigs have reduced unnecessary red tape and gets more rigs working in the field.”

Mark Scholz, president and CEO, Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors



“We are pleased with the progress made on the current government’s red tape reduction initiative thus far. Changes such as extending leases on public lands, allowing site-wide liquor licensing at hotels, and streamlining rules and training for health and safety are all positive for growing Alberta’s tourism and hospitality industry.”
Dave Kaiser, president and CEO, Alberta Hotel & Lodging Association


“CAPP supports the Alberta government’s commitment to reducing red tape. This is an important effort to create jobs and attract investment to our industry and province. We look forward to continuing to work with the government on this valuable initiative.”
Tim McMillan, president and CEO, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers


“I certainly support our government's efforts to reduce red tape. In coordination with the AGLC, they completed comprehensive diligence, agreed policy updates were required, and expeditiously eliminated the undue red tape – ­enhancing the customer experience for guests at Pedal Pub Calgary. The real win here is that our city and province are truly open for business.”
David Skabar, co-founder, Pedal Pub Calgary

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




Strathcona County RCMP had been conducting surveillance from unmarked police vehicles as part of an investigation into stolen vehicles. At approximately 2:55 p.m., they saw a GMC Yukon leaving an address associated with stolen vehicle activity, travelling westbound on Highway 16. Computer checks confirmed the Yukon had been reported stolen. The Yukon turned onto Broadmoor Boulevard in Sherwood Park, entered the Costco parking lot near the gas bar, and stopped. At approximately 3:08 p.m., two unmarked police vehicles activated their lights and siren. In response, the driver of the Yukon placed the vehicle into reverse and quickly accelerated over a grass boulevard and through some trees, before heading northbound onto Broadmoor Boulevard.
At 3:09 p.m., the officers notified RCMP dispatch that the vehicle had fled police and was northbound on Broadmoor Boulevard. At 3:10 p.m., they told dispatch they had lost visual contact with the Yukon as it crossed the Yellowhead Trail overpass. At 3:11 p.m., the RCMP officers received direction over the radio to terminate the pursuit, pull over and turn off their emergency equipment, which the evidence establishes they followed. At 3:18 p.m., RCMP received a 911 call reporting a single-vehicle rollover at the off-ramp of the Sherwood Park Freeway and 17 Street NW. The vehicle in question was the stolen GMC Yukon. Two males exited the rolled vehicle and fled on foot, abandoning a 16-year-old passenger who had been killed in the rollover.
ASIRT conducted a comprehensive investigation in accordance with current best practices. The investigation involved interviews with numerous civilian witnesses and all involved police officers. Additionally, ASIRT obtained extensive GPS data from the police vehicles and the complete communications recordings from the incident. All available video evidence was obtained and analyzed.
ASIRT’s investigation focused on the actions of police leading up to the fatal collision, and whether those actions could reasonably be considered a contributing cause of the passenger’s death.
Police officers are lawfully entitled to pursue fleeing suspects. That said, criminal flight from police creates an inherently dangerous situation for police, the occupants of the fleeing vehicle, and the general public. The decision to pursue a feeing vehicle must be made carefully, and with constant assessment and reassessment of the danger involved. Such considerations were taken into account in this case. Additionally, it is beyond dispute that RCMP members had terminated any attempt to pursue or follow the stolen Yukon well in advance of the single vehicle rollover that ultimately occurred.
Civilian witnesses who had witnessed the rollover were identified and interviewed. None of those witnesses indicated that RCMP vehicles were in pursuit of or in proximity to the Yukon at the time of the rollover. Several of the witnesses described remaining on-scene until police arrived, and indicated that it was several minutes before the first police vehicle arrived. Another civilian witness, who had not stopped at the scene, had recorded dash camera footage of the rollover which revealed two occupants fleeing on foot from the scene and confirmed the absence of any immediate police presence.
As previously stated, police are lawfully entitled to enforce the law and, in doing so, to pursue fleeing vehicles. The risks inherent in that action, however, are significant, and require careful consideration. In this particular case, police made the decision to terminate any pursuit for public safety reasons well in advance of the single vehicle collision. As such, it cannot reasonably be argued that the conduct of police, acting in the lawful execution of their duties, but mindful of public safety, caused or contributed to the death of the passenger in the stolen vehicle.
ASIRT’s completed investigation investigation does not provide reasonable grounds to believe that any RCMP member committed a Criminal Code offence during this incident. While the death the young passenger was both tragic and criminal, both the moral and legal responsibility for his death rests with driver of the stolen vehicle.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person. This mandate includes incidents involving discharge of a firearm that would likely have resulted in serious injury or death had the person been struck.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

James Burns, CEO of Alcanna, Minister Doug Schweitzer, MLA Brad Rutherford, and Cst. Robyn Wilson, Edmonton Police Service, announced action to fight robberies and thefts targeting liquor stores.

Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General, has appointed Brad Rutherford, MLA for Leduc-Beaumont, to chair the working group, which will examine the recent spike in crimes targeting liquor stores. 
Police in Edmonton alone responded to more than 9,500 liquor store thefts in 2019 – an average of 26 a day – triple the 3,273 in 2018.
In addition to costing retailers millions of dollars in financial losses and placing a significant strain on police resources, the current trend poses a continued risk of violence toward workers and bystanders.

“Criminals and gangs are preying on hard-working, law-abiding Albertans and business owners. Our government will work with our partners in law enforcement and in the industry to deter liquor store thefts through better prevention and ensuring appropriate consequences for the perpetrators.”
Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General


“This is an important crime and safety issue that requires thoughtful action. Our partners bring a considerable amount of knowledge and expertise to the discussion and I’m looking forward to hearing their ideas. Together, we can make a difference.”
Brad Rutherford, MLA for Leduc-Beaumont; chair, Liquor Store Theft Working Group


“We are pleased to see the government taking action on the issue of liquor store crime after hearing the concerns brought forth by industry. This problem affects big and small business owners in urban and rural communities and poses a significant threat to the safety of liquor store employees. On behalf of liquor store owners across Alberta, we look forward to finding meaningful solutions.”
Ivonne Martinez, president, Alberta Liquor Store Association; member, Liquor Store Theft Working Group

There is evidence that criminal gangs are fuelling a dramatic increase in liquor store thefts in cities like Edmonton and Calgary, using stolen merchandise as a form of street currency to pay for illegal goods and activities. Many thefts and robberies appear to be planned and co-ordinated events carried out by groups that enter a store and steal a large quantity of liquor in only a few minutes. There have also been several cases of violence toward liquor store employees.
Rutherford, who served as a member of the Edmonton Police Service for 10 years, will chair the working group, which has representatives from law enforcement, liquor retailers, Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis and the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service.
The group will weigh a broad range of actions to deter liquor store thefts, including security features for stores, enforcement strategies, legal measures and deterrence measures, as well as steps taken in other jurisdictions.

(L to R) Associate Minister Grant Hunter; Nathan Satanove, Owner, Pasta Pantry; Rob Plante, Canadian Federation of Independent Business.

The declaration coincides with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’s own Red Tape Awareness Week, which highlights how regulatory burdens from all levels of government impede businesses and negatively affect the economy.

“Red Tape Reduction Awareness week is about celebrating our work in cutting red tape for Albertans, while acknowledging there’s a lot more to be done. Our government has made it clear that we will get Albertans back to work. I’m excited as we move forward into this new year – we have an ambitious agenda ahead of us.”
Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction

This year, Associate Minister Hunter has been named a finalist to receive a Golden Scissors Award from the CFIB. The award is granted to a small handful of organizations and individuals for their leadership in cutting red tape and making it easier for small businesses to thrive. The winners will be announced on Jan. 23, 2020.

 “CFIB is encouraged by the work already undertaken by the Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction to tackle the issue of red tape. Red tape creates headaches and stress for not only small businesses but all citizens. The government has shown commitment and leadership on identifying red tape burdens and implementing initiatives that streamline government services.”
Annie Dormuth, director of Provincial Affairs, Canadian Federation of Independent Business

Red Tape Reduction Awareness Week will highlight successes made over the last half year, announce new actions, and kick off a new year of cutting Alberta’s regulatory burden.

Minister Nicolaides meets with student leaders prior to announcing a new post-secondary funding announcement. 

Under the new funding model, a portion of government funding to colleges, universities and polytechnics will be based on achieving key performance measures. Performance measures will encourage institutions to improve services, increase efficiencies and create opportunities for Albertans through strong labour market outcomes and innovative programs and research.

“This is a new and completely transformative funding model for our universities, colleges and polytechnics. Our new approach will help ensure students are set up for success by encouraging institutions to produce job-ready graduates. Students make a significant investment in their post-secondary education, and it is essential we do everything possible to give them a rewarding career at the end of their studies. By shifting the focus to performance, we will ensure taxpayer dollars are being used in the most responsible way possible.”
Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education


“The University of Calgary has the ability to create the ‘arc to the future’ for Calgary and help re-imagine Alberta. The outcomes-based funding model is not only a tremendous opportunity to transform our post-secondary system, but to graduate a workforce that is capable of adaptation, with the skills and abilities to innovate and to support economic growth and diversification.”
Geeta Sankappanavar, chair, Board of Governors, University of Calgary


“We look forward to working with government to implement the new outcomes-based approach to funding. This approach should improve predictability in government funding levels and enhance accountability for results delivery, both of which will benefit our students.”
Dave Collyer, chair, Board of Governors, Bow Valley College


“Alberta’s post-secondary presidents welcome the opportunity to work with the Government of Alberta, our learners and other stakeholders in building a performance-based model that will enable us to achieve an overall vision for Alberta’s post-secondary system, that builds on the strengths and core mission of each institution, and that maximizes the quality of our learning and research environments so that learners and communities can reach their highest potential.”
Neil Fassina, president of the Council of Post-secondary Presidents of Alberta and president of Athabasca University


“Alberta’s students deserve an institutional funding model that is both modern and evidence-based. ASEC supports the changes made by the Government of Alberta towards a model that fits our values of transparency, accountability, affordability and predictability. We look forward to working with the government in the further development of the Campus Alberta Grant allocation.”
Emmanauel Barker, director, Government Relations and Advocacy, Alberta Students’ Executive Council

In addition to tying public investment to results, government is also transforming its relationship with post-secondary institutions by negotiating three-year funding agreements. Investment management agreements will include specific performance targets for each institution. They will also specify the government funding each institution will receive if they meet their performance targets. Three-year terms will help institutions plan for the future and build on their record of excellence.
The amount of funding tied to performance outcomes will begin at 15 per cent of operational funding for 2020-21 and gradually increase to a maximum of 40 per cent by 2022-23. A small number of performance measures will be introduced for the 2020-21 academic year, and more measures will be gradually introduced over the next three years to a total of about 15.
 Quick facts

Government provides operational funding to 26 universities, colleges and polytechnics every year, but historically, this funding has not been tied to any targets or outcomes. While government provides many different kinds of grants to post-secondary institutions, only operational funding through the Campus Alberta Grant will be tied to performance.
The MacKinnon Report identified that the current post-secondary funding structure does not link funding to the achievement of specific goals or priorities for the province, such as ensuring the required skills for the current and future labour market.
Outcomes-based funding is a global trend in higher education. About 35 U.S. states use a form of performance-based funding. Over the past 10 years, additional jurisdictions have implemented various methods of performance-based funding, such as the United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Poland, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong.
While performance measures will be finalized after discussions with post-secondary institutions, students and faculty, some examples may include:
	
graduate employment rate
median graduate income
graduate skills and competencies
work-integrated learning opportunities
administrative expense ratio
sponsored research revenue
enrolment (including potential targets for domestic students, international students and under-represented learners)


Performance measures will also be weighted differently depending on the institution. For example, different performance measures will be more important to different kinds of institutions.
Institutions that meet all of their targets will receive 100 per cent of their allocated funding.
If an institution does not meet its targets, the institution will receive funding that is proportionate to its level of achievement. For example, if an institution achieves 90 per cent of its target, it will receive 90 per cent of its funding for that target.

“Alberta is blessed with the beautiful Rocky Mountains, but that also means we are no stranger to avalanches.
“Avalanche Awareness Days, Jan. 18-19, is an important opportunity to remind winter recreationists of the tools available to help ensure a safe and enjoyable experience in our mountain regions.
“Avalanche Canada, in partnership with the Government of Alberta and other Canadian jurisdictions, agencies and organizations, provides a suite of services – including daily avalanche forecasts, avalanche safety training and focused outreach programs and events – that educate winter backcountry recreationists and travellers of imminent avalanche danger and conditions. In doing so, visitors to our avalanche regions are better prepared when they sled, ski, snowshoe and hike Alberta’s mountain winter playground.
“I wish to commend frontline staff, including Environment and Parks Kananaskis Public Safety team, for their expertise, commitment and response to avalanche incidents, prevention and safety, knowing in some situations they risk their own lives in service to others. It is imperative that winter recreationists be aware of the eventuality of an avalanche through a few simple preparations, like checking avalanche forecasts and accessing Avalanche Canada’s training courses.
“The Scouts’ motto, ‘Be Prepared,’ is an applicable piece of avalanche advice to help reduce the loss of life that is unfortunately inherent in some winter mountain pursuits, especially in the backcountry.
“Play safe and be prepared.”

“My thoughts are with the Wetaskiwin residents who lost housing following the recent fire. Please know there are supports available through the AHS Community Addiction and Mental Health office and after hours from the community crisis response team by visiting the emergency department.
“Our government is committed to improving access to mental health and addiction treatment and recovery supports across the province.
“The new team in Wetaskiwin highlights our commitment to improve our system of care by using existing resources more efficiently. We will continue to create new treatment spaces where they are needed, to ensure every Albertan who needs support can get it, no matter where they live.”

“Jan. 17 is International Mentoring Day, on which we recognize the thousands of mentors across the province who play critical roles in the lives of young Albertans every day.
“Mentoring helps young people by strengthening their skills, increasing their self-confidence and expanding their knowledge, while helping them better cope with stress, challenges and life experiences.
“We are proud to support mentoring programs in our communities and schools across the province through funding and ongoing support of the Alberta Mentoring Partnership program.
“Government support for mentorship programs creates opportunities for Indigenous, immigrant and gender-diverse children and youth, as well as those who are vulnerable due to homelessness, justice involvement or child intervention involvement, to have one-on-one support and encouragement from a caring adult. It helps them establish lifelong social and emotional supports in their community. The Government of Alberta has maintained $1.5 million for this program through the Community Partnerships Youth Grant Program. 
“Sometimes, all a child needs is one person who will pick up the phone when they call. That person can be a mentor. For providing that truly invaluable support, we thank all the mentors in Alberta.”

“The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld the rule of law and put an end to the British Columbia government’s campaign of obstruction against Alberta energy. We are pleased that the court unanimously dismissed B.C.’s appeal of a 5-0 decision by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which ruled the B.C. government does not have constitutional authority to stop the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion through delay, uncertainty and the likely prospect of future litigation. By ensuring that B.C. must respect the federal government’s rigorous process in approving TMX, this outcome will have major ramifications for the project and its profound importance to Albertans and all Canadians.
“This is the decision we expected. British Columbia’s own top court was clear that the proposed law is ‘an… existential threat to a federal undertaking that is being expanded specifically to increase the amount of oil transported through British Columbia.’ The B.C. court’s decision was an affirmation of the unique economic union among Canada’s provinces.
“Building the TMX and ensuring a fair price for our natural resources will create thousands of new jobs and increased prosperity that will benefit the entire country. We are pleased with the decision by our country’s highest court and look forward to the continued construction of the Trans Mountain Pipeline.”

“Jason took on responsibilities like these with a deep commitment to fairness and transparency. He was the first band councillor to publish the band’s financials in the Lethbridge Herald, and it was work like this that caught the attention of the Native Nations Institute and the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




In a Jan. 15 meeting, Sean N. Cantelon, CEO of Canadian Forces Morale and Welfare Services, spoke with Service Alberta Minister Nate Glubish and military liaison Brad Rutherford to express his personal thanks and appreciation for Alberta’s ongoing support for the Canadian Armed Forces through its specialty licence plate program.
The province launched its Support Our Troops program in 2014 and Albertans have responded strongly – purchasing nearly 45,000 plates since then. This public support has resulted in almost $2.5 million raised for Support Our Troops. The Canadian Armed Forces official charitable cause is operated by Canadian Forces Morale and Welfare Services. Support Our Troops provides financial support and assistance to military members and families who make Alberta their home.

“The men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces provide a tremendous service to our province, country and the international community and it is difficult to find ways to express our appreciation to them and their families for their service and sacrifice. This program enables Albertans to show their support in a small, but meaningful way. It is inspiring to see these plates on so many Alberta vehicles, knowing the significant difference these donations have made to the lives of military families.”
Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta


“There is no higher form of public service than to risk one’s life in defence of our country or in maintaining public safety. Albertans share a great pride in our military members and so does our government. We are proud to support the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces and their families with the Support Our Troops licence plate program, which provides funding for an array of important services. I encourage all Albertans to participate in this valuable program.”
Brad Rutherford, MLA for Leduc-Beaumont, liaison to the Canadian Armed Forces


“We truly appreciate the Province of Alberta’s endorsement and support of this program, which serves as an excellent role model for other provinces who are putting in place similar programs.”
Sean N. Cantelon, CEO, Canadian Forces Morale and Welfare Services

Funds raised from the Support Our Troops specialty licence plate program help current and former members of the Canadian Armed Forces and their families in Alberta through organizations that provide support for children’s programs, scholarships, family assistance, veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, and other initiatives.
Quick facts

Support Our Troops, the official charitable cause of the Canadian Armed Forces, exists to meet the unique needs and special challenges faced by members of the Canadian Armed Forces community as a result of military service.
Specialty plates are sold at Alberta registry offices for $75 plus applicable registry fees.
Of the total cost, $55 goes directly to the Canadian Armed Forces Support Our Troops program.
The government retains $20 from each plate sold to offset the cost of production and mailing.

Alberta’s MLAs will return to the Legislature for a Speech from the Throne which will outline the government’s legislative agenda for the year ahead.
It promises to be another busy and engaging sitting. Government will continue to focus on creating jobs, expanding the province’s economy and standing up for a fair deal for Albertans.

“I’m thrilled to be getting back to the important work of fulfilling our unprecedented slate of promises to Albertans. I sincerely look forward to seeing my colleagues back at the Legislature in order to move our ambitious legislative agenda forward. I have no doubt that this will be another spring of renewal for the people of Alberta as we focus on jobs, the economy and pipelines.”
Jason Nixon, Government House Leader

Government has already delivered on 43 per cent of its commitments to Albertans. The 94 promises kept through late summer and the fall 2019 Session are on top of the 68 promises kept during this government’s first 100 days. Government made 375 platform promises during the 2019 election campaign.

ASIRT’s investigation was comprehensive and thorough and conducted using current investigative protocols. ASIRT interviewed all relevant civilian and police witnesses, including both officers present at the time of the incident. ASIRT obtained dispatch records, including radio communications, and obtained an expert report regarding the weapon the man had in his possession. The scene was carefully scrutinized and examined and documented through extensive photographs. 
While in uniform and on patrol in separate marked police vehicles on Oct. 19, 2017, officers noted a blue Ford Explorer parked facing northbound in the southbound lane of Haskayne Avenue, a main thoroughfare in Gleichen. The vehicle was parked near a residence that was known to be associated with the local drug trade. At approximately 3:40 a.m., the vehicle was observed to still be parked in the same location, with its lights off, and it appeared to be occupied by a man in the driver’s seat. The driver’s head was cocked back “awkwardly,” his mouth was wide open and he did not appear to be conscious or moving. A spotlight from one of the police vehicles was directed towards the front of the Explorer.
The two uniformed officers exited their marked police vehicles and approached the Explorer on foot, with one officer on the driver’s side and the other officer on the passenger’s side. Both officers knocked on the vehicle’s windows. The man did not wake up, but did appear to be breathing. At this point, the officer standing at the driver’s side window observed what appeared to be a firearm placed between the man’s legs, and informed the other officer. The second officer returned to his vehicle to retrieve a carbine, and again approached the vehicle on the passenger side. 
The officers initially planned for the officer on the driver’s side to open the door and grab the firearm while the other officer provided cover, but the driver’s door was locked. The officer on the driver’s side then tried to break the driver’s side window with his flashlight, while armed with his service pistol in his other hand. The flashlight failed to break the window but did rouse the man inside. The officers shouted verbal commands identifying themselves as police and informing the occupant of the vehicle that he was under arrest. The man looked directly at the officer on the driver’s side of the vehicle and swore at the officer. As the man’s hands went towards the firearm, both officers again shouted commands to show his hands. The man failed to respond and continued to reach for the firearm, prompting the officer on the driver’s side of the vehicle to fire his service pistol, wounding the man, while the officer repositioned himself towards the front of the Explorer.
Police recovered the man’s firearm, which appeared to be some form of homemade shotgun, between the driver’s door and driver’s seat of the vehicle. The man was removed from the Explorer to be examined and treated by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel on scene, who determined that the man was deceased.
 
Homemade firearm recovered from the scene of the fatal officer-involved shooting in Gleichen.

Following the officer-involved shooting, the man was identified to be a 26-year-old resident of Morley, Alberta. The man had a prior criminal history and was prohibited from the possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives as a result of a prior criminal conviction. The identity of the man and his prior criminal history, however, were unknown to the officers at the time of the incident. 
An autopsy conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), determined the man’s cause of death to be multiple gunshot wounds. There was no evidence of close-range gunfire. Two shotgun shells, two glass drug pipes, several small bags consistent with drug packaging and a quantity of unknown white pills were found in the man’s pockets. A toxicology report revealed the presence of alcohol, methamphetamine, amphetamine, cocaine and cannabis in the man’s system. 
Several civilian witnesses who had been with the man earlier that evening, prior to the incident, provided statements to ASIRT investigators. Three witnesses in particular described troubling conversations with the man. One witness detailed the man’s consumption of both alcohol and drugs, confirming that the man had been left passed out in the driver’s seat of the Explorer. This witness indicated that the man had been talking about his own death and funeral as if he knew something was going to happen.
A second witness said that the man said that police were watching him and waiting to stop him. He said he would not stop for police and that they should fasten their seatbelts. The witness indicated that the man retrieved a “homemade” firearm, about two feet in length, and put it on the dashboard, and displayed several rounds of ammunition, tossing them in his hand. The man had previously shown this witness the firearm a few weeks earlier. The witness also confirmed that the man appeared to be making comments about what he believed to be his own impending death. The man had previously stated that he would not go back to jail and that, upon contact, he would have a shootout with police.
A third person who was with the man earlier that evening described the man’s recent state of mind as “freaked out” and “paranoid all the time.” On the night of the incident, the man indicated that if he came into contact with police, it was his intention to engage in a “shootout” with them. This witness also confirmed the man had the homemade firearm with him in the Explorer.  
The man’s firearm was a homemade single-shot 12-gauge shotgun, consisting of a metal pipe and wooden stock, with a firing pin. It appeared to have all the necessary components to function as a firearm. At the time of testing, however, it was determined that although the firing pin would strike the primer, it was too short and, as such, a round was not discharged when the firing pin struck. To be clear, it was inoperable. Given the homemade nature of the firearm, it is unknown if this was the result of wear or whether the firearm had ever been operational. It would have appeared to be a firearm and it would have been impossible for police to know whether it was functioning.
Under the Criminal Code, police officers are granted certain powers and authorities to facilitate the performance of what can be a challenging job. A police officer is authorized to use as much force as is reasonably necessary in administration or enforcement of the law. This can, in limited circumstances, include force that is intended or likely to cause grievous bodily harm or death. Lethal force is only authorized in circumstances where an officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of anyone under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm. Also, any person, including a police officer, is entitled to the use of reasonable force in defence of themselves or another person. 
In this case, having observed the firearm within the vehicle, the officers were lawfully entitled to investigate and seize the weapon and take the man into custody and, in doing so, to use as much force as was reasonably necessary. The subsequent actions of the man, in persistently reaching for what reasonably appeared to be a firearm -- despite repeated verbal commands by the officers --  created a situation that reasonably gave rise to a fear of death or grievous bodily harm on the part of the officers. Accordingly, following a full investigation and assessment of the evidence, there are no reasonable grounds, or even reasonable suspicion, to believe that the officers committed any Criminal Code offence(s).
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person.

This release is distributed by the Government of Alberta on behalf of the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team.

On that day at approximately 4:10 a.m., a marked Edmonton Police Service (EPS) vehicle was on patrol northeast of the city when officers observed a possible break and enter in progress at a gas station at 24400 Highway 37. A Dodge truck was backed up to the gas station and the door to the building was damaged. 
When officers arrived, the individuals inside the gas station ran back to the Dodge truck and tried to leave the scene. Contact was made between the truck and the EPS vehicle, and at this point EPS members fired their service pistols. A pursuit ensued southbound on Highway 28, and the truck entered the ditch near a residential area. One occupant of the truck fled on foot. The truck was able to exit the ditch, and again contact occurred between the two vehicles. EPS members again discharged their service pistols. The truck fled again, eventually stopping due to a collision with a tree. At this point, the remaining three occupants of the truck were arrested without further incident. The individual who fled on foot was apprehended separately.   
A 37-year-old man who had been a passenger in the truck sustained two gunshot wounds to the leg, which resulted in non-life-threatening injuries. Police provided medical care to the man until the arrival of Emergency Medical Services. Upon the arrival of EMS, the man was treated and transported to hospital, where he was treated and released into the custody of EPS. No one else was injured during the course of this incident.
ASIRT’s investigation will focus on the actions of police during this incident, while EPS will maintain responsibility for the investigation into any offences that may have been committed by the four individuals apprehended by police. As the investigation is underway, no further information will be released at this time.
ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

Members of the public will have opportunities to make their voices heard and provide input informing Budget 2020.
An online survey with questions on Albertans’ spending and saving priorities, as well as ideas for job creation and growing Alberta’s economy, is open until Feb. 7.
Government will host two telephone town hall meetings on Jan. 27 and Jan. 28. These town halls give Albertans an opportunity to speak directly to the finance minister and provide feedback to be used in the development of Budget 2020. More information on the telephone town halls and how to participate can be found at alberta.ca/budgetconsultation.

“Leading up to Budget 2019, we heard from more than 4,000 people online and almost 35,000 people during our telephone town halls. Albertans demonstrated that they have incredible insight into the choices we must make together to create jobs,  get out of debt and grow our economy. As we continue on this path, I want to hear your thoughts. We made a good start in Budget 2019 and we need to keep that momentum going.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance

The public input will help inform Budget 2020, scheduled to be released this spring.

On that day at approximately 2:25 a.m., a motion alarm was activated at a business in an industrial area of Cold Lake. The business owner contacted the RCMP, who were dispatched to the location in response to the possible break and enter. One RCMP member arrived and used his police vehicle to block in a suspect vehicle, which was in the alley behind the business. A confrontation occurred between the officer and the occupants of the suspect vehicle that led to the RCMP member firing his service pistol, striking the 26-year-old male driver of the vehicle. Once the vehicle stopped, police arrested the driver and a 46-year-old female passenger without further incident.
The man sustained a single gunshot wound to the leg, which resulted in injuries that weren’t considered life-threatening. Police provided medical care to the man until the arrival of Emergency Medical Services. Upon the arrival of EMS, the man was treated and transported to hospital, where he was treated before being released into RCMP custody.
No one else was injured during the course of this incident.

“These independent public sector wage arbitration outcomes reflect the current economic realities in the province. The decisions align with the crucial need to fix Alberta’s spending problem and ensure the long-term sustainability of high quality services for Albertans.
“As the MacKinnon panel identified, public sector compensation accounts for more than half of government expenses and wages are, on average, substantially higher than other large provinces.
“Correcting wages over time is a critical part of our government’s commitment to get our fiscal house in order. Even with these decisions, fiscal restraint and discipline must continue as we enter into new collective bargaining negotiations in 2020.
“As we said at Budget 2019, there is no new money for public sector raises in the fiscal plan.
“We have a great deal of respect and admiration for Alberta’s public sector workers. The need for wage restraint does not diminish our recognition for the hard work they do for Albertans.”

The open houses will share details on fisheries management in Alberta and collect public feedback on proposals to open up additional opportunities for recreational harvest at specific lakes. Beginning Jan. 13, interested anglers may also submit feedback online at TalkAEP.Alberta.ca.

“Whether you prefer making the trek to a favorite spot off the beaten path or taking the kids to a stocked pond just outside the city, fishing is a part of Alberta’s cultural fabric. We promised to modernize a number of the province’s environmental provisions, and we look forward to listening to Albertans’ feedback. As an enthusiastic angler and outdoorsman, I look forward to working together to make our fisheries strong, healthy, vibrant and sustainable for generations to come.”
Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

Feedback will be reflected in the 2020 Alberta Sportfishing Regulations, which come into effect on April 1.

“Alberta has been enriched by a small but dynamic and highly educated Iranian community. This is a terrible day for them, and I am sure that all Albertans join with me in expressing our condolences to the entire community, which is affected by this disaster.
“I thank the Government of Canada for pressing for an investigation into this crash, and offering support to the victims’ families.”

“First Nations leaders increasingly recognize that responsible natural resource development can serve as a path from poverty to prosperity for their people. Yet this UN body seemingly ignores these voices.

“Blessed Christmas to all members of our Apostolic, Orthodox and Eastern Christian communities who are celebrating the Julian Christmas this week.
“Your communities have done so much to enrich Alberta. You have all contributed immensely to this province: from the Ukrainian pioneers who arrived in this place over a century ago to plough virgin soil and help settle the Canadian Prairies, right up to recent arrivals as refugees from the Middle East – people who have faced persecution, but now have the protection, security and the religious freedom given by Canada.
“To all of you as you gather with your families and your communities this week, I hope that you’ll have an enriching celebration of the Feast of the Nativity.
“There’s an ancient Arabic Christmas chant that says:
‘Today is born of a virgin, He who holds the whole creation in His hand. Today, he whose essence none can touch, is bound in swaddling clothes, as a child.’
“That is the miracle of Christmas, and we can help to demonstrate that in our own lives, through small acts of kindness, especially to those who are in need. I encourage all Albertans at this time of year to live the idea of Christmas as a gift, by giving of yourselves to those who are less fortunate, by reaching out to those who might be alone or isolated. And by thanking, especially, our emergency personnel who care for us over the holidays.
“So to all of our Apostolic, Eastern and Orthodox communities, to all of you celebrating Byzantine Christmas today and this week, may you be richly blessed.
“Merry Christmas!”

The Fair Deal Panel is consulting Albertans on how best to define and secure a fair deal for the province. The panel members are exploring ideas that give the province a bigger voice within the federation, increase power over areas of provincial jurisdiction and advance vital economic interests.
The Fort McMurray town hall is taking place on Wednesday, Jan. 8 from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Quality Inn and Conference Centre. Seating capacity is limited so participants should register to attend.
The town hall in Fort Saskatchewan is on Thursday, Jan. 9 from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Lion’s Banquet Hall in the Dow Centennial Centre. Capacity is limited, so those interested in attending should register in advance.
Albertans are encouraged to attend local town hall sessions and share their vision of how Alberta can achieve a fairer deal.
All Albertans will have the opportunity to provide their input online and through other forms of direct feedback as the panel conducts its public consultations until Jan. 30. More information on how to participate is available at www.fairdeal.ca.
In addition to receiving input from Albertans, the Fair Deal Panel will consult with policy experts and undertake research to inform its recommendations. The panel will complete its report to the government by March 31.

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




This fall, the Public Health Agency of Canada alerted provincial health officials and asked them to report any probable and confirmed cases as part of the national investigation underway.

“We are actively monitoring the situation in Alberta and working with health officials across Canada to share information and better understand this illness. I want to remind all Albertans that vaping has health risks, and the only way to completely avoid these risks is by not vaping.”
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health

In September, Dr. Hinshaw named the severe vaping-associated lung illness a notifiable condition under the Public Health Act, requiring Alberta physicians to report potential cases to public health officials. All adverse events have since been investigated using the case definition being used across Canada.
The Alberta case marks the 15th vaping-associated lung illness reported in the country, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. The patient has received treatment and is recovering at home. To protect patient confidentiality, additional details will not be publicly released.
Public health officials continue to advise Albertans that vaping is not without risk and the long-term health impacts remain unknown. Anytime you breathe unknown substances into your lungs, it can have health impacts.
Last fall, the Alberta government launched a review of Alberta’s Tobacco and Smoking Reduction Act exploring ways to better protect Albertans from the harms of tobacco, vaping, and tobacco-like products, including addressing the alarming rise in teen vaping. A final report is expected to be provided to the Minister of Health in the coming weeks.

“Alzheimer’s Awareness Month is an opportunity to focus on people living with this devastating dementia, and the communities that walk these difficult journeys alongside them.
“Alzheimer’s and all forms of dementia often present barriers like fear and stigma. Patients hide their symptoms and even resist treatment while this form of dementia robs them of their memories and independence. Meanwhile, families and communities face challenges as they provide support and resources to those living with Alzheimer’s.
“I invite all Albertans to join me in honouring the humanity and enormous courage of people with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia, and the people who care for them. It’s an illness that is likely to touch us all, and it’s a path best walked together.”

Some parts of this page will not display.JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off.




This scheduled tax reduction, effective Jan. 1, improves Alberta’s competitiveness and encourages businesses to invest and hire in the province. 
Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) announced plans to expand its operations in response to the Job Creation Tax Cut. In early December, CNRL increased its 2020 capital budget by $250 million, which they estimate will create about 1,000 new full-time jobs for Albertans.
TELUS also announced a $16-billion investment in Alberta over the next five years connecting businesses and homes across the province to fibre and preparing for 5G. The investment comes with an anticipated 5,000 jobs over the course of the project.

“It will take time to reverse the damage done to Alberta’s economy, but we are seeing positive signs that the Job Creation Tax Cut is working. We expect more good news of increased investment as the rate continues to decrease and businesses make new plans. We will continue to work to attract investment to Alberta.”
Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance


“By lowering taxes on job creators, the Alberta government is trying to get Albertans back to work the right way. These tax reductions will help Albertans get back on their feet and get ahead.""
Franco Terrazzano, Alberta director, Canadian Taxpayers Federation

Alberta’s general corporate income tax rate is the lowest in Canada. Alberta’s combined federal-provincial corporate tax rate will be lower than that of 44 U.S. states when it reaches 8.0 per cent on Jan. 1, 2022.
Alberta’s low cost of doing business makes it one of the most enticing places to invest in North America. Businesses that invest in Alberta benefit from low business tax rates, enhanced capital cost allowances and our government’s ongoing efforts to cut red tape.
Economic indicators

Non-residential investment in Alberta’s business sector was up by 4.7 per cent year-over-year in the third quarter of 2019, the first annual increase since the second quarter of 2018.
With strong growth in housing starts through the summer, investment in residential construction has improved by more than 21 per cent in 2019 from the multi-year lows seen in late 2018.
Building permits, a leading indicator of construction activity, have improved in three of the last four months and were up 3.8 per cent year-over-year in October.
In October, home sales rebounded by more than 11 per cent since they reached an eight-year low in February. Compared to the same month last year, home sales were up by 8.8 per cent.
Average weekly earnings have also picked up. Compared with last year, earnings were up by 1.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2019.

“Happy new year, everyone!
“For most folks, New Year’s Day is about a couple of things. First of all, looking back with gratitude on those things that have gone well in the last year – the blessings or gifts that we have received. It’s also a chance to look to the year forward with a sense of hopefulness, as a new beginning.
“You know, we Albertans have been through a lot of challenges over the last four or five years, but we still have a lot about which we should be grateful. We still live in one of the very best places in the world. And I believe that 2020 will be a year of change – of positive growth, of opportunity. I hope that is what it will be for you and your family, especially for those Albertans who have been struggling in recent months and years.
“So from me to all of you, on behalf of the Government of Alberta, I hope that 2020 will be a year of peace, joy, prosperity and hope.
“Happy new year!”
