For this, Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw recognized them numerous times for their actions. “Other serious challenges to Indigenous well-being include adequate housing, personal safety and access to economic wealth.    “In a spirit of reconciliation, we are doing our best to address these issues.

The total value of the mask contracts is $4.2 million. “When the school re-entry plan was announced on June 10 and a decision on how students would return to school was announced on July 21, it was indicated that the decision on masks in schools was still pending, as Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw was still considering emerging scientific evidence from other jurisdictions. Despite this pending decision, Alberta Education, in conjunction with the Provincial Operations Centre (POC), began preparing for the contingency should Dr. Hinshaw decide to recommend masking in schools. “Given the expediency required, the POC has directly approached experienced, established vendors to fulfil personal protective equipment (PPE) needs for school reopenings. Government of Alberta contracting policies allow for this expedited process in urgent situations, as a standard request for proposal tendering process would not allow the government to fulfil our schools’ needs in the timely manner required. “Alberta has excelled at the urgent need to purchase PPE. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the POC has successfully procured more than six million masks, and the Pandemic Response Planning Team has also procured more than six million masks. This does not include the 185 million clinical masks purchased directly by Alberta Health Services. Forty million masks were also distributed directly to Albertans.  “Both Alberta Education and the POC are confident that masks, sanitizer, thermometers and face shields will be distributed to school divisions prior to the resumption of classes. Students, schools and staff will receive their PPE for the beginning of the school year. “We understand the eagerness of some local businesses to help with the effort. Often, these are businesses that manufactured non-PPE products prior to the pandemic and/or have more limited production capacity. We sincerely appreciate the enthusiasm of those wanting to help. That said, our primary objective is ensuring the large volume of reusable masks can be obtained and distributed in time for the start of the school year.”  Media inquiries                                               Colin Aitchison                                           780-940-0952 Press Secretary, Education    "

The government has also provided a grant of $1.8 million for a wastewater collection upgrade in Plamondon as a part of $150 million in water infrastructure grants supporting Alberta’s economic recovery. Two new lift stations will move wastewater from Plamondon to Lac La Biche.  “Alberta’s Recovery Plan is about creating jobs today while ensuring our province has the infrastructure to support our growth in the future. These improvements to vital infrastructure in Plamondon will do just that: create jobs when they are needed most, while building lasting projects to make life better. Our recovery plan will get Albertans working again all across our province.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “This project will ensure a safe and improved driving surface through the community of Plamondon while getting Albertans back to work. I commend the work of the County of Lac La Biche in helping us move this project forward. It’s another great example of provincial-municipal cooperation.” Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation  The paving project, estimated at $400,000, will be administered by the County of Lac La Biche and is expected to be tendered and completed this summer. The wastewater upgrade will divert wastewater from the hamlet’s existing lagoon to the biological nutrient removal plant, which will significantly reduce the amount of phosphorus, nitrogen and ammonia in treated wastewater.  “It’s wonderful to see Alberta’s government continue to invest in rural communities throughout our province. Repairing our roads and building new wastewater infrastructure are part of the larger economic recovery plan Alberta’s government has put together. Not only will this support long-term economic growth, but also immediately provide jobs for Albertans.” Laila Goodridge, MLA for Fort McMurray-Lac La Biche   “Building and supporting rural infrastructure in Alberta is key. Our County is pleased that the province recognizes that all Albertans must be served equally regardless of where they live by paving Main Street Plamondon, one of our municipality’s main centres. We look forward to continuing to work with our colleagues in the Government of Alberta and the Ministry of Transportation.” Omer Moghrabi, Mayor of Lac La Biche County  Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure we are benefitting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive. Quick facts  The 800-metre section of Highway 858 through Plamondon requires repaving to repair potholes and pavement cuts made during the repair of underground utilities. The Government of Alberta will fund the estimated $400,000 cost of the Highway 858 paving project. About 280 vehicles per day travel through Plamondon. The Government of Alberta is providing a grant of $1.8 million for the two new lift stations to move wastewater from Plamondon to Lac La Biche About 350 residents in Plamondon will benefit from these wastewater system improvements.   Des travaux d’asphaltage et d’amélioration des eaux usées créent des emplois à Plamondon Le gouvernement de l’Alberta donne du travail aux Albertains en asphaltant un tronçon de 800 mètres de la route 858 qui traverse le hameau de Plamondon. Afin de soutenir la reprise économique de l'Alberta, le gouvernement a également accordé une subvention de 1,8 million de dollars pour moderniser la collecte des eaux usées à Plamondon dans le cadre d'une subvention de 150 millions de dollars qui financera divers travaux d’infrastructure hydraulique. Deux nouveaux postes de relèvement permettront d’acheminer les eaux usées de Plamondon vers le lac La Biche.  « Le plan de relance de l'Alberta vise à créer des emplois aujourd'hui tout en garantissant que notre province dispose de l'infrastructure nécessaire pour soutenir notre croissance à l'avenir. Les travaux d’amélioration des infrastructures vitales de Plamondon permettront justement de créer des emplois au moment où ils sont le plus nécessaires, et ils mettront en place des infrastructures durables qui amélioreront la vie des Albertains et des Albertaines. Notre plan de relance permettra à la population de toute la province de retrouver du travail. » Jason Kenney, Premier ministre   « Ce projet permettra la construction d’une surface de conduite sûre et améliorée dans la collectivité de Plamondon tout en permettant aux Albertains de retrouver du travail. Je salue le travail du comté de Lac La Biche qui nous a aidés à faire avancer ce projet. Voilà un autre excellent exemple de collaboration provinciale-municipale réussie. » Ric McIver, ministre des Transports  Le projet d’asphaltage, estimé à 400 000 dollars, sera administré par le comté de Lac La Biche; il devrait faire l'objet d'un appel d'offres et être achevé dès cet été. Le projet d’amélioration des eaux usées permettra de détourner les eaux usées de la lagune existante du hameau vers l'usine d'élimination biologique des nutriments, ce qui réduira considérablement la quantité de phosphore, d'azote et d'ammoniac dans les eaux usées traitées.  « C'est merveilleux de voir le gouvernement de l'Alberta continuer à investir dans les communautés rurales de notre province. La réparation de nos routes et la construction de nouvelles infrastructures de traitement des eaux usées font partie du plan de relance économique élargi mis en place par le gouvernement de l'Alberta. Ce projet permettra non seulement de soutenir la croissance économique à long terme de la province, mais aussi de créer des emplois dès maintenant pour les Albertains. » Laila Goodridge, députée de Fort McMurray-Lac La Biche   « Les projets de construction et de soutien de l’infrastructure rurale sont essentiels en Alberta. En asphaltant la rue principale de Plamondon, l'un des principaux carrefours de notre municipalité, la province reconnaît que tous les Albertains et toutes les Albertaines doivent être servis de la même façon, quel que soit leur lieu de résidence, et notre comté s’en réjouit. Nous avons hâte de continuer à travailler avec nos collègues du gouvernement de l'Alberta et du ministère des Transports. » Omer Moghrabi, maire du comté de Lac La Biche  Le plan de relance de l'Alberta est une stratégie à long terme audacieuse et ambitieuse qui vise à créer, diversifier et consolider des dizaines de milliers d'emplois dès maintenant. En construisant des écoles, des routes et d'autres installations de base, nous profitons à nos collectivités. En diversifiant notre économie et en attirant des investissements grâce à l'environnement fiscal le plus concurrentiel du Canada, nous mettons l'Alberta sur la voie de la croissance. L'Alberta s'est unie pour sauver des vies en aplatissant la courbe et nous devons maintenant faire de même pour sauver les gagne-pain de la population, croître et prospérer. En bref  Le revêtement du tronçon de 800 mètres de l'autoroute 858 qui traverse Plamondon doit être refait pour réparer les nids de poule et les coupures de chaussée faites lors de la réparation des services publics souterrains. Le gouvernement de l'Alberta financera le coût estimé à 400 000 dollars du projet d'asphaltage de l'autoroute 858. Environ 280 véhicules traversent Plamondon tous les jours. Le gouvernement de l’Alberta accorde une subvention de 1,8 million de dollars pour la construction de deux postes de relèvement qui permettront de transporter les eaux usées de Plamondon au lac La Biche. Environ 350 résidents de Plamondon bénéficieront de ces travaux d’amélioration du système d’assainissement.      Media inquiries                                               McKenzie Kibler                                           780-203-1487  Press Secretary, Transportation | Attaché de presse,  Ministère des Transports    "

The global pandemic and the opportunistic Russia-Saudi oil price war has sent shock waves throughout the world economy, and Alberta is not immune from the effects. What’s more, many Albertans have never fully recovered from the downturn in 2014-15. “We must remain vigilant in combatting COVID-19. At the same time, Alberta’s government is pursuing our ambitious recovery plan, including:  A record-setting $10 billion investment in infrastructure spending. Accelerating the Job Creation Tax Cut (the lowest corporate tax in Canada) to ensure Alberta remains the best place for employer investment in Canada.

Investing almost $28 million to create jobs and spur investment in the agriculture and agri-food industries. Launching the Invest Alberta Corporation to boost investment attraction efforts in key markets, such as energy, agriculture, tourism, technology, aviation, aerospace and financial services, with major partners around the globe.  “While some demand that Alberta hike taxes on job creators by a whopping 50 per cent, we’ve seen before the disastrous effects of such policies in economically uncertain times.

Premier Jason Kenney has signalled the intent for Alberta to enter into a memorandum of understanding with Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick to support the development of versatile and scalable small modular reactors (SMRs). SMRs are smaller than traditional nuclear reactors and scalable to suit local needs, with lower upfront capital costs and enhanced safety features. This new and versatile technology could supply non-emitting, low-cost energy for on-grid and off-grid communities in Alberta, including remote and rural areas of the province, as well as industries with a significant need for steam, such as Alberta’s oil sands.  “Our government is exploring all opportunities that could help diversify our economy and create jobs for Albertans. We are building on our track record of responsible and innovative energy production by exploring the potential for small modular reactors, which have the potential to generate reliable and affordable energy, while also strengthening our traditional resource sectors and reducing emissions. We are excited to collaborate with our provincial partners to stay ahead of the game in the development of this promising technology.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “Alberta’s rich uranium deposits, respected innovation and research sector, and technically skilled and educated workforce could make us an attractive destination to develop and deploy SMRs. By signing on to this agreement, our government is taking another step to attract investment and job creators to our province by ensuring we have the appropriate regulatory framework in place should private industry decide to pursue this emerging technology.” Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy  Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure we are benefiting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive. Quick facts  SMRs are nuclear reactors that are smaller and more flexible than conventional nuclear reactors. SMRs would be small enough to be built in a factory and shipped by truck, rail or ship. A typical SMR would generate between two and 300 megawatts of electricity, which could provide power for a village or small city. In comparison, a conventional nuclear reactor can generate 600 to 1,000 megawatts, which can provide power for a large city. SMRs could operate independently or be linked to multiple units, depending on the required amount of power. In November 2018, the federal government released the Canadian Small Modular Reactor Roadmap that outlines recommendations for collaboration among federal, provincial and territorial governments, Indigenous communities and other stakeholders to support SMR development in Canada.   In February 2020, the federal government announced plans for a fall 2020 launch of Canada’s SMR Action Plan, which will outline progress and ongoing efforts across Canada.   In December 2019, New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan signed a memorandum of understanding to work together to support the development and deployment of SMRs. Canada is the second largest uranium producer in the world, with about 15 per cent of total world production. The Athabasca Basin, which straddles the northern Alberta-Saskatchewan border, contains some of the greatest uranium resources in the world.

Investments in Alberta’s fish hatchery facilities will better support sustainable recreational fishing opportunities, the province’s conservation goals, and a healthy aquatic ecosystem and our economy.” Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks   “Fishing opportunities are abundant on our beautiful area lakes and I’m proud of this investment that will help stimulate our local economy by attracting anglers from near and far, particularly as we recover from the pandemic.” David Hanson, MLA for Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul   “The Alberta Fish and Game Association (AFGA) is appreciative of the capital investment and refurbishment plans of the Cold Lake Fish Hatchery by the Government of Alberta, and we look forward to increased angling opportunities and improved fisheries for Alberta’s angling community.” Brian Dingreville, president, Alberta Fish and Game Association  Built in 1986, the Cold Lake Fish Hatchery uses a “flow through” method where water is taken from Cold Lake, heated and treated, used during fish hatchery operations and then returned to Cold Lake. A recirculating aquaculture system will generate a positive return on investment through significantly reduced utility costs. Modernizing existing operating and mechanical systems will also help improve cost efficiency. Funding for this project includes $7 million from Environment and Parks for construction of the new recirculating aquaculture system and associated infrastructure and $3.3 million from Alberta Infrastructure for installation of a new oxygen generator and replacement of the hatchery’s water head box, metal roof and motor control systems. Including work already underway or completed earlier this year, investments totalling more than $50 million in Alberta’s four provincial fish hatcheries will expand and modernize operations to support a larger, more efficient and more disease-free fish stocking program. Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure we are benefiting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive. Quick facts  The Cold Lake Fish Hatchery produces about 840,000 trout per year, including rainbow, brown, tiger and brook trout, with a total fish weight of about 65,000 kilograms. It is also the province’s only walleye aquaculture facility. The Alberta government owns and operates four fish culture facilities: Cold Lake Fish Hatchery, Raven Creek Brood Trout Station, Allison Creek Brood Trout Station and Sam Livingston Fish Hatchery. The provincial fish stocking program stocks about 2.1 million trout per year into about 240 water bodies throughout Alberta. This project is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes:  	 $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal $200 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects $500 million in municipal infrastructure $1.5 billion for Keystone XL      Related information  Alberta’s Recovery Plan My Wild Alberta – fish stocking      Media inquiries                                               Jess Sinclair                                           587-873-5564 Press Secretary, Environment and Parks    "

Alberta’s government is honouring its commitment to end the focus on so-called “discovery” or “inquiry” learning by repealing the 2013 ministerial order on student learning and replacing it with one that will give students a foundation of literacy and numeracy and a knowledge of the rich and diverse history of Alberta and Canada. The new ministerial order emphasizes civic virtues, core knowledge, and outcomes students need to succeed in school and throughout life.  “This new ministerial order on student learning is a return to proven teaching methods that will set up Alberta’s students for rich personal and work lives. Moving forward, education will promote skills development and knowledge pursuit, equipping students to explore opportunities that will help them develop their talents and unleash their potential.” Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education  The new ministerial order was developed after the government broadened consultations to hear a wider range of perspectives from parents, teachers, and subject matter experts. It places an emphasis on essential core knowledge, evidence and fact-based materials, and focuses on literacy and numeracy as foundational elements woven throughout the entire curriculum.  “As a lifelong teacher, I fundamentally believe that students should gain the knowledge and skills they need to form foundations for successful and fulfilling lives. Literacy and numeracy are the bedrock for successful learning, and I am pleased that the final ministerial order recognizes that importance.” Angus McBeath, chair, Curriculum Advisory Panel  Now that the new ministerial order is in place, the 2018 draft K-4 curriculum will be reviewed and future curricula will be drafted for the next grades. All draft curricula will be aligned with the new vision. Due to delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, timelines for piloting the new draft curriculum are being adjusted. Validation will be expanded from K-4 to include Grades 5 and 6. Participating schools will start piloting this curriculum in classrooms in September 2021. At a minimum, a draft curriculum for Grades 7-10 will be ready for classroom validation in September 2022. It is anticipated that all students attending school in Alberta will be learning from the new K-6 curriculum by the 2022-23 school year. Quick facts  In August 2019, the independent 12-member Curriculum Advisory Panel was established. In December 2019, the panel submitted a draft ministerial order on student learning and recommendations on curriculum direction to government. In February 2020, more than 8,500 Albertans, including education partners, gave feedback on the draft ministerial order during a public engagement.

Joining the Minister for the announcement in Sundre were (L-R) Tracey McCrimmon with SPOG, Cam Linke with AMii and Dr. Soheil Asgarpour with PTAC.   Government is investing $10 million into three projects through the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) system which came into effect on Jan. 1, 2020. This includes allocating $3 million to the Sundre Petroleum Operators Group (SPOG) to test the viability of methane emissions reduction technology. Improvements could enhance the accuracy of finding methane emission leaks at a lower cost.  Government is also supporting the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) with a $5-million grant to develop artificial intelligence capabilities that could help companies identify emission reductions opportunities. Additionally, government is contributing $2 million to the Petroleum Technology Alliance of Canada (PTAC) to conduct applied research that could improve oil and gas sector methane emission management and control, while also reducing costs to industry. Alberta’s methane reduction target is to reduce methane emissions from upstream oil and gas operations by 45 per cent (relative to 2014 levels) by 2025.  “Last year, when we introduced TIER, we said we would help job creators reduce their emissions by making investments in technology and research. Today’s announcement is an example of that, and helps further our position as a global leader in technology-driven environmentally responsible development. These programs will help industry identify, track, measure and ultimately reduce emissions. They will also ensure we maintain our competitive edge while creating jobs and economic growth for Alberta.” Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks  SPOG – Methane Emissions Management Program The Methane Emission Management Program, developed by SPOG in partnership with a number of industry associations and individual operators, is a pilot program that will be deployed on about 500 facilities in the Sundre area. This area was selected due to the high density of sites, but innovative solutions will be shared with operators throughout the province.  “SPOG is a grassroots not-for-profit organization that has responded to the interests and concerns of the residents, landowners, and industry operators regarding energy resource development for almost 30 years. We are very excited to facilitate our Methane Emission Management Pilot that supports industry’s drive to reduce their environmental footprint in a cost-effective and collaborative approach. In partnership with our SPOG producer members, we are striving to test the latest available technologies in detection and provide science-based solutions for methane emissions.” Tracey McCrimmon, executive director, SPOG  AMii – Machine Intelligence Amii is delivering the Reducing Emissions through Machine Intelligence project to help Alberta companies identify key opportunities for emission reductions by providing technical advice. The aim of the project is to have Alberta businesses reduce their overall emissions and increase their knowledge and capabilities in the application of artificial intelligence for emissions reduction. Amii, which is one of Canada’s three artificial intelligence institutes and a global leader in the field, is currently working with companies from across the province and around the world to increase the productivity of our industries and attract investment to Alberta.  “We work with companies at all stages of technology adoption to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and build their internal AI capacity. We look forward to leveraging our resources, knowledge and community to advance the work of companies seeking to reduce emissions. The REMI project is an opportunity for Amii to contribute significantly to innovations that create a competitive advantage for companies that play a vital role in our province’s economic success.” Cam Linke, CEO, Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute  PTAC – Collaborative Research PTAC funding will be combined with almost $1 million from non-government funds. PTAC is a Calgary-based, non-profit organization established to facilitate innovation, technology transformation and collaborative research to support responsible development of Canada’s hydrocarbon energy resources. PTAC has worked with industry, the Alberta Energy Regulator and government to identify 10 research projects to support cost-effective oil and gas emission reductions. These highly technical and innovative projects range from improved understanding of methane leaks from abandoned wells to new measures to prevent future leaks at wells and facilities.  ""The TIER funds will allow PTAC to launch new projects to build on our previous work focused on methane leak detection, quantification, and repair. These projects exemplify the benefits of collaboration among the Government of Alberta, the Alberta Energy Regulator, and industry; they will also be aligned with our mutual objectives of finding cost-effective approaches to meet the 2025 methane emissions reduction target. In addition, these projects support smart policies and regulations, create clean tech jobs, and support red tape reduction."" Dr. Soheil Asgarpour, president, PTAC  TIER TIER is an improved way to manage emissions from large industries like oil sands operations and electricity producers, which account for about 65 per cent of Alberta's total greenhouse gas emissions. The system encourages industrial facilities to find innovative ways to reduce emissions and invest in clean technology to stay competitive. While TIER protects large industrial emitters and opted-in small oil and gas operators, regulated facilities can comply with the regulation by paying $30 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted. This is allocated to a TIER compliance fund which is then used to fund projects to reduce emissions.

Nous continuerons à travailler avec les exploitants de refuges et l’Alberta Health Services pour nous assurer que la population vulnérable est en santé et en sécurité. » Rajan Sawhney, ministre des Services sociaux et communautaires  Les refuges pour sans-abri offrent de l’hébergement essentiel et de courte durée aux personnes qui n’ont pas de logis, et ils sont souvent le premier point de contact pour les personnes à la recherche d'un abri. Le financement supplémentaire permettra de garantir que les lieux d'hébergement élargis mis en place pour répondre aux directives d'éloignement physique pourront continuer à fonctionner et qu’ils pourront offrir un accès 24 heures sur 24, 7 jours sur 7, aux endroits où cela est possible.  « Tout au long de cette pandémie, la Hope Mission a continué à soutenir les personnes qui ont franchi ses portes à la recherche d’un repas chaud et d’un endroit pour dormir. La COVID-19 nous oblige tous et toutes à faire les choses différemment pour assurer la sécurité de nos clients. Je suis heureux que le gouvernement apporte une aide financière supplémentaire afin que nous puissions continuer à soutenir les gens pendant cette période difficile. Au nom de la Hope Mission, je tiens à remercier le gouvernement de l'Alberta de s’engager à nous aider à nourrir et à abriter les plus vulnérables de notre ville. » Bruce Reith, directeur général de la Hope Mission  Sans un vaccin contre la COVID-19 et avec la possibilité d’une deuxième vague de contamination, ces services restent essentiels pour garantir que les personnes sans domicile fixe peuvent s'abriter, s'isoler et être soignées, en plus de recevoir le soutien sanitaire dont elles ont besoin.  « La COVID-19 continue de menacer sérieusement les personnes sans domicile fixe. Il est essentiel que nous continuions à travailler ensemble pour que les Albertains et les Albertaines sans abri soient protégés, qu’ils puissent s’isoler et obtenir des soins en toute sécurité ou encore qu’ils aient accès à un refuge d'urgence. Je suis heureux que le gouvernement s'efforce de faire en sorte que ces mesures de soutien puissent continuer d’exister. » Stephen Wile, PDG de Mustard Seed  Le plan de relance de l'Alberta est une stratégie à long terme audacieuse et ambitieuse qui vise à créer, à diversifier et à consolider des dizaines de milliers d'emplois, dès maintenant. La construction d’écoles, de routes et d'autres installations de base profite à nos collectivités. En diversifiant notre économie et en attirant des investissements grâce à l'environnement fiscal le plus concurrentiel au Canada, nous mettons l'Alberta sur la voie de la croissance. L'Alberta s'est unie pour sauver des vies en aplatissant la courbe et nous devons maintenant faire de même pour sauver nos moyens de subsistance, et pour croître et prospérer. En bref  Ce financement s'ajoute aux 25 millions de dollars annoncés en mars 2020. Ce financement garantit l’augmentation des places en refuge à Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer, Lethbridge, en plus du maintien de l’exploitation des centres de Grande Prairie, Lac La Biche, Lloydminster et Drayton Valley.

Alberta taxpayers are giving $17.27 million to Lakeland College to modernize the Mead Building, creating more student-centred and energy-efficient spaces. The Mead Building is home to the college’s animal science centre. These renovations will help ensure the college’s essential research and learning spaces continue to serve the region for years. The project will add about 97 new job opportunities for skilled contractors and tradespeople in east-central Alberta. Funding for this project is part of an additional $98-million commitment for capital maintenance and renewal at colleges, universities and polytechnics, on top of the $118.5 million in Budget 2020. Government expects the new funding commitment will create about 533 full-time jobs around the province.  “Alberta’s Recovery Plan is not only creating thousands of jobs by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure. It’s also helping train the skilled professionals and talented innovators our economy needs to grow in the future. Alberta’s government is determined to help people access the education and training they need to reach their full potential and persevere through these challenging times. That’s exactly why Alberta’s Recovery Plan is supporting post-secondary institutions with a historic level of funding for capital maintenance and renewal.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs, now. We are committed to developing world-class post-secondary institutions, and today’s announcement of over $17 million to redevelop the Vermilion campus at Lakeland College will help us meet students’ evolving needs.” Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education   “Alberta’s Recovery Plan focuses on infrastructure as a critical component for supporting economic growth and jobs for Albertans. This includes investing in shovel-ready projects to upgrade and maintain public facilities, like this post-secondary institution, that help keep Albertans working and stimulate local economies where it matters most.” Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure   “Lakeland College is a great asset for Vermilion and the surrounding region. The institution provides students the opportunity to live, learn and work in rural Alberta. Students today, like the ones at Lakeland College, are the workforce of Alberta’s tomorrow. Lakeland College has shown exceptional community leadership and, with the modernizing of the Mead Building, will continue to do so well into the future. I look forward to visiting with students and staff while enjoying the comfortable and productive space this revitalization provides.” Garth Rowswell, MLA for Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright   “On behalf of Lakeland College, thank you to the Alberta government for investing in our students – our province’s up-and-coming leaders – as well as our campus community. The 100 jobs this project will create is welcome news for our local region. This support opens another chapter of innovation and investment for Lakeland’s award-winning programs. Over the last four years, Lakeland has celebrated the expansion of the Vermilion campus farm and the upcoming addition of a bison operation, as well as the official opening of both a new animal health clinic and dairy learning centre, plus the modernization of our G.N. Sweet Livestock Research Facility and Academic Link. We’re excited to see our growth continue with the government’s investment in this teaching facility. This, combined with future farm upgrades and our new Centre for Ag Technology, will ensure Lakeland remains a global leader in agricultural education.” Alice Wainwright-Stewart, president and CEO, Lakeland College   “The Students’ Executive Council of Lakeland College thanks the Government of Alberta for their commitment of $17.3 million to Lakeland College to modernize the Mead Building, creating attractive, student-centred and energy-efficient spaces that will serve the region for many years to come. The Students’ Executive Council of Lakeland College supports this supplemental capital funding and remains committed to working with the government and Alberta Student Executive Council in building a sustainable post-secondary system in Alberta.” Carrie Boerrichter, general manager, Lakeland College Students’ Association   “The Alberta Students' Executive Council thanks the Government of Alberta for their commitment of $98 million from the Capital Maintenance and Renewal Stimulus Fund. This investment comes at an important time for Alberta's institutions and our economy, a fact well recognized by our university, college, and polytechnic student members. ASEC supports this supplemental capital funding, and remains committed to working with the government in building a modern post-secondary system in Alberta.” Emmanauel Barker, director, public relations and advocacy, Alberta Students' Executive Council  In April, the Alberta government announced it was accelerating the capital plan by increasing capital maintenance and renewal spending in 2020-21 to almost $2 billion. Advanced Education worked with post-secondary institutions to identify projects, with a focus on addressing existing maintenance issues, ensuring compliance with building codes and regulations, increasing access to services, and reducing operational costs. The Alberta government also prioritized projects that will help create jobs, and are ready for work to begin. Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure, we are benefiting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive.

Alberta’s Wildlife Regulation sets out rules about wildlife use, such as fees, licences, reporting requirements and hunting and trapping activities. The changes will give hunters and trappers clarity on rules, while also providing them with more opportunities to get outdoors and do what they love.  “These updates to the Wildlife Regulation are long overdue and provide countless conservation benefits that we will see for years to come. Hunting has always been a critical wildlife management tool in the province and we are reaffirming that here. As a hunter myself, I am also pleased that these amendments will allow hunters to spend more time outside and less time filing paperwork, in keeping with the Alberta government’s overall efforts to cut red tape.” Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks  The updated regulation will help improve wildlife conservation, eliminate outdated administrative requirements, reduce conflicts between wildlife and people, and protect important habitats for vulnerable wildlife. The changes also provide temporary economic relief to guide-outfitters due to border restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alberta resident hunters will be temporarily allowed to hold hunting licences and participate in guided hunts that are normally designated for non-resident hunters. Hunting is an increasingly popular activity in Alberta, especially as Albertans recreate closer to home. These amendments will further support this activity. Hunters and trappers play a key role in supporting wildlife management activities, such as monitoring wildlife populations and wildlife diseases. These changes are yet another example of the important ongoing relationship between hunting and conservation. The amendments take effect on Aug. 25 and will be incorporated in this year’s hunting and trapping guides.  “With COVID-19 fears and the looming uncertainty of the closure of Canada’s borders, 2020 continues to be a devastating year for Alberta’s outfitted hunting industry, so we are extremely thankful to the Government of Alberta for their support of our industry in our time of need. Alberta’s outfitting industry is an important contributor to Alberta’s tourism and the rural economies in remote communities throughout Alberta. The outfitting industry directly employs nearly 3,000 people, generates $116 million in labour income, and contributes over $328 million to Alberta’s economy. We are grateful to the Government of Alberta for their support to help our industry survive this unprecedented season. With these combined initiatives in place, we are optimistic that we can be a strong contributor to the province’s post-COVID economic rejuvenation.” Corey Jarvis, president, Alberta Professional Outfitters Society   “The streamlining of the regulations will reduce paperwork and increase opportunities for Albertans who want to undertake the challenge of harvesting their own wild game for the family dinner table. Hunters and those who benefit from a hunter’s harvest should be pleased with the changes.” Todd Zimmerling, president and CEO, Alberta Conservation Association   “The Alberta Fish and Game Association (AFGA) is encouraged by, and pleased to have been part of the stakeholder committee to assist in the development of many of these amendments to the wildlife regulations. The amendments include a number of positive changes to better address the control and management of chronic wasting disease (CWD), prohibit the use of drones for scouting, and increased clarity and responsiveness to adjust harvest – to name a few. The AFGA is supportive of the numerous amendments that will increase opportunities for Alberta hunters and trappers, while enhancing conservation in required areas.” Brian Dingreville, president, Alberta Fish and Game Association  Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure, we are benefiting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive. Quick facts Some highlights of the Wildlife Regulation amendments include:  Guide-outfitters will be able to register and report sheep harvests on behalf of their clients, creating a more efficient process for international hunters to register their rams. Reductions in administrative requirements for hunters, trappers and outfitters, like allowing hunting licences to also be used as an export permit. The Alberta Professional Outfitters Society will also be able to refund hunting allocation and use fees back to guide-outfitters that have been unable to use them. Changes to when waterfowl hunts open and the location of wildlife sanctuaries in order to protect vulnerable wildlife when required. Requiring hunters to report wildlife tracking collars and other devices used to monitor wildlife to ensure biologists can download data to further inform our knowledge of wildlife movements across the province. Many formerly restricted migratory game bird waterbodies are now open to waterfowl hunting due to increases in waterfowl populations, affording hunters increased access and opportunity to enjoy over-water hunts. Hunters will be allowed to bring a companion dog (pack dog) along with them in mountain area Wildlife Management Units during an open big game hunting season. The updated regulation designates Kimiwan Lake as a game bird sanctuary to prevent displacement and disturbance to at-risk trumpeter swans from migratory bird hunting activity. Penalties of up to $500 for feeding dangerous wildlife, such as wolves, bears, and cougars, in situations other than baiting for hunting. Removal of the timing restriction for hunters using off-highway vehicles (OHVs) in certain Wildlife Management Units. Extending seasons in some fur management zones while removing restrictions on sale of fur-bearing animals lawfully trapped.

This is part of an almost $2 billion investment into capital maintenance and renewal projects throughout the province that can be actioned quickly so we can keep companies operating and Albertans working.” Jason Kenney, Premier  The government capital maintenance and renewal projects in Hinton will create more than 50 construction jobs, supporting the local economy and maintaining provincial infrastructure.  “The Hinton Training Centre is a key piece of Alberta’s wildfire and forest management network and ensures that we have the personnel to manage our province’s resources. This investment will directly support our forestry experts that protect our communities and manage Alberta’s forests every day.” Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry  Capital maintenance and renewal investments like this one help to maintain the facilities where government programs and supports are administered and delivered to Albertans every day. This project invests in vital repairs like updating HVAC systems and replacing interior finishes to ensure our province’s infrastructure continues to provide value for Albertans.  “Forestry and tourism are huge economic drivers for our area, and maintaining the Hinton Training Centre supports both of those industries. This project provides good construction jobs to keep Albertans working and stimulates the local economy right here in Hinton, where it matters most.” Martin Long, MLA for West Yellowhead  Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now.

L to R: David Westwood of St. Mary River Irrigation District, Minister Hunter, Minister Dreeshen and Minister Panda announce funding for irrigation infrastructure improvements.  The grant is part of Alberta’s $10-million Irrigation Rehabilitation Program. This funding will ensure Alberta’s irrigation districts continue to improve water infrastructure that provides water for irrigation and agricultural operations, municipal use, recreation, wildlife and habitat enhancement.  “Crumbling infrastructure on the St. Mary River network highlights the importance of on-going maintenance and rehabilitation. Alberta’s government will continue to invest in irrigation to attract value-added food processors that will create full-time jobs and expand our economy.” Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry  Rehabilitation projects supported by these grants include lining unlined canals, converting canals to pipelines and more. Projects like these increase the water conveyance network’s efficiency, allowing more acres to be irrigated with the existing water allocation.  “Irrigation is essential to the lives and livelihoods of thousands of Albertans and the Alberta government is committed to support this important industry. This grant to St. Mary River Irrigation District will help ensure southern Albertans continue to have reliable domestic water, aquatic habitats and recreational areas.” Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction   “We appreciate the funding we’re receiving through the Irrigation Rehabilitation Program. St. Mary River Irrigation District supports a rich and varied abundance of crops, providing southern Alberta with a steady and vibrant economy even during these difficult times. This grant supports our ongoing work to deliver water more efficiently to our communities and proudly serve the farms, businesses and people in southern Alberta.” George Lohues, board chair, St. Mary River Irrigation District  Started in 1969, the Irrigation Rehabilitation Program is a long-standing grant program that provides cost-shared funds to irrigation districts to rehabilitate irrigation infrastructure. Government of Alberta investments through the program are matched by districts at a ratio of 75 per cent government to 25 per cent district.

The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods (SCAN) unit of the Alberta Sheriffs obtained a court order that took effect at noon on Aug. 4, authorizing them to close the house at 204 Cardiff Drive NW for 90 days. Under the terms of the community safety order granted by the court, crews boarded up the house, changed the locks and erected a fence around the property. The barriers will remain in place until Nov. 1. The homeowner, whose son lived at the property and allegedly had been renting it out to several tenants, will have access to the property to conduct repairs.  “We value the commitment the SCAN unit and its law enforcement partners have made toward keeping Albertans safe, secure and protected. Left unchecked, criminality can disrupt the peace within an entire otherwise law-abiding community. Thanks to the SCAN unit, a regular source of violence and disorder within this neighbourhood has now been shut down.” Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General  Multiple complaints from the community about drug use, drug trafficking and other criminal activity associated with the property prompted the SCAN investigation, which began in June 2019. Criminal activity at the property was also a concern for the Calgary Police Service (CPS), which attended the property on 32 different occasions between January 2018 and February 2020. These calls included weapon complaints, complaints of noise and other disturbances, and complaints of stolen vehicles. In June 2020, CPS responded to reports of multiple gunshots at the property that left bullet holes in a neighbouring house, and a person on the scene sustaining a bullet wound that required hospital treatment. During several days of surveillance, SCAN investigators observed multiple drug transactions and several people attending the property. Many residents at the property had extensive records for violence. On July 20, SCAN investigators obtained a community safety order. In addition to barring the homeowner’s son and multiple others from the property until Nov. 1, the court order places the property under supervision until July 20, 2021. The SCAN unit works with other law enforcement agencies to shut down properties being used for illegal activities. The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act gives sheriffs the authority to target problem properties through civil enforcement. Since its inception in 2008, Alberta’s SCAN unit has investigated more than 5,800 problem properties and issued more than 80 community safety orders. The majority of complaints are resolved by working with property owners to keep criminal activity out of the community.

While mandatory mask use is for students in Grades 4 to 12 and all staff, all students and staff in public, separate, Francophone, charter and independent schools will receive two reusable masks from Alberta’s government. More than 1.6 million masks will be distributed to 740,000 students and 90,000 staff. Additional single-use masks will be available at schools, if required. Mask use will be mandatory for staff and teachers in all settings where physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students will be required to wear them in all shared and common areas such as hallways and on buses. Exemptions will be made for students and staff who are unable to wear a mask due to medical or other needs. Mask use for kindergarten to Grade 3 students will continue to be optional. Mask use for younger children is a challenge due to difficulties with proper fit and compliance. In addition, evidence shows that children under 10 may be less likely than older children or adults to transmit COVID-19.  “The safety of our staff and students continues to be my number 1 priority. Since cancelling in-person classes in March and developing our school re-entry plan, we have been clear that we would continue to adapt our guidelines as necessary based on current medical advice. These new safety measures will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our schools, and we will continue to work with our school authorities to ensure they are equipped for a successful start to the school year.” Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education   “After reviewing the emerging evidence, it is clear that masks can play an important role in limiting the spread of COVID-19. I am not making this updated recommendation lightly, but acting on the best current evidence available. While masks are important, I want to stress that they are only one of the many public health measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of students, staff and families.” Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Alberta   “CASS’ board of directors appreciates the government’s commitment to adapting Alberta’s health guidelines as new medical information becomes available and for ensuring school divisions are receiving the protective equipment they need for a successful transition back to school. This announcement clearly demonstrates Alberta Education’s willingness to take the necessary steps to support the safety of staff and students. We appreciate their continued collaboration and support as we approach the beginning of a new school year.” Bevan Daverne, president, College of Alberta School Superintendents  Alberta’s government remains committed to adjusting the school re-entry guidelines based on current medical advice. The chief medical officer of health has been studying the evidence around masking in schools, and this decision is a direct result of evolving medical advice. Face shields School staff will receive one reusable face shield for their use in the schools. Shield use is at the discretion of the individual staff member. Plastic face shields can help reduce exposure but are not equivalent to masks. A mask must still be worn while wearing a face shield. Hand sanitizer About 466,000 litres of hand sanitizer will be distributed between all school authorities. The specific volume provided to an individual school authority will be based on student population. Thermometers Each school will receive two contactless thermometers to assist with managing student and staff health. Thermometer use will be at the discretion of the school authority. Staff testing Alberta Health and Alberta Health Services are working hard to expand testing capacity and reduce turnaround times for testing, including in-school staff, teachers and students, so that anyone with symptoms or close contacts of cases can be rapidly tested and receive test results promptly. All supplies will be distributed to school authorities by the beginning of the 2020-21 school year. Authorities will then distribute to individual schools, staff and/or students based on the needs of their own communities. Provincial health guidance for a safe return to school will continue to evolve as necessary to reflect the latest evidence on the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual school authorities are developing return-to-school plans that meet the needs of their own communities. These plans are based on direction provided under the provincial school re-entry plan, and supporting health guidance documents. Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure we are benefiting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive. Quick facts  Alberta’s government announced students and staff would return to school under scenario 1 – near-normal daily operations with health measures – on July 21. School authorities are required to be prepared to move between the three scenarios outlined in the provincial school re-entry plan. Changes to scenarios will be determined by Alberta Education.

As Stage Two of Alberta’s relaunch progresses, Alberta’s government has worked with numerous partners to ensure that as many Albertans as possible had the opportunity to get a small supply of masks. This distribution of non-medical masks was the first – and so far only – program of its type in Canada. By partnering with A&W, McDonald’s Canada, Tim Hortons and community partners like transit services, First Nations communities and Metis Settlements, places of worship and others, the Government of Alberta saved an estimated $35 million in packaging, shipping and distribution costs.  “I want to thank our corporate partners, A&W, McDonald’s Canada and Tim Hortons, for their tremendous support and contribution in making this program a success. Through this program, we helped kick-start individuals’ efforts to acquire masks as the supply chain caught up with demand. We want to thank all Albertans who took part in this program, and those who continue to do their civic duty by washing their hands, practising physical distancing, and wearing a mask when they can’t physically distance.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health  Distribution of masks through restaurant partners and the 211 services concluded on Aug. 2. Community and social service partners who have developed their own distribution timelines may still have masks available for their own residents, clients and service users. At this time, Alberta’s government has no plans to distribute more free masks. The program was intended to offer free non-medical masks to Albertans to supplement an individual’s own efforts to acquire their own supply of non-medical masks. Albertans who wish to use masks in situations where physical distancing is not possible are encouraged to support their local pharmacies, grocery stores, and hardware store when buying masks. Directions for making cloth masks are available at alberta.ca/masks. Quick facts  40 million non-medical masks were shared with Albertans. 26.1 million masks were handed out free of charge by program partners A&W, McDonald’s Canada and Tim Hortons at more than 700 of their restaurant locations provincewide in June and July. Five million masks were provided to 21 transit services in Alberta, including Calgary, Red Deer and Edmonton for distribution to their riders.  	 Free shipping and delivery of these masks to each transit service was provided by 7-Eleven Canada.   2.5 million masks were delivered to more than 1,000 places of worship in the province for use by members of their congregations. 2.6 million masks were provided to municipalities without easy access to partner restaurants, First Nations communities and Metis Settlements for distribution to their residents. 3.6 million masks were distributed to long-term care and seniors facilities, groups and organizations that support vulnerable Albertans, municipal and regional library boards, courthouses, and food banks. 200,000 masks were shipped directly to Albertans who could not access drive-thrus. Instructions for proper care and use of non-medical masks are available at alberta.ca/masks.

Quarante millions de masques non médicaux ont été distribués à la population albertaine dont plus de la moitié dans les restaurants A&W, McDonald’s du Canada et Tim Hortons. Au cours de la deuxième étape de la relance de l’Alberta, le gouvernement a travaillé avec de nombreux partenaires pour garantir qu’un maximum d’Albertains et d’Albertaines puisse se procurer quelques masques. À ce jour, ce premier programme de distribution de masques non médicaux demeure unique en son genre au Canada. En s’associant notamment à A&W, à McDonald’s du Canada, à Tim Hortons et à des partenaires communautaires comme les services de transport en commun, les communautés des Premières Nations et les établissements métis et les lieux de culte, le gouvernement de l’Alberta a économisé environ 35 millions de dollars en frais d’emballage, d’expédition et de distribution.  « Je tiens à remercier nos sociétés partenaires, A&W, McDonald’s du Canada et Tim Hortons, pour leur soutien et leur contribution exceptionnels à la réussite de ce programme. Grâce à ce programme, nous avons appuyé les efforts des particuliers pour obtenir des masques pendant la période d’adaptation de la chaîne d’approvisionnement à la demande. Nous tenons à remercier tous les Albertains et toutes les Albertaines qui ont participé à ce programme de même que ceux et celles qui continuent d’accomplir leur devoir civique en respectant les consignes de lavage des mains, d’éloignement physique et de port du masque, le cas échéant. » Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé  La distribution de masques dans les restaurants partenaires et les services d’Alberta 211 a pris fin le 2 août. Les partenaires des services communautaires et sociaux qui ont établi leurs propres calendriers de distribution ont peut-être encore des masques à offrir à leurs résidents, clients ou usagers. À l’heure actuelle, le gouvernement de l’Alberta ne prévoit pas de distribuer davantage de masques gratuits. Le programme visait à offrir des masques non médicaux gratuits à la population albertaine afin d’aider les particuliers à se procurer des masques non médicaux. Les Albertains et les Albertaines qui souhaitent porter des masques lorsqu’il n’est pas possible de respecter l’éloignement physique sont invités à en acheter dans leurs pharmacies, épiceries et quincailleries locales. Des instructions pour confectionner des masques en tissus sont disponibles à l’adresse suivante : alberta.ca/masks (en anglais seulement). En bref  Quarante millions de masques non médicaux ont été distribués à la population albertaine.

Cinq millions de masques ont été fournis à 21 services de transport en commun en Alberta, notamment à Calgary, à Red Deer et à Edmonton pour qu'ils les distribuent à leurs usagers.  	 L’expédition et la livraison gratuites de ces masques à chaque service de transport en commun ont été assurées par 7-Eleven Canada.   2,5 millions de masques ont été livrés dans plus de 1 000 lieux de culte dans la province pour être distribués aux membres de leurs congrégations. 2,6 millions de masques ont été fournis à des municipalités dans lesquelles il n’y a pas de restaurant partenaire, aux communautés des Premières Nations et aux établissements métis aux fins de distribution à leurs résidents. 3,6 millions de masques ont été distribués aux établissements de soins de longue durée et pour personnes âgées, aux groupes et aux organismes qui soutiennent les Albertains et les Albertaines vulnérables, aux commissions municipales et régionales de bibliothèques, aux palais de justice et aux banques alimentaires. 200 000 masques ont été distribués aux Albertains et aux Albertaines qui n’ont pas accès aux services à l’auto.

Today, Canadians remain as moved and motivated by him as we were four decades ago. “As a kid, I clearly remember looking up to Terry and being inspired by him. He inspired us all. That’s why his original dream to raise $22 million for cancer research – one dollar from every Canadian – has snowballed into more than $700 million raised through fun runs around the world. “Although COVID-19 may preclude large-scale community runs this year, we remain heartened by Terry himself, who said, ‘Anything is possible if you try.’ So, the Terry Fox Foundation is asking us to unite in spirit, not in person, and take part in virtual runs on our own time. “May Canadians take time today to run or walk – each as we are able – to honour the memory of this courageous young man and his dream to beat cancer.”  Media inquiries                                               Christine Myatt                                           780-446-2179 Deputy Director of Communications/Press Secretary, Office of the Premier    "

Funding has helped thousands of businesses safely open and hire and rehire staff since the program began accepting applications on June 29. In the first month of the program, almost 7,700 applications have been processed with more than 6,700 grants issued. Businesses, cooperatives and non-profits across sectors have received funding, with the majority of applications so far coming from job creators in the retail, personal services, accommodation and food services, and health-care and social assistance sectors.  “We are supporting the jobs that depend on the successful relaunch and recovery of Alberta’s small and medium-sized businesses – they are the backbone of our economy, and they support jobs Alberta families depend on. Our focus remains on ensuring a safe relaunch to get Albertans back to work and our economy back on track.” Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism  The Small and Medium Enterprise Relaunch Grant offers financial assistance to Alberta businesses, cooperatives and non-profit organizations with fewer than 500 employees that faced restrictions or closures from public health orders, and experienced a revenue loss of at least 50 per cent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Job creators that meet the program’s eligibility criteria can apply for up to $5,000 in funding, which can offset the costs they are facing as they reopen their doors. This includes the costs of implementing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as physical barriers, PPE and cleaning supplies, as well as rent, employee wages, replacing inventory and more. The program launched with a budget of up to $200 million. Application intake will remain open until Aug. 31, or for four weeks following the start of Stage Three of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy – whichever is later. Full program details, including eligibility criteria and how to apply, are outlined on the program web page. Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure we are benefitting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive.

The number of physicians in Alberta increased by 12 per cent from 2015 to 2019, while the population grew by six per cent. Alberta has more physicians per person than the national average, and more than British Columbia, Ontario or Quebec.  “This data confirms that we need new approaches to paying and working with doctors. We spend 15 per cent more per capita on physicians than the national average, but Albertans aren’t seeing better results, and we have the same shortages in smaller communities that we’ve seen for decades. The previous government increased spending by $1 billion a year, yet rural physician supply grew slower than in other provinces. We need to align compensation with patient care, and make sure doctors are practising where Albertans need them.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health  The number of new physicians in rural Alberta grew by 6.9 per cent from 2015 to 2019. This is well below the national average, including Quebec (7.5 per cent increase), Ontario (nine per cent increase), and British Columbia (13 per cent increase) – all with much lower spending. Alberta spends $5.4 billion a year on physicians, the highest level ever in the province and highest per capita of all provinces. This includes $81 million a year to support rural physician recruitment and retention through various programs. Changes have been made to protect access to rural health care, including abolishing the $60,000 cap on the Rural and Remote Northern Program (RRNP), making this the most generous incentive in the country.

Any pharmacy in the province that wants to participate and is able to meet the safety requirements can now offer testing to Albertans who have no symptoms and no known exposure to COVID-19. The expanded pharmacy testing follows the success of Alberta’s pilot program launched in June. An initial group of pilot pharmacies safely tested more than 10,300 Albertans, increasing testing capacity and helping support a safe relaunch. To date, almost 677,000 COVID-19 tests have been completed across the province.  “Our innovative pilot clearly showed that community pharmacies can safely provide more Albertans with easy access to testing. Alberta continues to expand its testing capacity and maintain one of the highest testing rates in the world. Strong COVID-19 testing is a key part of our relaunch strategy and will help us continue to protect Albertans from this virus in the days ahead.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health   “With cases on the rise in Alberta, we must all do our part in the fight against COVID-19. The actions we each take today will help protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities tomorrow. Testing helps us understand more about the spread of COVID-19 in Alberta.” Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health   “We are pleased to see Alberta Health expand the pharmacy-based COVID-19 testing program beyond the pilot.  Most of the pharmacist practitioners participating in the pilot have been screening individuals prior to entering the pharmacy and testing by appointment only. Therefore, we encourage those interested in receiving a COVID-19 test to contact their pharmacist in advance.” Margaret Wing, chief executive officer, Alberta Pharmacists’ Association   “As a trusted partner to Alberta Health, Alberta Blue Cross is pleased to help deliver this initiative to enable pharmacies to support the reopening of our province for Albertans. This is a great initiative to deliver testing to Albertans, in a medium that is both convenient and accessible. Alberta Blue Cross is committed to supporting Albertans as we navigate together through COVID-19, and we are pleased to support this program.” Mark Komlenic, chief executive officer, Alberta Blue Cross  Each pharmacy will adhere to strict protocols and has the specialized skills needed to protect patient safety. The pharmacy test is a throat swab, which is sent to Alberta Precision Labs for analysis. Albertans are encouraged to reach out to a participating pharmacy for more information about how to arrange a test. A list of participating pharmacies is available through Alberta Blue Cross. Testing is available to all Albertans, even if they don't have symptoms. Asymptomatic testing is particularly encouraged:  Before or after spending time with individuals who have a higher risk of serious health outcomes (e.g., anyone over 65 or with underlying medical conditions) Before or after travelling internationally, attending an event with recent travellers or hosting them. Before or after participating in activities or events that may have put you at a higher risk of exposure (e.g., a large gathering where physical distancing was not followed). For frontline workers who have regular interactions with Albertans, particularly those at higher risk of serious outcomes.  In addition to participating pharmacies, anyone who wants to get tested can continue to book an appointment online with the AHS assessment tool. Quick facts  Alberta has performed almost 677,000 tests on more than 566,000 Albertans. Strong testing data helps government and public health officials understand how our communities are affected by COVID-19 to make public health decisions. Only those who have no symptoms and no known exposure to COVID-19 can be tested at participating pharmacies. Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms or known exposure must complete the COVID-19 self-assessment or call Health Link 811.

Toute pharmacie de la province qui souhaite participer et qui est en mesure de satisfaire aux exigences de sécurité peut désormais proposer des tests de dépistage aux Albertains et aux Albertaines sans symptômes ni exposition connue à la COVID-19. L’élargissement des tests de dépistage aux pharmacies fait suite au succès du programme pilote de l’Alberta lancé en juin. Un premier groupe de pharmacies pilotes a fait subir des tests de dépistage en toute sécurité à plus de 10 300 Albertains et Albertaines pour permettre d’augmenter la capacité de dépistage et d’assurer la relance en toute sécurité. À ce jour, près de 677 000 tests de dépistage pour la COVID-19 ont été effectués dans la province.  « Notre projet pilote novateur a clairement montré que davantage d’Albertains et d’Albertaines peuvent accéder facilement à des tests de dépistage dans les pharmacies des collectivités. L’Alberta continue d’élargir sa capacité de dépistage et affiche toujours l’un des taux de dépistage les plus élevés au monde.

The award criteria was shaped in consultation with government, Veterans Affairs Canada, the Department of National Defence and veterans’ organizations.  “There is no higher form of public service than to risk one’s life in defence of our country or maintaining public safety. The sacrifices that members of the Canadian Armed Forces have made in protecting our communities is courageous and we recognize the value of the important work they do. The Alex Decoteau Award of Honour is one of the ways we can support those who have selflessly protected us each and every day and pursue post-secondary education.” Brad Rutherford, MLA for Leduc-Beaumont and liaison to the Canadian Armed Forces   “As a proud Canadian Army veteran and father of three university students, I welcome the provincial government’s decision to honour Alexander Decoteau – a distinguished Canadian soldier – with a scholarship fund for serving Canadian Armed Forces members and their families. This scholarship is a fitting tribute to the ultimate sacrifice Pte. Decoteau made while fighting for Canada in the First World War, a sacrifice that enables us to walk freely and enjoy our lives in this great province of ours more than 100 years later.” David S.

A new framework to manage oil and gas liabilities – which includes a series of mechanisms and requirements to improve and expedite reclamation efforts – will enable industry to better manage the clean up of oil and gas wells, pipelines and facilities at every step of the process, from exploration and licensing, through operations, reclamation and post-closure. Setting clear expectations throughout the life cycle of oil and gas projects will provide certainty to industry and landowners, who will now have a defined opportunity to ensure the timely cleanup of sites on their property. Taken together, the new framework will shrink the inventory of inactive and orphaned wells across the province, ensure more timely restoration of land to its original state, and protect future generations from experiencing a backlog of sites needing cleanup.  “Alberta has a world-class oil and gas sector that takes responsible resource development seriously. This new approach will further ensure everyone who benefits from development also addresses their ongoing reclamation responsibility in a way that is fair and achievable. By clarifying the rules and improving the process, industry can confidently make long-term investment decisions, which will help the province’s recovery efforts and create jobs, putting thousands of Albertans and Canadians back to work.” Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy   “I’m pleased this government is taking action where governments in the past have failed to do so. Farmers and other private landowners deserve a voice in the reclamation process, to ensure industry brings their land back towards its original condition – enhancing safety and their ability to repurpose their land. This is a positive step forward on an issue that is important to many Albertans.” Keith Wilson, QC, property rights lawyer   “The Metis Settlements have long been advocates for responsible resource development. That means ensuring the work of ‘cleaning  up’ is central to those operations. I am pleased to hear that Alberta will be taking the necessary steps to ensure that we not only practise responsible resource development but responsible reclamation. This work is critical to ensure our beautiful lands remain for future generations.” Roechelle Gaudet, vice-president, Metis Settlements General Council  The new framework, which will be implemented over the coming months:  Upholds the polluter-pay principle, ensuring that industry is responsible for cleanup costs in a way that is fair and manageable. Puts an improved system in place to assess the capabilities of oil and gas operators to meet their regulatory liabilities obligations, prior to receiving regulatory approvals. Provides practical guidance and proactive support for struggling operators, helping them to manage and maximize their assets, and maintain their operations. Doing so will protect Albertans from the financial and environmental burden of more inactive or orphaned sites – while ensuring operators meet their environmental responsibilities. Establishes five-year rolling spending targets for reclamation that every active site operator must meet. This initiative includes the AER’s area-based closure program, through which companies work together to share the cost of cleaning up multiple sites in an area. Establishes a formal opt-in mechanism for landowners to nominate sites for cleanup. These sites must then be reviewed by the regulator, with operators responsible for justifying why a site should not be immediately brought through closure stages. Implements a process to address legacy and post-closure sites – or sites that were abandoned, remediated or reclaimed before current standards were put in place, and sites that have received reclamation certificates and the operator’s liability period has lapsed. A panel will be established to consider how to address this gap, bringing these sites up-to-date with the current environmental requirements.  The growing inventory of orphaned and inactive wells is an issue across North America and the world, exacerbated in recent years by low commodity prices and the resulting economic downturn. Alberta’s current approach to govern the cleanup of these wells was put in place decades ago, when the oil and gas industry was largely focused on growing production and new infrastructure. As the province’s oil and gas sector has matured, a new approach is required to more actively manage reclamation of sites throughout their life cycle. This means working on the existing sites that require cleanup and keeping new sites from joining the inactive and orphan inventories in the future.  “From drilling through reclamation, it’s important that industry meets its obligations. Alberta’s Liability Management Framework will ensure oil and gas sites are cleaned up faster, reinforcing Alberta’s reputation as a leader in responsible energy development. The new framework provides clarity and certainty, which will help spur activity in the energy sector and put Albertans back to work when and where jobs are needed the most.”  Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks   “The new Alberta Liability Management Framework provides strong protections for Alberta to enhance the responsible reclamation of oil and gas sites, while ensuring responsible energy development can continue to produce high-paying jobs for Alberta workers and their families. This is an innovative and modern approach to ensure continued focus by companies on their responsibilities to local communities.” Tristan Goodman, president, The Explorers and Producers Association of Canada   “PSAC welcomes the introduction of Alberta’s new Liability Management Framework that will provide certainty to industry and investors while easing landowner and public concerns of a growing inventory. The new framework will also provide the oilfield services sector that PSAC represents with a predictable and regular stream of closure activity, sustaining jobs and retaining key skills and expertise. PSAC has long advocated for mechanisms for closure activity of orphan and inactive sites to create jobs while providing positive environmental outcomes that demonstrate our responsible resource development. Alberta’s new framework will uphold that trustworthy reputation.” Elizabeth Aquin, president and CEO, Petroleum Services Association of Canada  Quick facts:  Under the Liability Management Framework, the Alberta government sets the policy direction and provides oversight, while the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is responsible for administration – including monitoring progress, working with industry, and enforcement. As of July 2020, 456,729 licences have been issued to drill oil and gas wells in Alberta since the early 1900s. Currently, 96,969 wells are inactive, 70,785 are abandoned, 88,851 are reclamation certified, and 36,773 are reclamation exempt. Of the remaining wells, 162,530 are active and 821 have been drilled but are not producing.  	 Reclamation exempt sites are those that were reclaimed before the legal requirement for reclamation certificates came into effect. Abandoned sites are those that have been permanently plugged, cut and capped and left in a safe and secure condition, with surface reclamation work required before the closure process is completed and reclamation certificates may be issued.   The framework includes the expanded role of the Orphan Well Association set out in The Liabilities Management Statutes Amendment Act, which came into effect June 15, 2020, enabling the association to better manage and accelerate the cleanup of wells, infrastructure and pipelines that do not have a responsible owner.

Human trafficking is a dehumanizing and predatory crime that violates a person’s most basic human rights and dignity – and survivors of this crime are often the most vulnerable members of our communities. Traffickers exploit their victims, rob them of their freedom and coerce them into providing labour or sexual services, all for their own gain. We simply cannot allow this injustice to continue. Our government is taking action to combat human trafficking and build a province where people are safe and can perform the work of their choice free from coercion. Our nine-point Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking will protect at-risk individuals from being trafficked in Alberta, empower survivors of trafficking and provide new remedies to deal with traffickers. We’ve already put in place several tough new measures to better protect survivors and strengthen their ability to get away from physically, emotionally and financially damaging abuse. Through the Human Trafficking Task Force, we’re bringing together leading advocates and experts in addressing various forms of human trafficking to provide advice on how we can protect some of Alberta’s most vulnerable. We will not allow human trafficking to establish a foothold in our province, and we are committed to doing what it takes to eradicate human trafficking.” Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General   “World Day against Trafficking in Persons unites us with people across the globe in our efforts to end human trafficking. I am proud to work alongside Minister Schweitzer, the Human Trafficking Task Force, and our many partners in government and community to say: enough is enough. The majority of human trafficking survivors are young women who have had their freedom, security and control over their future stolen from them. Our government’s actions to protect at-risk individuals, empower survivors and penalize traffickers are important pieces of our commitment to ending violence against women and girls. We cannot stand by and allow this horrific crime to continue happening in our beautiful province. All Albertans must work together to shine a light on this darkness in this province, protect those at risk in our communities and bring an end to human trafficking.” Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women   “We must work together to make a difference in preventing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Our government is committed to empowering at-risk individuals and preventing exploitation, and we recently passed Alberta’s version of Clare’s Law to give those at risk of sexual and domestic violence an opportunity to gain information about an intimate partner’s violent past. We will continue to work with community partners, such as sexual assault centres, to provide counselling, support and advocacy to survivors.” Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services   “On World Day against Trafficking in Persons, it’s important for us to speak out loud and clear against those who would exploit and abuse others for their own personal gain and to support victims as we work toward eradicating human trafficking in all its forms. As Minister of Children’s Services, it is especially heartbreaking to know that a significant number of the victims of human trafficking are below the age of 18 and the vast majority are women and girls. In addition to being a horrific crime, it’s an affront to our values of freedom, safety and dignity of every person. The Alberta government’s actions have made progress in combatting human trafficking but there is more work to do, and this requires support from all of us – to raise awareness, to take action against offenders and to support victims.” Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services    Related information  Human Trafficking Action Plan    Multimedia  Watch: World Day against Trafficking in Persons video message     Media inquiries                                               Jonah Mozeson                                           587-985-6077 Senior press secretary and senior advisor, Alberta Justice and Solicitor General    "

The Dominion Bond Rating Service noted this spring that we rank first globally on environmental standards, and that our oil and gas sector accounts for about three-quarters of the $1.4 billion Canadian companies spend annually on clean technology investments. “Our long tradition of taking action on climate issues is backed by more than two decades of climate related programs and policies that paved the way for other jurisdictions. We are the first jurisdiction to place a price on carbon for all large emitters across all sectors. We have invested billions of dollars in technologies that reduce – or even eliminate – emissions, such as carbon capture and storage, and we have a regulatory framework that balances both the environment and the economy. “Canada – with the third largest oil reserves in the world – is perfectly positioned to continue to offer investment in a stable and ethical democracy. Our province and industry are bound by the rule of law, an adherence to human rights, gender equality and a strong, transparent regulatory system. “At the same time Total is dismissing the leadership of Canadian producers who are doing their part with active strategies that have reduced emissions, they continue to invest in countries such as Myanmar, Nigeria and Russia. This highly-hypocritical decision comes at a time where international energy companies should, in fact, be increasing their investment in Alberta, rather than arbitrarily abandoning a source of a stable, reliable, supply of energy.”  Media inquiries                                               Kavi Bal                                           780-818-2710 Press Secretary, Energy    "

This is excellent news for Canada’s energy sector, and hard-working people and families on both sides of the border who benefit from continued North American energy security and interdependence. “A major factor in our successful economic recovery is the continued success of our foundational oil and gas sector. And that success largely hinges on resolving the long-standing challenge of market access, driven by a lack of pipeline capacity. “While the construction of new pipelines – including Keystone XL, the Trans Mountain expansion project, and Enbridge Line 3 – is the only truly effective long-term solution, any and all initiatives that increase the volume of crude we transport internationally will aid our recovery. Increasing our ability to ship oil to key markets will help protect the value of our energy resources and attract new investment, in turn, creating jobs for hard-working Canadians. “Moving forward, there is no doubt that oil and gas will continue to dominate the energy supply mix for the next several decades. In fact, IHS Markit has just projected that oilsands production, led by Alberta, will reach 3.8 million barrels per day by 2030, almost 1.1 million barrels per day higher than today’s levels. “Furthermore, providing our American neighbours with more Canadian oil means they become less reliant on resources that come from countries that don’t share our commitment to social and environmentally responsible energy development. “As stated in Alberta’s Recovery Plan, the oil and gas industry will remain a pillar of our economy. At the same time we are also setting an unprecedented path toward a new, innovative and diversified energy future. This includes capitalizing on opportunities in the natural gas, hydrogen and petrochemical sectors, as well as emerging areas such as geothermal energy. “Our government is, and will continue to be, relentless in pursuing our goals of economic diversification, job creation and improving Alberta's financial well-being as we emerge from this economic crisis.""   Media inquiries                                               Kavi Bal                                           780-818-2710 Senior Press Secretary, Energy    "

At about 3:39 a.m., the 40-year-old man called 911 requesting an ambulance to a residence in Sherwood Park. The man told the dispatcher that he had been having hallucinations and had self-inflicted injuries, having stabbed himself in the neck multiple times. The man denied being suicidal and confirmed that the knives were still in his possession. An ambulance and police were both dispatched, as the man was potentially still armed or had access to weapons. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived on scene first and staged in the area to await the arrival of police. The plan was for police to enter first and ensure the scene was safe for the EMS response. This is a common practice when a person may be armed and/or have immediate access to weapons, and may be in the midst of a mental health breakdown. It was determined that officers would enter the residence first to assess the situation, and ensure the safety of the scene for EMS personnel. When officers approached the front door of the residence, a woman answered, but initially did not open the door. The officers identified themselves as police and informed the woman that someone in the basement had called for an ambulance, a fact she was unaware of. The officers urged the woman to open the door, and after a short time, she did. During a later interview, the woman confirmed that the man had called out to her from the basement and asked her to let the police into the residence. Once inside, three officers proceeded to the basement. They could hear a man talking but were unable to make out what he was saying. Upon entering the dark basement, the officers’ flashlights revealed the man standing at the end of a hallway. He was bleeding significantly from the neck, and holding what appeared to be a revolver in one hand, pointed toward the ground. It was communicated that the man had a gun and the officers transitioned to their service weapons. Two of the officers issued clear commands to drop the gun and stop, orders audible to the woman upstairs. The man did not respond to the officers’ directions and, after a brief moment, advanced on them, raising the gun in their direction. The officers repositioned to gain cover and distance themselves from the man, but when the man raised his firearm to what was described as almost chest level, the officers began discharging their service pistols, striking the man. Despite his injuries, the man continued to advance towards the officers with his gun raised. Officers again fired at the man until he fell to the ground. The man maintained control of the gun until he fell to the ground, when it fell slightly to his side. The man reached for his gun and one officer fired an additional shot in his general direction. This shot did not strike the man but caused him to move his hand away from the firearm. The only words the man uttered to police came following the shooting, when he indicated he could not roll over onto his stomach. He surrendered, was handcuffed and EMS was called into the residence to render aid. The man was treated and transported to hospital. Once at hospital, he received medical attention for gunshot wounds to his torso, groin and leg and an eight-centimetre self-inflicted laceration to the neck. Blood tests confirmed that the man was not under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances. After the incident, the weapon the man was holding was recovered and determined to be a Crosman 357 revolver-style pellet gun. A search of the basement bathroom of the residence revealed two knives, a bloody towel, and a handwritten note addressed to the woman in the home from the man. The note advised her that he did not wish to kill himself, but indicated that he had been having hallucinations for weeks.   A revolver-style pellet gun was seized from the man following the incident.  Under the Criminal Code, police officers are granted certain powers and authorities to facilitate the performance of what can be a challenging job. Under Sec. 25 of the Criminal Code, a police officer is authorized to use as much force as is reasonably necessary in administration of the law. This may include lethal force where an officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of anyone under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm. Further, under Sec. 34 of the Criminal Code, any person, including a police officer, is entitled to the use of reasonable force in defence of themselves or another person. In order for a police officer’s use of force not only to be authorized but protected, the officer must be acting in the lawful execution of his or her duties, often referred to as lawful placement. In this particular case, there is no question that all involved officers were acting in the lawful execution of their duties. All three subject officers were on duty, in full uniform, and were readily identifiable as police officers. The subject officers had responded to a 911 call at the affected person’s residence, and on the basis of the nature of the call and the information that was known to them at the time, were lawfully placed in their entrance to the affected person’s residence to assist the EMS call. Once inside the residence, the officers were confronted with what appeared to be an armed individual who was noncompliant with repeated verbal commands. When the affected person advanced on the officers and raised what appeared to be a handgun, the situation, both objectively and subjectively, gave rise to a fear of grievous bodily harm or death. In this situation, officers were dealing with an unknown person, whose intent they could not possibly predict with any certainty how far he might go, raising and pointing what appeared to be a firearm towards uniformed police officers who had directed and continued to direct him to drop the firearm. The man denied being suicidal, although there were signs to the contrary, but also indicated that he was suffering from hallucinations. The officers were not required nor expected to wait to determine whether the man would fire upon them first before they responded. Nor are officers required to use other potential interventions short of lethal force in the face of a threat that very clearly represents a lethal risk to their lives. If the person acting unlawfully objectively appears to be pointing a gun and to have the immediate ability to use it, officers are lawfully entitled to respond with lethal force. Once the firearm was removed from the affected person’s possession and he was handcuffed, there was no further use of force and emergency medical care was provided almost immediately. In considering all of the circumstances of this matter, it is the opinion of executive director Susan Hughson, Q.C. that the evidence does not provide reasonable grounds, nor even reasonable suspicion, to believe that any of the three officers committed a Criminal Code offence. ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently, and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

Dozens of industries like potato processing facilities and wood product facilities will now be eligible for exemption from the costly federal carbon tax because they can be regulated under TIER. Alberta’s government is giving more industries the same opportunity for protection from the federal carbon tax that other provinces and territories have.  “We’re refining the TIER regulation based on significant stakeholder feedback, which will make the regulatory process more cost-effective and put our industries on a level playing field with their peers without affecting emissions reductions. These updates will make more companies competitive in the long term and cut costs so that industries can reallocate savings into good-paying jobs for hardworking Albertans. This is another step in improving Alberta’s ability to compete in a global economy, building the right conditions for our province’s future prosperity.” Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks  The facilities that are now eligible for TIER will be able to achieve the same emissions they would under the federal system, but with the added benefit of cost savings. The updates build on the success of the TIER system, which is already saving regulated oil and gas facilities 90 per cent in costs in 2020 – or about $450 million – compared to what they would have paid under the federal carbon tax. Large industrial facilities are also saving more than $300 million annually under TIER compared to the previous provincial emissions regulations. TIER applies to large industrial emitters and opted-in facilities like small oil and gas operations, and will now include a wider range of sectors. It does not have a direct effect on Alberta households or the federal government’s decisions about the carbon price on families. The federal carbon tax continues to apply to fuel consumed outside of TIER facilities, pending the outcome of Alberta’s court challenge. Alberta successfully challenged the constitutionality of the federal government’s Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act in the Alberta Court of Appeal last December. The act remains in place, pending the completion of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada this fall. Quick facts  The updated TIER opt-in eligibility includes facilities under the 100,000-tonne threshold and those that belong to highly emissions-intensive sectors. Other updates to TIER include red tape reduction and administrative relief for conventional oil and gas facilities in recognition of challenges and delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is estimated that eight different industrial sectors will benefit from updates to TIER. About 100 small industrial facilities and about 20 medium-sized industries will become eligible for relief from the federal carbon tax. TIER helps industrial facilities, which account for more than 65 per cent of Alberta’s total emissions, find innovative ways to reduce emissions and invest in clean technology to save money and stay competitive. The TIER system is a unique solution that allows the province to reduce emissions and cut costs without interference from Ottawa.

The Commercial Vehicle Dimension and Weight Regulation specifies the legal size, weight and configuration limits for commercial vehicles on Alberta roads. The limits in the regulation have not been updated in decades and do not reflect modern vehicle configurations and equipment. As a result, commercial drivers in Alberta have to obtain permits for equipment that is allowed in most other jurisdictions, including trucks hauling multiple vehicles, mobile treatment centres, toter-homes, and wide-base single tires. Alberta Transportation routinely grants these permits for standard equipment, making them redundant. Updating the regulation means commercial carriers will no longer have to get permits for some standard equipment and practices.  “Cutting red tape and getting rid of barriers that keep Albertans from getting their jobs done is a fundamental part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan to create jobs and get Albertans back to work. We issue these permits virtually every time someone applies for them because the regulations include outdated vehicle weights and dimensions. Rather than making job creators apply for an outdated permit every time they need one, it makes more sense to simply update the regulations to reflect today’s truck configurations – and eliminate 10,000 permits in the process.” Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation   “This is another step Alberta’s government is taking to make it easier to do business in our province. By cutting red tape and updating this outdated regulation, we’re saving truckers and companies both time and money so they can stay focused on creating jobs and supporting our economy.” Grant Hunter, Minister of Red Tape Reduction   “Trucking is an essential service, and demand is growing as commerce shifts online. The safe and efficient movement of goods across our province is critical to Alberta's economic recovery. These changes reflect the types of innovation that are driving the future of the transportation industry. Ensuring regulations keep pace with advances in technology, training, and standard business practices makes the commercial trucking industry more resilient and more efficient.”  Chris Nash, president, Alberta Motor Transport Association   “We applaud the Alberta government for the reduction of red tape policies impacting carriers like Rosenau, who bring innovative solutions to lessen the environmental footprint while improving on-road safety and efficiency. These changes are welcome and deliver consistency between provincial and municipal roadways, creating an environment of effective trade corridors for the industry driving the Alberta economy.” Jude Groves, director, Safety & Training, Rosenau Transport   “Solutions like new generation wide-base single tires offer improved stability, safety, better miles per gallon (reduced green house gases) and fewer tires in our landfills.” Grant Mitchell, chief operating officer, Kenan Advantage Group (KAG) / Westcan Bulk Transport  Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and return investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada. Quick facts  By Jan. 1, 2021, more than 15,000 outdated provincial commercial carrier permits will have been eliminated to streamline processes and reduce costs for carriers while maintaining safety. Alberta is home to about 25,000 commercial carriers and 136,000 commercial vehicles. Transportation and warehousing contribute $11.2 billion annually to Alberta’s GDP and accounts for 5.4 per cent of the province’s jobs.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented economic collapse faced this year disrupted the normal legislative session, but Alberta’s government was still able to deliver on 93 more platform commitments while taking concrete measures to save lives and livelihoods. This means Alberta’s government has already kept or is well underway on 255 of 375 promises to Albertans. That’s 68 per cent of platform commitments made despite being only 31 per cent of the way through the four-year mandate.  “This year has been unlike anything our province has seen in more than a century. That’s why I’m so proud that when politicians across the country were at home, Alberta’s government was at work, delivering for Albertans. As Albertans work together to stop the spread of COVID-19, our government is working to get our economy back on track with Alberta’s Recovery Plan.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “The legislation passed this spring will help create jobs and get Albertans back to work. I’m also especially proud of the work we’ve done to protect our most vulnerable, including victims of human trafficking, sexual assault and other victims of crime.” Jason Nixon, Government House Leader  During the spring sitting, Alberta’s government passed 34 bills, keeping platform promises while taking action to protect the health and well-being of Albertans in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. To confront the unprecedented economic challenges  and stimulate economic growth in the province, the government also took action by introducing the largest-ever infrastructure program in Alberta’s history as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. Alberta’s MLAs returned to the chamber earlier than any other sitting jurisdiction in Canada to do their jobs and make life better for Albertans. Spring legislation highlights Bill 8, the Protecting Survivors of Human Trafficking Act, protects vulnerable Albertans at risk of being trafficked, strengthens survivors' ability to escape physically, emotionally and financially damaging abuse, and is a key part of government’s comprehensive action plan to fight the scourge of human trafficking. Bill 13, the Emergency Management Amendment Act (2), further refined the authority granted to local governments to manage emergency public health measures during the pandemic. Bill 15, the Choice in Education Act, expands the range of options available for parents and students to choose the schooling that works best for them – from charters to independents to home schooling to traditional Catholic and public schools. Bill 16, the Victims of Crime (Strengthening Public Safety) Amendment Act, preserves support for victims of crime while expanding the capacity of Alberta’s legal system to deter crime and prevent victimization. Bill 22, the Red Tape Reduction Implementation Act, will reduce and speed-up the regulatory process throughout government, encouraging investment, increasing Alberta’s competitiveness, and helping our economy recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and recession. Bill 26, the Constitutional Referendum Amendment Act, sets out the rules governing provincewide votes on a number of issues. Bill 28, the Vital Statistics (Protecting Albertans from Convicted Sex Offenders) Amendment Act, prevents convicted sex offenders from changing their names, limiting their ability to reoffend. Bill 31, the Environmental Protection Statutes Amendment Act, provides clarity and consistency for job creators in the sand and gravel industry while still maintaining stringent environmental protection regulations. Bill 32, the Restoring Balance in Alberta’s Workplaces Act, supports our economic recovery by providing employees and employers with clearer and more transparent rules promoting fairness and productivity. Bill 33, the Alberta Investment Attraction Act, also supports our economic recovery by enabling the creation of an arms-length corporation to attract job-creating private sector investment and promote Alberta as a prime investment location for businesses from across Canada and around the world. Motions passed in the chamber include: Government Motion 7, which called on the members of the legislative assembly to reject attempts by radical groups to block critical infrastructure in the province. Government Motion 20, which called on MLAs to stand against the federal government’s gun grab. Government Motion 24, which asked MLAs to condemn racism and bigotry in Alberta. Alberta’s Recovery Plan Albertans are facing one of the most challenging times in our history, hit by the triple threat of the largest public health crisis in a century, the biggest global economic contraction in almost a century and an unprecedented collapse in energy prices. The province came together to save lives and avoid large-scale shutdowns at the height of the pandemic – but the fight is not over. Just as Albertans must continue to remain vigilant and cautious, government will continue to work towards strengthening our recovery with Alberta’s Recovery Plan. Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure we are benefitting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive. Government has already announced more than $10 billion in infrastructure spending as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan, creating more than 50,000 jobs. This includes:  $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal $200 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects $500 million in municipal infrastructure $1.5 billion for Keystone XL  Other actions taken under the Alberta Recovery Plan to strengthen the economy include:  Accelerating the Job Creation Tax Cut (the lowest corporate tax in Canada) to ensure Alberta remains the best place for employer investment in Canada. Introducing the Innovation Employment Grant, a refundable tax credit targeted at smaller companies to encourage technology and investment in Alberta. Investing almost $28 million to create jobs and spur investment in the agriculture and agri-food industries. Helping connect unemployed Albertans with job creators and asking the federal government to remove most occupational categories under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program for Alberta. Launching the Invest Alberta Corporation to boost investment attraction efforts in key markets such as energy, agriculture, tourism, technology, aviation, aerospace and financial services with major partners around the globe.  Protecting Alberta from COVID-19 Some highlights of the actions government took to protect Alberta families and communities include:  Injecting more than half a billion dollars in the health-care system to ensure it can handle the demands presented by the pandemic. Passing a slate of legislation related to vital areas such as emergency management and deferrals on utility bills, education property taxes, student loans and government fees to protect the health and livelihoods of those affected by COVID-19. Achieving one of the highest per capita testing for COVID-19 in the world. Purchasing record amounts of personal protective equipment for health-care providers. Distributing 40 million free masks to Albertans throughout the province with the public mask program. Providing $53 million for additional mental health supports to help Albertans suffering from the mental and emotional impacts of the virus. Protecting laid-off workers with supports such as emergency isolation payments, banning rental evictions, deferring student loan payments and providing funding for caregivers of those who fell ill. Offering up to $200 million in small business relaunch grants for those who had to close. Deferring Workers’ Compensation Board premiums for private sector businesses to reduce the fiscal burden on job creators and ensure the sustainability of the compensation system for injured workers. Supporting families with $21 million for school nutrition programs, caregivers, food banks, donations and community initiatives. Protecting vulnerable seniors with $170 million for staffing and health-care aide wage increases. Enhancing manual contact tracing and early detection with the ABTraceTogether app to help alert Albertans more quickly if they are at risk. Launching the Alberta Biz Connect web page to help businesses meet public health and safety guidelines in general workplaces and specific industry sectors.

CL to R: Rancher and veterinarian Margitta Dziwenka, Minister Dreeshen and MLA Armstrong-Homeniuk announce changes to Alberta’s Meat Inspection Regulation.  These changes give operators more flexibility to meet legislated requirements and increase consumer access to high-quality local products.  “Alberta produces the world’s best beef, pork and poultry products, and Albertans want better access to these products. These common-sense changes will also provide new economic opportunities for Alberta ranchers and provincial abattoirs. Albertans value knowing where their food comes from and are proud to support local farm families.” Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry  These amendments modernize Alberta’s Meat Inspection Regulations and align us with our partners in other provinces.  “I’m glad to have worked alongside Minister Dreeshen to support our Alberta beef producers, ranchers, local farms and their families. These are well-thought-out changes that reduce red tape, maintain safety standards and open up additional business opportunities in this sector."" Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction   “We have consulted extensively with industry and been responsive to their input, supporting producers and providing more options to consumers while protecting animal welfare in Alberta. The changes make new tools available for meat inspectors, like video pre-slaughter inspections, and provide increased options for licensed slaughter for personal use.” Keith Lehman, chief provincial veterinarian  The changes come as a result of consultation with industry and other stakeholders and include:  Increased licensing options for personal use slaughter. Consumers can now buy an animal direct from the farm and have the animal slaughtered on-site for their personal consumption. Allowing provincially licensed meat facilities to salvage and sell meat by-products. As a result, abattoirs will be able to expand into markets that use meat by-products for human consumption, pet food and wildlife bait. Allowing for video pre-slaughter inspections in emergency situations. Abattoirs won’t have to wait for an appointed inspector to arrive in person on-farm to perform an inspection if animal welfare is at stake.   “Alberta beef producers have been asking for increased processing capabilities for several years and this is a positive step forward to address the issue. We would like to thank Minister Dreeshen for these changes that will give consumers another option to purchase Alberta beef.” Kelly Smith-Fraser, chair, Alberta Beef Producers and Pine Lake rancher   ""I applaud the amendments the government has made to the regulations, both as a veterinarian and a cow-calf producer. As a veterinarian, I feel that allowing video pre-slaughter inspections in emergency situations is a huge step forward for animal welfare. One of the changes I appreciate, in particular, as a cow/calf producer is the increased access to locally sourced meat products for consumers, while ensuring food safety."" Margitta Dziwenka, rancher and veterinarian  Since 1973, the Meat Inspection Regulation and the Meat Inspection Act have provided oversight for animal slaughter and meat processing in Alberta. The legislation also provides authority for abattoir and mobile butcher licensing.

L-R: Minister Madu, Minister McIver, Premier Kenney, Mayor Iveson, Tanya Thorn, vice president of the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association, and Al Kemmere. Calgary’s mayor, Naheed Nenshi, called into the news conference.  Alberta’s government is providing municipalities with $500 million in additional funding to build shovel-ready infrastructure projects starting in 2020, creating thousands of jobs as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. In addition, Alberta will match $233 million in federal funding to support municipal operating costs during the pandemic and $70 million to support public transit operating costs – for a total of $606 million under the Safe Restart Agreement.  “The past five months have been tough for Albertans as we faced the global coronavirus recession, the unprecedented collapse of energy prices, and the COVID-19 pandemic. But Albertans are resilient, and Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold plan to build, diversify, and create jobs. This investment will provide municipalities with the funding they need to get through this crisis, create good jobs now, and build the infrastructure that will fuel economic growth in our province for generations to come.” Jason Kenney, Premier  The $500-million municipal stimulus program, which boosts municipal infrastructure funding by almost 30 per cent, will create an estimated 2,500 jobs from projects that will begin construction in 2020 or 2021. Municipalities and Metis Settlements may begin applying for funding to build roads, bridges, water and wastewater treatment plants, and other important infrastructure that would not have been built in 2020 or 2021 without the stimulus.  “Alberta’s communities play a critical role in our economy and we want to help them get shovel-ready projects into the ground immediately to create jobs, drive economic growth and improve Alberta’s competitive position. We’re also asking municipalities to reduce taxes and red tape to make it easier to start up a new business, speed up approvals for development permits and make their municipality a better place to invest. Together, we’ll continue to make Alberta the best place to live and do business in North America.” Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs   “Alberta’s government is investing in roads, bridges, water and wastewater infrastructure that Albertans want and need, diversifying our economy and creating thousands of jobs in the process. I look forward to working with our municipal partners to build worthwhile projects that help develop and grow new economic sectors, and create much-needed jobs today.” Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation  Even before the municipal stimulus program, Alberta had committed $1.85 billion in Budget 2020 for municipalities including the Municipal Sustainability Initiative (MSI) and $244 million from the federal government’s Gas Tax Fund.  “The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have forced Alberta’s municipalities into a position where we need operating assistance for the first time ever. This partnership will not only allow us to meet our immediate operating concerns, but will also create jobs while providing needed infrastructure within our city. When we say, ‘we’re all in this together,’ this announcement is proof that it’s more than just words.” Naheed Nenshi, mayor, City of Calgary   “As COVID-19 has created many economic challenges in our society, this announcement is a great demonstration of partnership between all levels of government and will go a long way to help stimulate the Alberta economy. This will also create an opportunity to address the infrastructure needs and increased operating costs in our rural municipalities, as well as provide much-needed jobs for our residents.” Al Kemmere, president, Rural Municipalities of Alberta   “This is welcome news for our economic recovery efforts. We are grateful that the Government of Canada and the province heard our pleas for financial relief and understand the key role municipalities play in keeping essential services going during this time of crisis.” Don Iveson, mayor, City of Edmonton   “Supporting municipalities during this time of financial difficulty is critical to the successful relaunch of the Alberta economy. AUMA is pleased with the commitment of new funding over and above previously announced provincial support. We are encouraged the government recognizes the challenges municipalities face and the need for operational support from the province to ensure municipal services are maintained and municipalities are well-positioned to help lead Alberta’s economic recovery.” Barry Morishita, president, Alberta Urban Municipalities Association  Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure we are benefitting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive.

Albertans with hepatitis C need immediate access to services specific to their needs. This successful program provides Albertans with timely and effective treatment that supports their recovery.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health  The hepatitis C support program was established in 2005 and has supported more than 1,700 Albertans. The program provides a comprehensive range of health services, offering faster access to services and improved care, helping more Albertans achieve a full recovery.  “Hepatitis C continues to be prevalent in Alberta and Canada. As health-care professionals, we need to be alert to its presence. Our clinic has a long history of educating patients and professionals alike and an equally long history in therapy. Continuing education is of crucial importance to identify and treat these infected patients. Once diagnosed, therapy is simple and very effective.” Dr. Robert Bailey, gastroenterologist, G.I. Medical Research Associates  The program is also helping more Albertans fully recover from hepatitis C. With the program’s treatment and support, more than 90 per cent of patients achieve a full recovery. Quick facts  GI Medical Research Associates will receive the grant funding over about three years to continue to provide the hepatitis C support program. The program provides comprehensive health services to newly diagnosed and follow-up patients. The multi-disciplinary team at GI Medical Research Associates focuses on testing, treatment, education, counselling and other specialized care required by those diagnosed with hepatitis C. About seven out of 1,000 Canadians have hepatitis C and many do not know they have it. Hepatitis C is spread through blood-to-blood contact, which means that to contract hepatitis C, blood infected with the hepatitis C virus must enter the person’s bloodstream. The virus infects the liver and, if untreated, can cause cirrhosis, liver cancer or liver failure.

As noted in the report, doing so will create tens of thousands of jobs across our country, help lower global emissions, and increase Canada’s annual gross domestic product by tens of billions of dollars. This is why it is imperative that the federal government work with Alberta, British Columbia, and other provinces to advance LNG projects using a Team Canada approach. “As traditional natural gas export markets in the United States become increasingly self-sufficient, we must look towards new and emerging markets to ensure the long-term viability of the sector. As more countries, particularly in Asia, turn to cleaner forms of energy to displace coal-fired generation, Alberta’s 300-year supply of natural gas resources and technically skilled workforce make our province perfectly suited to supply this growing demand. “Since Day 1, our government has been steadfast in our support of Alberta’s natural gas sector. Albertans, Canadians and people around the world depend on this cleaner burning resource, and that’s why we continue to advocate – to all levels of government – for enhanced market access. Nation-building projects, such as those referenced in the report, would create more than 96,000 annual jobs for Canadians, and boost total wages by more than $6 billion each year. In Alberta, the completion of a series of West Coast LNG projects could contribute $1.6 billion to the province’s annual GDP, along with nearly 10,000 permanent, good-paying jobs each year. The report also notes significant job and economic benefits to other provinces across the country, including Ontario and Quebec. “We continue to work with our federal and provincial counterparts, industry partners, and Indigenous communities to identify critical long-term initiatives that will help cut red tape on project approvals, increase pipeline access, and get new and innovative infrastructure built to reach Canada’s coastlines. “As part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan, our government will soon announce details of our natural gas vision and strategy – a plan that outlines how Alberta will act on the significant LNG opportunity that exists for our province, as well as supporting sectors like petrochemical manufacturing and plastics recycling. “Our historical strengths as a natural gas powerhouse have set a solid foundation. Now, together as Team Canada, we must work to build an innovative and sustainable LNG industry that will create ripple effects of success well into our future.”   Related information  A Rising Tide: Economic Impacts of LNG in Canada     Media inquiries                                               Samantha Peck                                           780-644-9461 Press Secretary, Natural Gas and Electricity     "

While the armistice agreement has secured peace ever since, the war has technically never ended.  “More than 7,000 Canadians, as part of a 16-nation United Nations force, fought to defend the southern Republic of Korea after its invasion by the communist north. Canadians sent ships and aircraft, and provided jet pilots to the United States Air Force. Canada also fought in many ground battles, and patrolled tirelessly, often in horrendous conditions. It was Canada’s bloodiest conflict since the two world wars; of more than 26,000 Canadian men and women who served in Korea, more than 500 made the ultimate sacrifice, and more than 1,200 were wounded. “Today, the Republic of Korea is a prosperous and democratic nation and a great friend of Canada.

At about 6:13 p.m. on July 21, Strathcona County Emergency Services were dispatched to a report of a fire inside a suite of the Emerald Hills apartments in Sherwood Park. Emergency Services personnel attended and attempted to reach the resident of the suite, the 58-year-old man, but were unable to contact him. A second call for service in relation to the man was received at about 7:25 p.m., when police were dispatched to a Starbucks location in response to a report of a disturbance involving the man, who was in an intoxicated state. Police responded to the Starbucks. No arrest was made at that time. Shortly thereafter, the man returned to his apartment building and attempted to gain entry into his suite. Building staff and a fire marshal informed him that he could not enter the suite due to the amount of smoke in the unit, and a confrontation occurred. Police were called and it was reported that the man had physically assaulted the fire marshal. At about 7:54 p.m., police were dispatched again, this time in response to the reported assault. One member of the Strathcona County RCMP attended to the apartment building, observed the man outside the building and attempted to place him under arrest. While taking physical custody of the man, the officer took him to the ground, at which time the man’s head struck the ground, resulting in a laceration and bleeding. Police tended to the man and placed him in the recovery position until EMS arrived. The man was transported to hospital, where he was examined to ensure that he had not sustained any serious head injury, treated for the minor head laceration, and released about 12 hours later. ASIRT’s investigation will examine the conduct of police during this incident, while the RCMP will maintain responsibility for the investigation into the man and his actions. With ASIRT’s investigation underway, no further information will be released at this time. ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

Under a renegotiated bilateral agreement with the federal government, the Alberta government will receive $45 million to assist in the delivery of affordable and accessible child care.  “High-quality early learning experiences are essential to the intellectual, emotional and physical development of our children. Our government is pleased to continue working with the Government of Alberta to ensure that all children and families in Alberta have equal access to the quality early learning and child care they need to succeed.” Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, Government of Canada   “Accessible, affordable, high-quality child care is an important part of our economic recovery. This investment will ensure tens of thousands of parents, especially women and single parents, can enter the workforce while also supporting parent choice and parents’ diverse needs. We thank the federal government for working with us to invest in Alberta’s working parents.” Rebecca Schulz, Minister of Children’s Services  The funding for the three key priorities includes:  $29 million for affordability – Supporting low-to-middle-income families through higher child care subsidies.  	 A simplified formula and renewed investment in child care subsidy will result in 16,000 lower-income families paying an average of $25 per day for child care compared with about 7,500 families of all incomes paying $25 per day in the former pilot project. Parents of more than 24,500 children will see their subsidy support increase by 18 per cent and parents of another 3,500 will also see subsidy increases.   $9.7 million for accessibility – Meeting the diverse needs of parents and children across the province.  	 The new Inclusive Child Care program will expand on the pilot to provide child care operators access to coaching, professional development, and funding for additional staff to support children who have complex needs. Providing programming that address cultural and linguistic needs, such as Indigenous and Francophone programs. Creating up to 385 spaces this year in communities with high need and working with operators, communities, and parents on innovative solutions for parents who work outside typical business hours.   $4.7 million for quality – Supporting childhood learning and development with high-quality programming and training.  	 The Flight curriculum, a framework that helps guide early learning and child care educators for young children, will be made available online to all child care centres. Supporting ongoing professional development to ensure Alberta has a well-trained and highly skilled early childhood workforce.     “This new approach to child care will provide fair access to child care for all Alberta parents and it will make child care more affordable to parents who need it the most. It takes the best elements of the previous pilot program – the supports for inclusivity and the Flight curriculum – and expands them across the whole province. I’m looking forward to seeing how this plan will help parents across our programs in the future.” Korrie-Mae Wiszniak, chief executive officer, Kids@ Churchill Park, Calgary   ""The child care subsidy will help us go back to work while providing our child with quality care. It would also mean a lot for us to receive an increase to our subsidy as it would help us provide for our family during these tough times."" Ramavartheni Kanthappan, Edmonton parent  With a renewed focus on affordability for those who need it most, the federally funded ELCC Centre pilot program will come to its natural conclusion in March 2021. Phase 1 ELCC Centres (provincially funded) will receive funding until July 31. Preschools have historically been left out of the spectrum of parental choice in child care. Children’s Services is working with preschool operators and the Minister’s child care working group to recognize the importance of preschools for parents who work part-time or work from home. COVID-19 response The renewed bilateral agreement also includes $10 million carried over from the previous agreement to be rolled into Phase 3 of Alberta’s child care relief funding that will go to support child care, out-of-school care, and preschools. Combined with the $19 million the Government of Alberta has already committed in child care relief, total funding support will be almost $30 million. More information and supports are available on the child care during COVID-19 page. Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure we are benefitting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive. Key facts  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 109,000 children were enrolled in a licensed or approved child care space in a centre or a day home. Prior to the pandemic, about 80 per cent of licensed spaces in Alberta were filled. There are more than 2,900 active licensed/approved programs in Alberta. In a typical year, more than 28,000 children, or 26 per cent of all children in licensed child care centres and approved family day homes, are supported through child care subsidy – more than 80 per cent (about 23,000) of whom are on full subsidy. Those 23,000 families who are in the greatest financial need will now pay an average of $13 per day for full-time daycare.  	 When calculated with pre-COVID enrolment and centre fees data, about 16,000 families will be paying $25 per day or less.     Child care subsidy can be accessed by families with an income of up to $75,000, which is the most generous level in the country. Currently, 36 per cent of child care facilities are unable to care for children with disabilities without access to extra support, so these children are often excluded from child care programs after short trial periods. The subsidy formula changes will come into effect Aug. 1, and parents will be able to use the new easily accessible application website to determine their eligibility. Consultation feedback on the Child Care Licensing Act and regulations is currently being reviewed. Led by MLA Tracy Allard, these consultations have been gathering feedback from early childhood educators and parents in order to improve legislation and regulations in the fall.  Summary of child care benefits In addition to child care subsidy, Alberta families may be eligible for the Alberta Child and Family Benefit and other government benefit programs accessed through tax filings. While each family’s exact income and tax situation are different, as an example, a family with a single parent with one toddler would be eligible for these subsidy and tax benefit amounts, at different income levels.

Notre gouvernement est heureux de continuer à travailler avec le gouvernement de l’Alberta pour s’assurer que tous les enfants et toutes les familles de l’Alberta ont un accès égal à l’apprentissage précoce et aux services de garde de qualité dont ils ont besoin pour réussir. » Ahmed Hussen, ministre de la Famille, des Enfants et du Développement social, gouvernement du Canada   « Des services de garde d’enfants accessibles, abordables et de qualité constituent un élément important de notre reprise économique. Cet investissement permettra à des dizaines de milliers de parents, en particulier les femmes et les parents en situation de monoparentalité, d’entrer sur le marché du travail, tout en appuyant le choix des parents et en répondant à leurs besoins. Nous remercions le gouvernement fédéral d’avoir travaillé avec nous pour investir dans les parents qui travaillent en Alberta. » Rebecca Schulz, ministre des Services à l’enfance  Le financement des trois priorités clés comprend :  Un montant de 29 millions de dollars pour l’accessibilité financière – Soutien aux familles à revenu faible ou moyen par l’augmentation des subventions pour la garde d’enfants  	 Grâce à une formule simplifiée et à un investissement renouvelé dans les subventions pour la garde d’enfants, 16 000 familles à faible revenu paieront en moyenne 25 $ par jour pour la garde d’enfants, contre environ 7 500 familles, tous revenus confondus, qui payaient 25 $ par jour dans le cadre de l’ancien projet pilote. Les parents de plus de 24 500 enfants verront leur subvention augmenter de 18 %, et les parents de 3 500 autres enfants verront également leur subvention augmenter.   Un montant de 9,7 millions de dollars pour l’accessibilité – Répondre aux divers besoins des parents et des enfants à l’échelle de la province  	 Le nouveau programme de garde d’enfants inclusif élargira le projet pilote afin de permettre aux exploitants de services de garde d’enfants d’avoir accès à un encadrement, à un perfectionnement professionnel et au financement de personnel supplémentaire pour soutenir les enfants qui ont des besoins complexes. Offrir des programmes qui répondent aux besoins culturels et linguistiques, tels que les programmes autochtones et francophones. Créer jusqu’à 385 places cette année dans les communautés ayant des besoins élevés, et travailler avec les opérateurs, les communautés et les parents sur des solutions innovantes pour les parents qui travaillent en dehors des heures de bureau habituelles.   Un montant de 4,7 millions de dollars pour la qualité – Soutenir l’apprentissage et le développement des enfants grâce à une programmation et une formation de haute qualité.  	 Le programme d’études Flight, un cadre qui aide à guider les éducateurs de jeunes enfants, sera mis en ligne dans tous les centres de garde d’enfants. Soutenir le développement professionnel continu afin de s’assurer que l’Alberta dispose d’une main-d’œuvre bien formée et hautement qualifiée dans le domaine de la petite enfance.     « Cette nouvelle approche en matière de garde d’enfants permettra un accès équitable à la garde d’enfants pour tous les parents albertains, et elle rendra la garde d’enfants plus abordable pour les parents qui en ont le plus besoin. Elle reprend les meilleurs éléments du programme pilote précédent – les mécanismes de soutien à l’inclusion et le programme d’études Flight – et les étend à l’ensemble de la province. J’ai hâte de voir comment ce plan aidera les parents dans l’ensemble de nos programmes à l’avenir. » Korrie-Mae Wiszniak, directrice générale, Kids@ Churchill Park, Calgary   « La subvention pour la garde d’enfants nous aidera à retourner au travail tout en offrant à notre enfant des soins de qualité. Nous aimerons bien voir notre subvention augmenter, car cela nous aiderait à subvenir aux besoins de notre famille en ces temps difficiles. » Ramavartheni Kanthappan, parent d’Edmonton  Avec un accent renouvelé sur l’accessibilité financière pour ceux qui en ont le plus besoin, le programme pilote des centres d’accueil et de soins pour enfants, financé par le gouvernement fédéral, arrivera à sa conclusion naturelle en mars 2021. La phase 1 des centres d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants (financés par les provinces) recevra un financement jusqu’au 31 juillet. Les établissements préscolaires ont historiquement été laissés en dehors du spectre de choix des parents en matière de garde d’enfants. Les services de l’enfance travaillent avec les opérateurs de centres préscolaires et le groupe de travail de la ministre sur les services de garde d’enfants afin de souligner l’importance des centres préscolaires pour les parents qui travaillent à temps partiel ou à domicile. Réponse à la COVID-19 L’accord bilatéral renouvelé comprend également 10 millions de dollars reportés de l’accord précédent, qui seront intégrés à la phase 3 du financement de l’aide à la garde d’enfants de l’Alberta, afin de soutenir les services de garde d’enfants, les services extrascolaires et les établissements préscolaires. Combiné aux 19 millions de dollars que le gouvernement de l’Alberta a déjà consacrés à l’aide aux services de garde d’enfants, le soutien financier total s’élèvera à près de 30 millions de dollars. De plus amples renseignements et mécanismes de soutien sont disponibles sur la page des services de garde d’enfants pendant la COVID-19. Le plan de relance de l’Alberta est une stratégie à long terme audacieuse et ambitieuse qui vise à créer et à diversifier des dizaines de milliers d’emplois dès maintenant. En construisant des écoles, des routes et d’autres infrastructures de base, nous profitons à nos collectivités. En diversifiant notre économie et en attirant des investissements grâce à la fiscalité la plus concurrentielle du Canada, l’Alberta ouvre la voie à la croissance. Nous avons conjugué nos efforts pour sauver des vies en aplatissant la courbe. Nous devons maintenant faire de même pour sauver nos moyens de subsistance et assurer notre croissance et notre prospérité. Faits importants  Avant la pandémie de COVID-19, 109 000 familles étaient inscrites à un service de garde d’enfants agréé ou autorisé dans un centre ou en milieu familial. Cela représente 30 % des familles avec enfants de l’Alberta. Avant la pandémie, environ 80 % des places autorisées en Alberta étaient comblées. La province compte plus de 2 900 programmes actifs autorisés/approuvés. Au cours d’une année type, plus de 28 000 enfants, soit 26 % de tous les enfants des garderies agréées et des services de garde en milieu familial agréés, bénéficient d’une subvention pour frais de garde d’enfants – et plus de 80 % (environ 23 000) bénéficient d’une subvention couvrant l’intégralité des frais. Ces 23 000 familles, qui ont le plus besoin d’une aide financière, débourseront désormais en moyenne 13 $ par jour pour une garderie à temps plein.  	 Selon les calculs effectués en fonction des données sur les inscriptions et les frais des centres de garde avant la COVID-19, environ 16 000 familles débourseront 25 $ par jour ou moins.   La subvention pour la garde d’enfants est accessible aux familles qui gagnent un revenu maximal de 75 000 $, ce qui est le seuil le plus généreux à l’échelle du pays. À l’heure actuelle, 36 % des services de garde d’enfants ne sont pas en mesure de prendre en charge les enfants ayant un handicap sans avoir accès à une aide supplémentaire, de sorte que ces enfants se retrouvent souvent exclus des programmes de garde d’enfants après de courtes périodes d’essai. Les modifications apportées à la formule de subvention entreront en vigueur le 1er août, et les parents pourront visiter le nouveau site Web convivial pour les demandes de subvention en vue de déterminer leur admissibilité. La rétroaction obtenue lors des consultations au sujet de la loi sur l’agrément des services de garde d’enfants (Child Care Licensing Act) et des règlements y afférents est en cours de révision. Dirigées par la députée Tracy Allard, ces consultations ont permis de recueillir des commentaires auprès de parents et d’éducateurs de la petite enfance afin d’apporter des améliorations à la loi et aux règlements à l’automne.  Résumé des prestations pour la garde d’enfants Outre la subvention pour la garde d’enfants, les familles de l’Alberta peuvent être admissibles à l’allocation pour enfants et familles de l’Alberta (Alberta Child and Family Benefit) ainsi qu’à d’autres programmes de prestation du gouvernement accessibles par le biais des déclarations de revenus. Bien que le revenu et la situation fiscale de chaque famille soient différents, en guise d’exemple, une famille monoparentale avec un enfant en bas âge serait admissible à une subvention et à des prestations, selon ses revenus.

The funding will allow Keyano College to reroute data wires, while also ensuring the entire Fort McMurray campus is in compliance with building and safety codes. Keyano College employs hundreds of staff members and serves thousands of students. This project will ensure the college can continue to offer a safe and high-quality campus experience. Work is ready to start and will create about 18 full-time jobs in the community. Funding for this project is part of an additional $98-million commitment to post-secondary institutions for accelerated capital maintenance and renewal, which is expected to create about 533 full-time jobs around the province. This work will help improve all campus facilities while also giving Albertans consistent, well-paying jobs – a key government priority under Alberta’s Recovery Plan.  “Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs, now. With this funding we’re protecting and improving the things that make a difference in the lives of Albertans, and we’re setting students up for success by ensuring they have access to first-rate facilities and the training they need to find a well-paying career.” Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education   “Alberta’s Recovery Plan focuses on infrastructure as a critical component for supporting economic growth and jobs for Albertans. This includes investing in shovel-ready projects to upgrade and maintain public facilities, like this post-secondary institution, that help keep Albertans working and stimulate local economies where it matters most.” Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure   “As part of our ambitious economic recovery program, our government is investing in critical infrastructure throughout our province, including right here in Fort McMurray. I’m proud to see $3.2 million invested to ensure compliance with building codes at Keyano. This important investment will create jobs and help keep Albertans employed during these challenging times.” Laila Goodridge, MLA for Fort McMurray-Lac La Biche   “Keyano College is a very valued institution in northern Alberta. Our government’s investment in the north, in Fort McMurray and Keyano College will create much needed jobs during our recovery and serve our community long into the future.” Tany Yao, MLA for Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo   “We are very excited to receive this generous funding from the Government of Alberta to modernize and remediate building code deficiencies at our Clearwater Campus. Keyano has buildings commissioned as early as 1974, and these upgrades will ensure the physical security and safety of our employees, students, and infrastructure. This funding comes at a critical time for Keyano College and the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. Our region was hit hard by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by devastating overland flooding in April, with significant damage to Keyano College properties. Economic stimulus is much needed in our region, and this project will help get Albertans back to work.” Dale Mountain, interim president and CEO, Keyano College   “The Students’ Association of Keyano College is pleased with the additional $3.2 million in capital support from the Government of Alberta. It is well known that Keyano has faced capital challenges in recent years, which were worsened this year due to the flood. This kind of investment in Keyano is great news, and the Student Association of Keyano College would like to say a big thank you to the Government of Alberta.” Chioma Igbokei, president, Students’ Association of Keyano College   ""The Alberta Students' Executive Council thanks the Government of Alberta for their commitment of $98 million from the Capital Maintenance and Renewal Stimulus Fund. This investment comes at an important time for Alberta's institutions and our economy, a fact well recognized by our university, college, and polytechnic student members. ASEC supports this supplemental capital funding, and remains committed to working with the government in building a modern post-secondary system in Alberta."" Emmanauel Barker, director, public relations and advocacy, Alberta Students' Executive Council  In April, the Alberta government announced it was accelerating the capital plan and increasing capital maintenance and renewal spending in 2020-21 to almost $2 billion. Advanced Education worked with post-secondary institutions to identify projects, with a focus on addressing existing maintenance issues, ensuring compliance with building codes and regulations, increasing access to services, and reducing operational costs. Government also prioritized projects that will help create jobs, and are ready for work to begin.

Effective Jan. 1, 2021, Alberta’s government is introducing the Innovation Employment Grant (IEG). This program will promote economic growth and job creation by supporting small and medium-sized businesses that invest in research and development (R&D).  “The Innovation Employment Grant will create good jobs in the critical technology and innovation sectors. Together with Alberta’s Job Creation Tax Cut, this will make Alberta the best place in Canada to start a tech firm. More venture capital will also be available through the Alberta Enterprise Corporation. And, our Skills for Jobs Agenda, together with the start-up visa we are creating through the Alberta Immigration Program, will make our province a magnet for new tech start-ups.” Jason Kenney, Premier   The IEG rewards businesses that make investments in technology and innovation by providing a grant of up to 20 per cent of R&D spending. It is significantly more generous than similar tax credits offered in British Columbia and Ontario.  “The Innovation Employment Grant provides an efficient and explicit incentive for growth and job creation in Alberta's tech and innovation sector. The incremental approach will be unique within Canada and will help attract start-ups and high-growth firms. Companies in pre-income and scale-up phases will benefit from the IEG, and as they become more profitable graduate to the Job Creation Tax Cut. These two initiatives will work together to support the growth of businesses of all sizes.” Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance   With the IEG and a low general business tax rate, Alberta job creators will have a competitive advantage at each stage in their development. The two programs are a major part of government’s plan to make Alberta a top destination for a wide range of businesses.  “Technology is the fastest-growing area of the global economy. Our government is creating an environment where tech sector businesses can flourish and hire folks into the industries of the future. With this added support, we are once again signalling that Alberta is open for business and is one of the best places in the world to invest and do business.” Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism  To provide immediate support to the sector, Alberta’s government will help create up to 4,000 jobs by investing an additional $175 million over three years to Alberta Enterprise Corporation. Alberta Enterprise will use this money to support Alberta’s tech entrepreneurs with the access to capital, operational expertise and industry networks they need to grow their businesses. The Skills for Jobs Agenda will also empower more Albertans to develop the necessary skills and training to find new jobs in the growing technology and innovation sector.  “We’re excited about the renewed support from the Government of Alberta. With this investment we will continue growing the venture capital industry in Alberta, attracting the best venture capital funds to the province, and most importantly, bring the support to help Alberta entrepreneurs create globally successful companies based here.” Kristina Williams, president and CEO, Alberta Enterprise Corporation  Government will examine all of the recommendations outlined in the Innovation Capital Working Group’s report as it builds a formal technology and innovation sector strategy. The report has 14 recommendations, including re-funding Alberta Enterprise Corporation and implementing a tax credit for scientific research.  “Competing globally requires that we attract and retain the very best people who can drive our innovation and entrepreneurship activities. The working group's recommendations focus on people, capital and networks of activities that will support private-sector initiatives and create value. I applaud the government's actions in creating the Innovation Employment Grant as it will have an important impact in this sector.” Joseph Doucet, co-chair, Innovation Capital Working Group  Alberta is also supporting the critical technology and innovation sector through the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program. There are hundreds of thousands of brilliant foreign graduates unable to access immigration status in the United States. Most of these graduates are in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. Alberta’s government will be creating the start-up visa, which will allow our province to attract some of the best and brightest new talent to create jobs and opportunities right here in Alberta. This program will offer qualified grads from top universities an opportunity to launch a start-up enterprise in Alberta as temporary residents. This program will offer a bridge to permanent residency through the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program.  “I applaud the Government of Alberta for its increased technology focus which will help to position Alberta not only for recovery, but increased competitiveness as a location for innovative companies and entrepreneurs. The creation of an R&D incentive like the Innovation Employment Grant and the re-capitalization of Alberta Enterprise Corporation were two key recommendations made in the Innovation Capital Working Group report. I want to thank the Premier and cabinet for accepting these recommendations. I look forward to the forthcoming tech and innovation strategy in the fall as I am confident it will continue to build on the announcements today and ensure Alberta grows as a place of innovation and diverse economic activity.” Adam Legge, co-chair, Innovation Capital Working Group  A full strategy for the province’s innovation and tech sector is expected to be released in fall 2020. Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs now. By building schools, roads and other core infrastructure, we are benefitting our communities. By diversifying our economy and attracting investment with Canada’s most competitive tax environment, we are putting Alberta on a path for a generation of growth. Alberta came together to save lives by flattening the curve and now we must do the same to save livelihoods, grow and thrive. Quick facts  The Innovation Employment Grant will be worth up to 20 per cent of qualifying R&D expenditures. Details include:  	 An eight per cent payment on a corporation’s base level of R&D spending, providing stable support for all small and medium-sized firms undertaking R&D. A 20 per cent incremental payment on increasing R&D spending – an approach that is unique within Canada.   Alberta Enterprise is a Crown corporation with a mission to foster a thriving venture capital industry in Alberta.  	 It does not invest directly in Alberta companies – it invests in proven venture capital funds that have a record of success.  		 The venture capital funds invest in knowledge-based industries, including information technology, industrial technology and life sciences.   It has received a total of $175 million from the government since 2008. The corporation has generated $4 of investment back into Alberta companies for every $1 it has invested.   The Innovation Capital Working Group was established to provide government with advice on how to incentivize capital investment in the province’s tech and innovation ecosystems.  	 The committee included representatives from key areas of Alberta’s tech, business, academic and financial communities.  		 Joseph Doucet and Adam Legge co-chaired the committee.

A new research working group will examine funding disparities and engage the federal government to get Alberta’s post-secondary institutions their fair share of research dollars. This group will also complement the Alberta 2030: Transforming Post-Secondary Education project by exploring ways to increase the commercialization of intellectual property at post-secondary institutions and help identify benchmarks for research and innovation. Over the last 15 years, post-secondary institutions across Canada received an average of 48 per cent of their total sponsored research revenue from the federal government. However, Alberta’s post-secondary institutions only received an average of 37 per cent of their total sponsored research revenue. That’s why government is bringing post-secondary institutions and industry together to study this issue.  “Alberta taxpayers have contributed the highest percentage of provincial-sponsored research revenue of any other province, at 31 per cent. By bringing universities, government, Alberta Innovates, and representatives of various industries to the table, we will forge stronger relationships between researchers, government and business enterprise, and we will secure a fair deal for Alberta.” Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education   “Our platform committed to finding ways to increase the commercialization of intellectual property at post-secondary institutions, and to measure Alberta’s performance against leading innovation hubs. We’re working closely with our colleagues at Advanced Education so that we keep our promise, and bring in the federal funds that Alberta’s post-secondary institutions deserve and need to succeed, now and in the future.” Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism   “We know first-hand the important role intergovernmental collaboration plays in unlocking world-renowned research capacity: first as a centre of artificial intelligence excellence supported by the Government of Alberta and now as part of the federal Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy. We’re pleased to be part of this important work, which will further enhance Alberta’s position as a global leader in research.” Cam Linke, CEO, Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute   “Technology and innovation will increase opportunities for more jobs and investment and improved environmental performance. The research working group provides a constructive opportunity to help define research priorities that will attract increased investment and drive the commercialization of innovation in Canada’s oil and natural gas industry.” Joy Romero, vice president, technology and innovation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited   “We thank the ministries of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism and Advanced Education for convening this research working group.  This initiative exemplifies the Government of Alberta's commitment to supporting the research and innovation activities of Alberta's post-secondary institutions. At the University of Calgary, we are excited to work with government leaders and our partner institutions to advance Alberta's performance in research and innovation.” William A. Ghali, vice president, research, University of Calgary   “The University of Lethbridge is currently ranked third among research-intensive Canadian universities in the primarily undergraduate category by Research Infosource. The Government of Alberta’s research working group creates inter-ministry and inter-university synergies – and brings crucial perspective from industry – that will strategically support the University of Lethbridge in achieving even greater levels of research success. The additional federal and external funding that we leverage will support innovative research for the health, well-being, and enrichment of our society, as well as the commercialization of important intellectual property for the benefit of all Albertans.” Robert Wood, vice-president, research, University of Lethbridge   “The University of Alberta is proud to be a member of the initiative and to further enhance our longstanding history of working with the Government of Alberta and partner institutions across the province to secure and leverage federal research funds. This is good news not only for Albertans, but for all Canadians, as these research funds support world-leading research in areas such as artificial intelligence, energy development, and public Health, such as our world-leading research in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Having a team Alberta approach will help us secure the resources needed to spur the innovation that drives economic growth and diversification, improves societal outcomes, and creates new jobs.” Walter Dixon, interim vice-president, research and innovation, University of Alberta   “I’m proud to support this research working group – this is a great opportunity to bring together technology, innovation and research. I believe investing in today’s post secondary research will be of huge benefit to Alberta’s future.” Yeatland Wong, senior ITS engineer, Stantec   “We’re very encouraged to be included in the research working group. We continue to be impressed by the commercialization opportunities that are available for the research being conducted at our universities. Measuring economic impacts from university research is progressive and helps align industry and research for the benefit of all Albertans.” Rohit Joshi, CEO, Brightsquid  Alberta’s post-secondary institutions are leaders in various areas of research, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, antimicrobial resistance, autonomous systems, hydrodynamics and biophysics, energy systems, and quantum science and technology. Quick facts  Members of the research working group include:  	 Deputy Ministers of Advanced Education and Economic Development, Trade and Tourism Vice-presidents of research at the University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of Lethbridge and Athabasca University Laura Kilcrease, CEO, Alberta Innovates Joy Romero, vice-president of technology and innovation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, and chair, Clean Resources Innovation Network Rohit Joshi, CEO, Brightsquid Secure Communications Corp. Cam Linke, CEO, Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) Keith Jones, general manager and chief financial officer, Rowland Farms Yeatland Wong, senior ITS engineer, Stantec   Any costs incurred by the research working group will be covered by existing government budgets. Members of the research working group will not receive any compensation. Between the fiscal years 2003-04 and 2017-18, Alberta’s universities and degree-granting colleges received an average of 37 per cent of their total sponsored research revenue from the federal government. Over the same 15 years, other provinces received between 46 per cent and 72 per cent (or an average of 48 per cent) of their sponsored research revenue from the federal government. In 2017-18, Alberta’s institutions received about nine per cent of total federal research funding, while the province’s population was about 12 per cent of Canada’s total population; this was the largest discrepancy in per capita funding of all the provinces.

Schools will be ready to welcome students under scenario 1, which is near-normal daily operations with health measures. Alberta’s government has developed a re-entry tool kit to prepare parents and students for what to expect in the new school year. The tool kit includes videos for students explaining some of the health measures, a guide for parents, frequently asked questions, school posters, a self-screening questionnaire in multiple languages, and links to health guidelines.  “Alberta continues moving ahead with our recovery and relaunch plan. I’m proud of our comprehensive plan that supports the safe return to daily in-school learning. The return of more than 750,000 students to near-normal learning in the new school year is indicative of Alberta’s continued recovery as we work to relaunch our economy and return to our regular everyday lives.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “We are determined to do everything that we can to safely return our students, teachers and staff to school. I appreciate the input and support of school authorities across the province, as well as our education partners, in developing and refining our school re-entry plan. We are providing clear and detailed guidelines and a re-entry tool kit so everyone can do their part and prepare for a safe return to school.” Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education   “We are committed to doing everything possible to protect the health and safety of students, staff and families during the upcoming school year. There is no risk-free approach to COVID-19 but there are also risks to children’s overall health from school closures. We are continually refining our public health advice for schools based on best available evidence. We also have plans in place to respond quickly when cases are identified. Limiting the spread of the virus in schools will require the dedication and support of all Albertans when the school year begins this fall.” Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health  Under scenario 1, schools will implement a number of public health measures, which include frequent cleaning of surfaces, placing hand sanitizers at school entrances and classrooms, grouping students in cohorts, and planning the school day to allow for physical distancing, which could include staggering start times for classes, recesses and lunches. Additional public health measures may be established prior to September on the advice of the chief medical officer of health in consultation with the education system. In addition, students, staff, parents and school visitors will be expected to use a self-screening questionnaire daily to determine whether they can enter the school.  “The Alberta School Boards Association is pleased that this plan was released earlier than expected as it provides more time for finalizing school board plans. We appreciate the various experts, parents and community members that helped inform a plan that prioritizes the health and safety of students and staff. ASBA and all school boards will work diligently to implement this plan and look forward to continuing to work with the Minister of Education throughout the upcoming school year.” Lorrie Jess, president, Alberta School Boards Association   “The College of Alberta School Superintendents appreciates the opportunity to work alongside government and education partners to develop a detailed re-entry plan. The CASS board of directors strongly believes that the re-entry plan offers the appropriate balance of guidance from the chief medical officer of health and the government while providing for the authority and autonomy for individual school divisions to assure their students, parents and staff that a successful return to school will be safe.” Bevan Daverne, president, College of Alberta School Superintendents   “We value the government’s efforts to actively work with the education system, including independent schools, as they finalized details for the 2020-21 school year. Re-entry under scenario 1 gives us the information and confidence we need to prepare our schools for reopening. We appreciate the requirements set out by the government to ensure that student and staff safety remains the priority as we navigate through these times to safely move closer towards a sense of normalcy.” Simon Williams, president, Association of Independent Schools & Colleges in Alberta   “The health of students and staff is the priority. In our recent survey on re-entry, 86 per cent of parents that participated indicated they were in favour of a return to school plan for K-12 students. Community efforts are essential to ensure a safe learning environment for our children.” Brandi Rai, president, Alberta School Councils’ Association   “The Association of Alberta Public Charter Schools is pleased the government invested the time to engage with the education system as they pragmatically developed the 2020-21 school re-entry plan. This announcement provides Alberta’s public charter schools with the confidence and responsiveness they need to ensure a safe and successful return for the upcoming school year.” Ron Koper, chair, The Association of Alberta Public Charter Schools  Successful transition to summer school and child care Alberta’s school re-entry plan works, and already has mitigated risks to students and teachers. Throughout the summer, the Calgary Catholic Separate School Division ran in-person summer school programming in accordance to the guidelines developed and issued by the province. These comprehensive guidelines have mitigated risk, resulting in no COVID-19 outbreaks among teachers or students participating in summer school. Additionally, Alberta has seen a successful reopening of child care centres across the province. Children and staff have safely returned to these centres with no outbreaks occurring. School authority funding School authorities have returned to full funding levels as of July 1, and every school authority in Alberta is receiving a funding increase for the 2020-21 school year – roughly $120 million across the province. A list of funding for every school authority is available here. In addition, the Minister of Education has approved the use of school board reserves, if needed, to help cover local COVID-19-related costs. The total amount of money sitting in school board reserves is $363 million. Accelerated capital school funding The province has also provided school boards an additional $250 million to support accelerated capital maintenance and renewal projects, as part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced in the Alberta Recovery Plan.  This funding supports infrastructure enhancements that will help in a COVID-19 learning environment. Seventy-nine school projects totalling $15 million are moving forward with this primary purpose, including upgrades for enhanced hygiene such as hands-free sinks, automatic flush toilets, touchless soap and paper towel dispensers, automatic doors and water bottle filling stations to replace water fountains. New online Student Learning Hub A new Student Learning Hub on new.learnalberta.ca is available for parents, students, and teachers to more easily access educational materials to support development of student literacy and numeracy, and provide health and wellness information. The online hub is another resource to support Alberta’s school re-entry plan, with recognition that more online learning resources may be needed during the upcoming school year. Additional resources will also be added throughout the school year.   Expanding diploma exams Diploma exams will be offered in every subject in the November and April exam sessions. Expanding the offerings of the diploma exams will support school authorities who are shifting high school programming to a four-semester system as part of their COVID-19 re-entry plan. This shift allows for better cohorting by limiting the number of classes a student is in during a term without affecting total learning time over the course of a year. Personal protective equipment Students and staff may wear a mask if they choose to. However, practices such as physical distancing, cohorting, frequent handwashing, staying home when sick and increased cleaning of surfaces will continue to be the priority public health measures. COVID-19 cases at school If a student or staff tests positive for COVID-19, a public health team will investigate to determine when symptoms developed and support the school to minimize transmission. While each case will be addressed based on its unique circumstances, it is anticipated that in most cases only the group of students and staff who came in close contact will likely be required to stay home for 14 days, and not the entire school population. Parents will be notified if a case of COVID-19 is confirmed at school and public health officials will contact those who were in close contact with that person. Transitioning to scenario 2 or scenario 3 If there is an outbreak of COVID-19 in a community or school, health officials will work with Alberta Education and impacted school authorities to make any decision to potentially transition to partial in-class learning or at-home learning. Decisions will be based on multiple factors including the number of cases in a community or school and the risk of ongoing transmission. The health guidance for scenario 2 has been updated to allow for a maximum of 20 students per class.

The project includes replacing heating, ventilation and cooling systems in the Eric Harvey Theatre and support systems in the attached Margaret Greenham Theatre and Laszlo Funtek Teaching Wing. Performers, audience members, students and staff will all benefit from more reliable building infrastructure. The labour involved in this project will generate about 14 well-paying jobs in the Banff community. As part of the economic recovery plan, government recently committed $98 million to repair and restoration projects at colleges, universities and polytechnics. This additional funding, on top of the $118.5 million already included in Budget 2020, will create about 533 full-time jobs across Alberta.  “Alberta's Recovery Plan is an ambitious strategy to create jobs, build and diversify. The Banff Centre provides innovative arts and culture programs and plays a unique and important role in our post-secondary system. Funding these upgrades will create immediate jobs in the Banff area, while helping to ensure students have a safe space in which they can pursue their creative passions.” Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education   “Alberta’s Recovery Plan focuses on infrastructure as a critical component for supporting economic growth and jobs for Albertans. This includes investing in shovel-ready projects to upgrade and maintain public facilities, like this post-secondary institution, that help keep Albertans working and stimulate local economies where it matters most.” Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure   “The Banff Centre is the largest proponent of arts in my riding and the largest post-secondary arts institution in Canada. Our government appreciates their contribution to the arts, and as such, this $2.5 million to upgrade heating, cooling and other systems is another way to affirm that. The effects of COVID-19 have been devastating on the Banff Centre, and this funding will help ensure they are sustainable for the future.” Miranda Rosin, MLA for Banff-Kananaskis   “We are very grateful to receive this capital renewal investment for the Banff Centre campus. This funding will allow Banff Centre to replace 50-year-old heating and ventilation systems in the theatre complex, supporting the overall comfort and experience of artists who come here to train and work on their craft, and the audiences who benefit from the artist performances.” Janice Price, president and CEO, Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity  In April, the Alberta government announced it was accelerating the capital plan and increasing capital maintenance and renewal spending in 2020-21 to almost $2 billion. Advanced Education worked with post-secondary institutions to identify projects, with a focus on addressing existing maintenance issues, ensuring compliance with building codes and regulations, increasing access to services, and reducing operational costs. Government also prioritized projects that will help create jobs, and are ready for work to begin. Alberta’s Recovery Plan is a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build, diversify, and create tens of thousands of jobs, now.

In October 2019, Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) launched the Natural Gas Challenge and invited technology developers to share project concepts for innovation opportunities in Alberta’s natural gas industry. Alberta’s government is providing $58 million through ERA to support this opportunity to create jobs in the natural gas sector. Funding recipients include a project that uses artificial intelligence to locate and measure methane emissions, and a project to produce renewable natural gas from biogas at an agricultural facility that will be the first of its kind in Alberta. The 20 new projects have the potential to reduce a cumulative one million tonnes of emissions by 2030 – the same as taking about 750,000 cars off Alberta’s roads. These projects will also get Albertans back to work by creating more than 750 new jobs when they are needed most.  “Investing in innovation and technology gets Albertans back to work, while ensuring the resilience of our responsible natural resource sector. We’re telling the world that Alberta is open for business. As we move forward with Alberta’s Recovery Plan, we will continue to invest and build partnerships that help get our province back on track. Alberta is already a leader when it comes to our environmental footprint, and our ongoing work with Emissions Reduction Alberta will help us become even better. Congratulations to the successful Natural Gas Challenge funding recipients. We look forward to watching these exciting projects take shape.” Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks  Projects were selected through ERA’s competitive review process. Experts in science, engineering, business development, commercialization, financing, and greenhouse gas quantification reviewed 117 submissions and chose projects based on the strongest potential for success.  “Unlocking innovation across our natural gas sector will create jobs while helping industry become more efficient. With Alberta’s 300-year supply of affordable natural gas, a technically skilled workforce and world-class environmentally responsible facilities, there is tremendous opportunity for Alberta to compete with international markets. Funding opportunities like this, in partnership with Emissions Reduction Alberta, are critical to attracting investments that will grow Alberta’s economy by reducing upfront costs, while reducing our province’s share of global emissions.” Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity  Government funds ERA through the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) system. TIER is an improved system to help energy-intensive facilities find innovative ways to reduce emissions and invest in clean technology to stay competitive and save money. Facilities can pay into a TIER Fund, which is used for innovative and cleaner Alberta-based projects like those selected under the Natural Gas Challenge. ERA’s funding model requires that every dollar committed to an initiative is matched or exceeded by additional investments, which ensures there is a market demand for the technology. Government’s $58-million investment through ERA has been more than doubled by private and public investment to stimulate the economy, lower emissions and create jobs, leading to a total of $155 million in funding.  “Investing in the next wave of technological advancements will help Canada’s natural gas industry achieve new efficiencies, reduce costs, and continue to drive world-leading environmental performance.” Steve MacDonald, CEO, Emissions Reduction Alberta  A complete list of the successful Natural Gas Challenge projects can be found here.  “We are grateful for ERA’s support to help fund Canadian Natural’s ALT-FEMP project. By working together, we will develop and pilot technologies that can be adopted across the industry to enable early detection of methane emissions through cost-effective methods, ultimately accelerating industry’s reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These performance improvements play an important role in supporting industry’s competitiveness and sustainability that meets Canada’s and the world’s long-term energy needs.” Joy Romero, vice-president of technology and innovation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited   “Hydrogen can play a central role in affordably decarbonizing the production of heat in our homes and businesses, while also supporting economic growth and diversification across our province. The funding received from ERA will enable ATCO to pursue this low-carbon option for our customers, starting with a pilot project in Fort Saskatchewan. This project is an important first step for Alberta, which has all the ingredients to be a leader in the hydrogen economy – including the ability to produce a near zero-emission hydrogen at a lower cost than most jurisdictions in the world.” George Lidgett, executive vice-president and general manager, Canadian Utilities Inc.   ""ERA is making an instrumental contribution to Ekona’s product development process. ERA’s financial contribution and reporting requirements will enable Ekona to move quicker by leveraging our equity investments and by providing additional project oversight, helping to foster even greater focus on key progress milestones. Without ERA’s support, Ekona would not be able to progress to the field trial stage in a timeframe commensurate with customer expectation.” Chris Reid, chief executive officer, Ekona Power  Quick facts  In 2018, Alberta produced almost 70 per cent of the marketable natural gas in Canada. ERA works with government, industry and innovators to support technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2009, ERA has committed $607 million in funds from industrial carbon pricing toward 183 projects worth $4.1 billion that are reducing emissions, keeping industries competitive, and leading to new investment opportunities. These 183 projects are estimated to deliver cumulative reductions of 34.8 million tonnes of emissions by 2030.

We dedicated a portion of our Recovery Plan to ensure infrastructure was being dedicated to the vulnerable people in our communities. These recovery communities are a continuation of our efforts at creating 4,000 addiction treatment spaces in the province and building a full continuum of care for people struggling with addiction.” Jason Kenney, Premier   Recovery communities, also known as therapeutic communities, are a form of long-term residential treatment for addiction, used in more than 65 countries around the world. Recovery is seen as a gradual, ongoing process of cognitive change through clinical and peer interventions. Program participants advance through the stages of treatment at their own pace, setting personal objectives and assuming greater responsibilities in the community along the way.  “I am excited to announce the first of five recovery communities will be in Red Deer. This is an important step in the expansion of our mental health and addiction recovery strategy. I want to thank the City of Red Deer for their tremendous partnership on this important project. Their commitment to the community and the people struggling with addiction has been second to none.” Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions  Recovery communities encourage participants to examine their personal behaviour to help them become more pro-social and positively engaged citizens – considered to be based on honesty, taking responsibility, hard work, and willingness to learn. The goal is for a participant to leave the program not only drug-free but also employed or in school or training. Five recovery communities are being built across Alberta. It is anticipated recovery communities will begin accepting participants in spring 2021.    “Today’s announcement by the Government of Alberta responds to a long-standing critical health and social need in our community. The lives and well-being of our loved ones matter most of all, and this vital investment will significantly help our local addictions response by ensuring access to treatment for individuals and families affected by addictions in Red Deer and central Alberta.”  Tara Veer, mayor, City of Red Deer   “I am pleased to hear that a recovery community is coming to Red Deer. This facility is poised to have a dramatic impact on those struggling with addiction in Red Deer and in central Alberta.

Government developed the Indigenous Housing Capital Program (IHCP) to increase the supply of affordable off-reserve, off-settlement and on-settlement housing for Indigenous communities. The Alberta government will invest $32 million in IHCP over three years. Changes to the program expand the types of housing units eligible for funding – market and below-market housing will now be eligible to support mixed-income housing projects. Indigenous housing providers will have more autonomy to manage their assets. The redesign encourages public and private developers to partner with Indigenous governments and organizations to create economic opportunity and support program sustainability. The program will fund Indigenous governments and organizations first. Non-Indigenous applicants, like housing management bodies and other operators, will only be eligible for funding if they apply with an Indigenous partner.  “The guiding principle of the Indigenous Housing Capital Program is to support housing designed, delivered and owned by, and for, Indigenous communities. Our government remains committed to a partnership with Alberta’s Indigenous Peoples in pursuit of reconciliation, inclusion and opportunity.’’ Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing   “We all know that Indigenous people are grossly overrepresented in the data that explores those experiencing homelessness. Everyone deserves a safe, affordable and accessible home. This program will go a long ways to achieving that goal for many.” Rick Wilson, Minister of Indigenous Relations   “Housing is a basic need and there is a significant gap in access to this need in our nation. Through our Métis Urban Housing and Métis Capital Housing corporations, the Métis Nation of Alberta strives to provide safe, clean and affordable housing to our citizens most in need, and with this program we will be able to enhance our ability to continue doing just that in ways that make sense for our government and our citizens. We truly look forward to providing more opportunities for our citizens to access this important necessity.’’ Aaron Barner, senior executive officer, Métis Nation of Alberta and the Métis Capital Housing Corporation   “The Paul First Nation, during the last 18 months, has worked with the Government of Alberta’s Seniors and Housing and the private sector in a commitment to develop an off-reserve housing strategy to provide access to safe, secure, adequate and affordable housing.

This agreement will help our economy take the next steps to recover from the impacts of COVID-19 as we work to keep Albertans and all Canadians safe and healthy. “The total value of the agreement, which covers all 13 provinces and territories and addresses several areas of the economy and public health needs for the next six to eight months, is $19 billion. This includes funding for testing, PPE for front-line workers, child care, mental health, and protecting the most vulnerable Canadians, including our seniors. The Government of Canada's decision to recognize and credit the work already done by the provinces in the fight against the virus will be particularly helpful to Alberta, which has led the country on PPE procurement and testing. “The agreement also includes new funding for sick leave pay and funding to help offset some of the lost operating revenue facing municipalities, including for public transit. We look forward to working with the municipalities on announcing the details of this new funding in the days ahead. “Alberta’s government has acted in unprecedented ways to protect people through the worst of the COVID-19 economic and public health crises.

The Safe Restart Agreement announced today will complement and accelerate Alberta on that path to recovery. I would like to thank the federal government for working with the provinces, listening to our concerns, and responding to them. I would especially like to thank my fellow premiers, whose solidarity, mutual understanding, and dedication to the good of our country resulted in a deal that is more generous, fair, and flexible than where we started. “Albertans have contributed more than $600 billion to the rest of the federation over the past 60 years, and we continue to contribute $20 billion each year even as our workers and our economy are severely strained, so we appreciate that this relief represents a small portion of our net tax contribution to the federation coming back to our province through this package.”   Le premier ministre Jason Kenney a fait la déclaration suivante, dans laquelle il se félicite de l'accord sur la relance sécuritaire : « Je suis heureux d'annoncer qu'après plusieurs semaines de négociations, les provinces se sont entendues avec le gouvernement fédéral sur un accord sur la relance sécuritaire. Cet accord aidera notre économie à se remettre des effets de la COVID-19, pendant que nous nous efforçons d'assurer la sécurité et la santé des Albertains et de tous les Canadiens. « La valeur totale de l'accord, qui se rapporte aux 13 provinces et territoires et qui porte sur plusieurs domaines de l'économie et sur les besoins en matière de santé publique pour les six à huit prochains mois, s'élève à 19 milliards de dollars. Ce montant comprend le financement des tests, de l'EPI pour les travailleurs de première ligne, des services de garde d'enfants, des soins de santé mentale et de la protection des Canadiens et des Canadiennes les plus vulnérables, y compris nos personnes âgées. La décision du gouvernement du Canada de reconnaître et de créditer le travail déjà accompli par les provinces dans la lutte contre le virus sera particulièrement utile à l'Alberta, qui a été la chef de file du pays en matière de test et d'approvisionnement en EPI.  « L'accord prévoit également un nouveau financement pour les indemnités de congé de maladie, en plus de fonds qui aideront à compenser une partie des pertes de revenus d'exploitation auxquelles sont confrontées les municipalités, notamment pour les transports publics. Nous nous réjouissons à l’idée de travailler avec les municipalités pour annoncer les détails de ce nouveau financement dans les jours à venir. « Le gouvernement de l'Alberta a pris des mesures sans précédent pour protéger la population pendant l’épicentre des crises économique et de santé publique causées par la COVID-19. À ce jour, nous avons fourni une aide de quelque 14 milliards de dollars – plus que toute autre province, en termes relatifs – en mettant en œuvre les mesures suivantes :  Plus d'un demi-milliard de dollars injectés dans notre système de santé. Des mesures de soutien mises en place dans les foyers de soins de longue durée et à l’intention de ceux et celles qui y travaillent. Des indemnités d'isolement d'urgence, pour que les travailleurs malades puissent rester chez eux. Jusqu'à 200 millions de dollars de subventions pour la relance des petites entreprises, pour celles qui ont dû fermer. Du soutien aux refuges pour sans-abri, aux refuges pour femmes et aux banques alimentaires. Plus de 50 millions de dollars en soutien à la santé mentale lié à COVID pour ceux qui luttent pour faire face à la situation. 40 millions de masques gratuits pour aider à limiter la propagation. Des fonds pour aider les exploitants de garderies à rouvrir. Un report des factures de services publics, des taxes foncières sur l'éducation, des prêts étudiants et des frais gouvernementaux. Un accès au crédit pour les employeurs en difficulté. Des politiques visant à protéger à la fois les locataires d’habitations et les locataires commerciaux.  « À la fin du mois dernier, nous avons lancé le plan de relance de l'Alberta : une stratégie à long terme audacieuse et ambitieuse pour bâtir et diversifier notre économie, en plus de créer des dizaines de milliers d'emplois, dès maintenant. L'accord sur la relance sécuritaire annoncée aujourd'hui complétera et accélérera le cheminement de l'Alberta vers la reprise. Je tiens à remercier le gouvernement fédéral d'avoir travaillé avec les provinces, d'avoir écouté nos préoccupations et d'y avoir répondu. J'aimerais remercier tout particulièrement mes collègues premiers ministres, dont la solidarité, la compréhension mutuelle et le dévouement pour le bien de notre pays ont permis de conclure une entente plus généreuse, plus équitable et plus souple que celle que nous avions au départ. « Les Albertains et les Albertaines ont versé plus de 600 milliards de dollars au reste de la fédération au cours des 60 dernières années, et nous continuons à verser 20 milliards de dollars chaque année alors que nos travailleurs et notre économie sont mis à rude épreuve. Nous sommes donc reconnaissants que cet allègement, qui représente une petite partie de notre contribution fiscale nette à la fédération, revienne à notre province grâce à cet accord.

This includes investing in shovel-ready projects to upgrade and maintain public facilities, like this post-secondary institution, that help keep Albertans working and stimulate local economies where it matters most.” Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure   “This funding will not only serve my constituents of Brooks-Medicine Hat, but also Albertans across the province. Medicine Hat College provides a high-quality education to many students in southern Alberta and attracts students from throughout Western Canada. Investing in campus infrastructure will ensure that Medicine Hat College can continue to meet students’ needs now and into the future.” Michaela Glasgo, MLA for Brooks-Medicine Hat   “I am pleased that the government is providing funding for the replacement of the electrical substation at Medicine Hat College. Thank you to the Minister of Advanced Education for recognizing this much needed update. The reliable operation of the college’s electrical system will ensure that the facility will continue providing valuable training to its students.” Drew Barnes, MLA for Cypress-Medicine Hat   ""The opportunity to update the college’s 50-year-old electrical infrastructure is welcome. This $850,000 investment will replace our primary electrical service and substation, and replace overhead cables with underground lines. These actions will reduce maintenance costs, and increase the security and stability of our power supply to help sustain college operations for decades to come.” Kevin Shufflebotham, president and CEO, Medicine Hat College   ""The Alberta Students' Executive Council thanks the Government of Alberta for their commitment of $98 million from the Capital Maintenance and Renewal Stimulus Fund. This investment comes at an important time for Alberta's institutions and our economy, a fact well recognized by our university, college, and polytechnic student members. ASEC supports this supplemental capital funding, and remains committed to working with the government in building a modern post-secondary system in Alberta."" Emmanauel Barker, director, public relations and advocacy, Alberta Students' Executive Council   “The announcement of the additional funding allocation opens up opportunities for Medicine Hat College to preserve and upgrade the campus by pursuing further infrastructure and maintenance projects, in turn enhancing the student experience.” Veronica Yeoman, president, Students’ Association of Medicine Hat College  In April, the Alberta government announced it was accelerating the capital plan and increasing capital maintenance and renewal spending in 2020-21 to almost $2 billion. Advanced Education worked with post-secondary institutions to identify projects, with a focus on addressing existing maintenance issues, ensuring compliance with building codes and regulations, increasing access to services, and reducing operational costs. Government also prioritized projects that will help create jobs, and are ready for work to begin. The Medicine Hat College project is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending, $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal, $200 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects, $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects, $500 million in municipal infrastructure and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL. Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and returns investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada.

The independent accounting firm Deloitte conducted a grant expenditure audit after the Alberta government learned of possible financial irregularities within the ARCHES organization. The review substantiated allegations of asset and funding misappropriation, non-compliance with grant agreements, and inappropriate governance and organizational operations. The ARCHES organization was found to have seriously mismanaged taxpayer funds meant for the most vulnerable in our society.    “It is disturbing and extremely disappointing to me that taxpayer funds allocated to this organization in order to serve the most vulnerable in Lethbridge would be used for European conferences, expenses for retreats, entertainment and gift cards. Our government will not stand idly by while millions in taxpayer funds are missing or misappropriated.” Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions  Below is a summary of the audit’s findings:  $1,617,094 unaccounted for due to missing documentation for expenditures from 2017 to 2018. $13,000 of interest off ARCHES bank accounts was used to fund parties, staff retreats, entertainment and gift cards. A senior executive’s compensation totalled $342,943 for calendar year 2019. This includes $70,672 in overtime for fiscal year 2019-20. The grant agreement allows for a salary of $80,000.   The Everyone Comes Together (ECT) program staff salaries and benefits also exceeded the amount allocated by the grant agreement by $16,000. The number of ARCHES employees is greater than allowed by the grant agreement.  ARCHES maintained up to 126 employees. However, the exact number could not be verified. $4,301 spent on European travel for management to attend a conference in Portugal. Thousands of dollars in unverifiable travel expenses, including trips charged to company credit cards but not recorded in the ledger. A senior executive’s family member was hired, earning $9,900. The auditors could not locate a resume or personnel file to verify any qualifications. $7,557 for management retreats, including meals and mileage where documentation for spending was unclear. The grant agreement requires the organization to maintain the funding received from Alberta Health within a separate bank account; however, the audit revealed that it was comingled with other funding sources. As a result of ARCHES comingling their accounts, the auditors could not verify thousands of dollars of expenses. Proper personal conflict of interest declarations were not recorded when related individuals or vendors were hired or utilized. Vendors were repeatedly secured in secrecy with a lack of transparency and accountability. No petty cash reconciliations have been completed. $1,129 was used to buy gift cards for board members for The Keg, iTunes, Boston Pizza, Earls, Gap, Shell, Chapters, Cineplex, Amazon, Starbuck’s, Tim Hortons, MasterCard, and Bath and Bodyworks. The expense was recorded as “Gift cards – Board Members.” $2,100 was spent on gift cards to The Oil Changer – a business owned by a senior executive’s spouse. $2,205 was spent on a television with no receipt documentation to support the purchase.  The auditors were unable to complete the grant expenditure review in respect to all allegations received or provide a complete financial value attributable to each allegation, due to the state of ARCHES’ records and the related outstanding documents. Due to missing funds and unverifiable transactions, as well as allegations, which could not be investigated in the scope of this audit, government will consult with law enforcement to determine whether further investigation is warranted.   To ensure people struggling with addiction can continue to receive services, government has asked Alberta Health Services to set up a temporary mobile overdose prevention site in Lethbridge with the goal of seamlessly transitioning services. Government will also be adding three recovery coaches to the region to assist in expediting individuals into treatment. Quick facts  ARCHES has received more than $14.4 million in taxpayer dollars over the past two years. In June, government announced an additional $4 million over four years to expand access to the virtual opioid dependency program to allow Albertans to use telehealth technology to access treatment for opioid use disorder. Also announced was the opioid agonist therapy gap coverage program to cover the costs of medications to treat opioid use disorder for Albertans waiting to receive coverage through a supplementary health benefit plan. As part of the $140-million mental health and addiction commitment to create 4,000 spaces, government has announced additional treatment spaces at Poundmaker’s Lodge Treatment Centres, Sunrise Healing Lodge, Fresh Start Recovery Centre, Thorpe Recovery Centre, and the Blood Tribe Bringing the Spirit Home detox centre.

The funds are intended to help apprentices manage costs like tuition, books, material fees, tools, transportation and living expenses during their classroom instruction period.  “Alberta’s Recovery Plan is an ambitious plan to build, diversify and create jobs. As our economy recovers and labour market demand increases, we need skilled people to fill those jobs. That is why we are increasing financial support to about 3,300 unemployed apprentices so they can continue their training and get back to work.” Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education   “Skilled tradespeople are the backbone of Alberta’s economy. Their work has been critical to several essential sectors during the pandemic, and they will continue to support the Alberta economy as it moves towards economic recovery. This investment will help apprentices continue their classroom training so they can get back to work."" Paul Verhesen, partner, Clark Builders   “Fostering careers in the skilled trades is incredibly important for both Alberta’s economy and our communities. The Building Trades of Alberta is pleased the province will increase the Apprenticeship Training Award, which will further assist thousands of apprentices in Alberta as they continue their paths to becoming certified journeypersons in the trade of their choice.” Terry Parker, executive director, Building Trades Alberta   “It has been a challenging time for our province – this support from the Government of Alberta will ensure unemployed apprentices can continue their education. This increase in the Apprentice Training Award will provide additional support when apprentices truly need it.” Ray Block, president and CEO, Northern Alberta Institute of Technology   “As the economy recovers, we know the demand for the innovative, highly skilled tradespeople industry requires will continue to grow. SAIT welcomes the government’s financial support for apprentices. This support will assist them through their important training as they advance their meaningful careers that will be key to Alberta’s prosperity.” Brad Donaldson, vice-president, academic, SAIT   “The path to a rewarding career is the skilled trades and our apprenticeship community, employers and educators know the importance of apprentices in our province. That means supplying them with jobs and opportunities to attend technical training. We must retain our apprentices and support them to complete their chosen programs. This Apprentice Training Award has helped over 9000 apprentices and it can help so many more. On behalf of the Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training board, we encourage apprentices to continue on their path to Trade certification and take advantage of this Award.” j’Amey Bevan, board chair, Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training Board   “ASEC is very grateful for this award funding increase. Trades and technology graduates will be essential for rebuilding our economy following the provincial reopening – this increased funding for apprenticeship education will encourage prospective students and will support current learners.

At about 8 p.m., Edmonton Police Service (EPS) officers operating a marked police vehicle encountered a black Honda Accord which was displaying a licence plate different from the one registered to it. EPS officers attempted to conduct a traffic stop on the Accord in the area of 101 Street and Jasper Avenue, but the vehicle failed to stop and fled the scene. The officers declared a criminal flight response, and notified a supervisor. The supervisor ordered the officers to terminate the pursuit. The subject vehicle left the area, and shortly thereafter, the officers arrived at the scene of a motor vehicle collision on the Walterdale Bridge involving the Honda Accord and an unrelated second vehicle. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) declared the driver of the subject vehicle deceased at the scene of the collision. A passenger in the Accord was transported to hospital and remains in stable condition. The driver of the unrelated vehicle was transported to the hospital by ambulance and released July 15 at 5 a.m. ASIRT is asking anyone who was in the area before or at the time of the collision and who witnessed or has video of the incident to contact ASIRT investigators at 780-644-1483.

Replacing the old piping system will help avoid more expensive repairs in the years ahead, and ensure staff and students can continue to benefit from reliable campus infrastructure. Additionally, the project will generate new job opportunities for about 19 skilled contractors and tradespeople in the Lethbridge area. While Budget 2020 already includes $118.5 million for capital maintenance and renewal at colleges, universities and polytechnics, funding for this project is part of an additional $98-million commitment, which is expected to create about 533 full-time jobs around the province.  “Alberta’s Recovery Plan is an ambitious plan to build, diversity and create jobs.

As part of Alberta’s Economic Recovery Plan, $25 million will support the construction of life-changing recovery communities. More than 65 countries around the world use this evidence-based approach to substance use recovery, including the highly regarded Portuguese model.   “We know recovery is possible for people struggling with addiction and mental health and that is why we are dramatically expanding treatment spaces in our province. Building recovery communities in our province will make it easier for Albertans to access a range of services and get on a lifelong path to recovery.” Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions  Recovery communities (RCs) focus on the whole person and overall lifestyle changes, not simply abstinence from drug use. Recovery is seen as a gradual, ongoing process of cognitive change through clinical and peer interventions. Program participants advance through the stages of treatment at their own pace, setting personal objectives and assuming greater responsibilities in the community along the way. RCs encourage participants to examine their personal behaviour to help them become more pro-social and positively engaged citizens – considered to be based on honesty, taking responsibility, hard work, and willingness to learn. The goal is for a participant to leave the program not only drug-free but also employed or in school or training. Recovery communities will be part of an integrated system that encompasses clients of the health-care system, justice system, and community social services system.  “As a person in recovery and an alumnus of a peer-supported community program, I'm a firm believer that for a person to achieve long-term recovery, community is essential. The Alberta model is a prominent model for success. Having like-minded people in recovery, living in the same community, makes perfect sense. With a recovery community setting, success rates will increase with long-term recovery.” Earl Thiessen, executive director, Oxford House Foundation of Canada   “It’s important now more than ever that we support our communities to recover. When Albertans recover, not only are they better for it but so are our families. This will ensure that families and community are at the centre of the process so that everyone recovers.” Lerena Greig, executive director, Parents Empowering Parents (PEP) Society   “This investment in recovery communities that focus on long-term health and wellness will help change lives of hundreds of Albertans. Evidence-based comprehensive care combined with support from peers in recovery will allow Albertans battling addiction to invest in their future, for themselves and their family.” Sheldon Bailey, person in recovery  Construction of these long-term residential treatment centres is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending, $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal, $200 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects, $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects, $500 million in municipal infrastructure and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL.

This is simply untrue. The AMA knows full well that an offer on a $5.4-billion budget of taxpayer money requires language that commits both parties to a shared goal, keeping spending within the budget target. “We have unfortunately seen hollow promises from the AMA before. In 2016, the former government signed a deal with the AMA that they claimed would save $500 million over two years. In reality, annual spending on physicians went up by more than $1 billion by 2018 – a 23 per cent increase. “Second, the AMA suggests that funding for programs and grants such as maternity and paternity benefits and physician health programming is in jeopardy. I want to be absolutely clear: funding for those benefits will not only be maintained but increased. We will do so by streamlining the administration of these dollars, making sure that every dollar available reaches Alberta’s physicians. “Physician spending represents 10 per cent of the total provincial budget and is forecasted to grow by billions if we do nothing. This is at the same time that COVID-19 and the Russian-Saudi oil price war are severely affecting government revenues, as well as most Albertans’ take-home pay.

Several measures will strengthen Indigenous participation in Alberta’s $1-billion Site Rehabilitation Program (SRP). This includes appointing an Indigenous liaison to help facilitate Indigenous participation in the program, and establishing an ongoing working group with Indigenous communities and companies. The working group will strengthen relationships between Indigenous-owned or operated oil field service contractors and Indigenous communities with oil and gas sites on their lands and surrounding areas. The working group includes about 50 participants, with more joining all the time, including Backwoods Energy Services, an oil field service company owned by the Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation. Through the first round of the SRP, Backwoods Energy has been approved to conduct closure work on 55 sites on Enoch Cree Nation. Another Indigenous comapny, Western Petroleum Management, was approved to conduct work on 257 sites across the province. Further Indigenous involvement is expected in subsequent rounds of the two-year SRP.  “First Nations must be a part of Alberta’s economic recovery from the COVID recession. The billion dollar Site Rehabilitation Program is an important part of the Alberta Recovery Plan. It will create thousands of jobs, and help to save energy service companies during this crisis in the oil and gas industry. We’re doing everything we can to ensure that Indigenous Albertans participate in this program, as workers, contractors and by cleaning up abandoned wells on First Nations Reserves.” Jason Kenney, Premier  In late 2019, Alberta’s government established the Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation to make it easier for Indigenous communities to access funding, invest in major natural resource development projects and fuel their prosperity while helping to grow Alberta’s natural resource sectors.  “This unprecedented collaboration between government, First Nations and industry, that benefits all peoples, is what our common ancestors had in mind when Treaty Six was signed.” Grand Chief Billy Morin, Confederacy of Treaty Six First Nations, and Chief of Enoch Cree Nation   “As majority shareholder of Backwoods Energy Services, we are pleased to see the investment into Indigenous communities as well as the partnership between Enoch Cree Nation, the Site Rehabilitation Program and Backwoods Energy. The program provides important initial funding to clean up well sites throughout Alberta and within Alexis Traditional Territory.” Chief Tony Alexis, Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation   “It’s encouraging to see companies like Backwoods and hundreds of others get back in the field to do the skilled work that Alberta’s energy sector is known for. This program will get thousands of Albertans working again and will accelerate our clean-up and reclamation efforts. We continue to make enhancements to the program. With $900 million left to distribute, we will ensure the program’s positive impacts reach across the province.” Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy   “Meaningful participation in energy projects is a game-changer for Indigenous businesses and communities. The response we are hearing from Indigenous communities to this program is overwhelmingly positive and we are looking forward to helping them become the economic powerhouses we all know they can be.” Rick Wilson, Minister of Indigenous Relations  Since its launch on May 1, $69 million has been allocated to 140 companies through the Site Rehabilitation Program. This will create more than 300 of the approximately 5,300 jobs the program is expected to create. The program provides grants to get oil field service workers, biologists, chemists, engineers, foresters and geoscience technologists back to work cleaning up oil and gas sites across the province.

The new regulations support more timely and appropriate access to emergency medical services by allowing stretcher vans and other vehicles to safely respond to non-urgent patient needs, keeping ambulances available for more critical situations.  “Regulating more vehicles means faster care for Albertans who require in-home medical treatment and assistance from community paramedics. They will not need to wait for a traditional ambulance when they don’t need one. Rural health professionals have been calling for these improvements, and we’re proud to make them happen.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health  The regulation updates also maximize the roles for nurse practitioners and paramedics, allowing nurse practitioners to now work as medical directors and provide real-time medical advice to paramedics during emergency medical events. Emergency medical service providers and operators were consulted and support these new regulations that provide greater flexibility to respond to Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as in the years ahead as best practices evolve.   “We welcome these changes that support the EMS system now and into the future. When we get a call, our team can assess if an alternate form of transport is appropriate or even if the patient’s needs are better met by referring someone like a community paramedic to them.” Darren Sandbeck, chief paramedic and senior provincial director, Alberta Health Services, Emergency Medical Services   “We appreciate regulatory changes that support Albertans who choose to access medical care in their homes. Now patients know that when they call a paramedic to help, it won’t necessarily mean taking an ambulance off the road.” Ryan Kozicky, director, EMS Mobile Integrated Health Care, Community Paramedicine  The new emergency vehicles have the same identification, licensing, registration and safety requirements as traditional ambulances, including regular inspections and maintenance. Quick facts  AHS Emergency Medical Services responds to more than 550,000 events across the province annually. Ground ambulance legislation establishes standards for:  	 patient care practitioner training equipment use and maintenance how patient information is passed between care providers   All new classes of vehicles will be owned or registered to a licensed ambulance operator and approved for use by Alberta Health.  	 Inspection and maintenance costs will be offset by the lower operational costs of more fuel-efficient vehicles.

Masks are now available at more than 700 partner restaurant locations, including those without drive-thru service, adding more than 100 new locations and expanding the availability of masks to Albertans. No purchase is necessary to pick up masks in restaurants, either at the counter or through drive-thrus. A&W, McDonald’s Canada, and Tim Hortons partner restaurants are handing out eight masks per person for this distribution. Albertans are encouraged to pick up masks for family and friends to reduce traffic at partner restaurant locations. Masks will be available at restaurants while supplies last.  “Albertans don’t shy away from hard work when there is a job to do. Right now, it’s our job to continue to do the work needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as our province relaunches. Washing your hands regularly, practising physical distancing, and wearing a mask when physical distancing isn’t possible will help keep us all safe.” Jason Kenney, Premier  A larger number of long-term care and supportive living, seniors facilities, community groups, social service organizations, libraries, court houses and places of worship will be distributing masks to their residents, clients and members. Municipalities without easy access to a partner restaurant location are again being supplied with masks to distribute to their residents, as are First Nations communities and Metis Settlements.   Four million masks are being provided to 20 transit systems across Alberta, including Calgary and Edmonton, to be used by transit riders. 7-Eleven Canada has generously donated logistics support to ship and deliver these masks and distribution supplies from the government warehouse to each participating transit service. Wearing a non-medical mask when it's difficult to maintain physical distancing of two metres is one way we can continue to limit the spread of COVID-19 as we relaunch our province. This initiative is a key part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely reopen our economy while protecting Albertans from COVID-19.  “This is the only initiative of its kind in Canada and it’s a key support to our safe relaunch. Like other provinces, we strongly recommend people follow public health advice on distancing, and wear a mask when that’s not possible. And we’re the only province in Canada that’s backing up that advice with free masks to socialize their use. Thank you to our partners A&W, McDonald’s Canada, and Tim Hortons for again stepping up to support us – and to 7-Eleven Canada for volunteering to ship masks to transit services. And, of course, thanks to municipalities, First Nations and Metis communities, places of worship, social services organizations, seniors facilities and others who are helping us get masks to as many Albertans as possible.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health   “We were very pleased with how smoothly the first distribution went and are ready to go again. We know from our guests that Albertans want the masks and we are very pleased to be able to help the government in this way.” Susan Senecal, president and CEO, A&W Canada   “McDonald’s Canada will continue to partner with the Alberta government to distribute masks in our drive-thrus and now, in our restaurants. We look forward to welcoming all Albertans back into our restaurants as we safely reopen across the province for both take-out and dine-in.” Jeff Kroll, restaurant support officer and COVID Response lead, McDonald’s Canada   “Tim Hortons and its restaurant owners were excited and honoured to support the distribution of free masks to Albertans last month. We look forward to the second phase, when we’ll also be offering masks at the counter inside our restaurants as well as in our drive-thrus. Tim Hortons is proud of how restaurant owners and team members have stepped up to help Alberta move forward with its recovery plan.” Mike Hancock, chief operating officer, Tim Hortons   “7-Eleven Canada is proud to volunteer the shipping and logistics support necessary to bring millions of masks to transit services and their riders across Alberta. We hope that our contribution to the government’s Masks for Albertans program will help Albertans get to their destination and home again safely wherever transit takes them.""  Norman Hower, vice-president and general manager, 7-Eleven Canada  Quick facts  Mask use is not mandatory; they are an option for situations where maintaining a distance of two metres is not possible. This program is intended to supplement an individual’s own efforts to acquire non-medical masks. Albertans who wish to use non-medical masks are encouraged to purchase their own supply from local retailers in addition to using those provided by government. From the supply of 20 million masks:  	 Nine million are being distributed by partner restaurants.  Four million are being provided to 20 municipal transit system operators, including Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton, primarily for distribution to transit users.   		 7-Eleven Canada is providing logistics support to ship non-medical masks to transit system operators across the province.   2.5 million have been provided to places of worship. 900,000 are going to long-term care and seniors facilities. 800,000 are going to First Nations communities and Metis Settlements. 500,000 are going to communities without easy access to restaurants.  1.5 million are being offered to social services organizations to support vulnerable Albertans. 500,000 are going to court houses for distribution to the public attending court proceedings. 300,000 are held in reserve for communities that may experience outbreaks and require additional masks.   Municipalities, First Nations communities and Metis Settlements, transit services, places of worship, long-term care, seniors facilities and all participating service organizations will develop their own distribution programs and timelines. There are several locations for each restaurant partner that are unable to participate due to their small size limiting their ability to store masks, or the fact they are located inside a separate business or facility such as a Walmart, shopping mall or hospital food court. Restaurants that are still closed due to COVID-19 restrictions do not have masks available. Restaurants will provide eight masks per person – this may come in two packs of four, or in one pack of eight. Contact Alberta 211 for assistance if you cannot access a restaurant partner or access masks through alternate municipal or community providers. Alberta 211 is a community service partner supporting the distribution of masks. Any concerns or complaints about the distribution of masks should be directed to the feedback form on alberta.ca/masks.

Alberta Education is enhancing financial literacy in classrooms through grant partnerships with Enriched Academy and Junior Achievement chapters in Alberta. These organizations have established programming that is aligned with provincial curriculum and can be delivered across the province in rural and urban settings for students from diverse backgrounds, including Indigenous and Francophone students.  “Financial literacy is an essential skill our children need to succeed. The Enriched Academy pilot and Junior Achievement expansion give school authorities and teachers more program options this fall to choose from to ensure students achieve essential learning outcomes.” Adriana LaGrange, Minister of Education  Enriched Academy Through a $175,000 grant, Enriched Academy will pilot an online financial education program for Grades 10-12 students. The pilot will happen during the 2020-21 school year, and include teachers and up to 4,000 students.  “We are excited to help empower teachers across Alberta to help students learn these essential life skills to manage their money. Given the economic uncertainty today, there has never been a more critical time for all of us to understand saving, budgeting and investing. I want to commend the Alberta government and the educators involved for taking such a proactive approach toward teaching financial literacy.” Kevin Cochran, president and co-founder, Enriched Academy  School authorities can find out how to participate in the pilot on the Enriched Academy Alberta Pilot Project website. The pilot includes in-person training and resources for teachers, as well as interactive bilingual online courses, tools, webinars and live events for students and educators. All teachers and students in the pilot program will receive lifetime access to the Enriched Academy program. Enriched Academy is a Canadian organization that provides financial education to more than 100,000 people of all ages through online courses, coaching and live events. They have a proven track record of working with students at both secondary and post-secondary levels, including a partnership with the District School Board of Niagara in Ontario, and by offering their program to high school students across Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Junior Achievement A $200,000 grant will enable Junior Achievement’s Southern Alberta and Northern Alberta chapters to collaborate on providing 4,500 more students with hands-on, experiential financial literacy, work readiness and entrepreneurship education.  “Junior Achievement is pleased to receive this support from government to increase financial literacy education to students across Alberta. JA has worked hard to provide experiential entrepreneurship, financial literacy and work readiness training in this province as a community-driven charity for over 60 years. This funding will support JA’s continued efforts to expand its reach so more students in rural and Indigenous communities can develop skills that are vital to thrive in our modern global economy.” Melissa From, CEO, Junior Achievement Southern Alberta  To facilitate this expansion, Junior Achievement will tap into its network of community organizations, volunteers and employees in more than 120 Alberta communities. During the 2020-21 school year, they will be able to serve more than 49,000 students from Grades 3-12. School authorities can find out how to access this programming by contacting JA Southern Alberta or JA Northern Alberta and Northwest Territories. Junior Achievement is the world’s largest non-government organization dedicated to educating young people about business. There are more than 120 member organizations globally, which enables them to give youth a world business view, along with the skills and confidence to become leaders of tomorrow.

Due to low population density and medical availability in the Northwest Territories, residents who die there cannot donate their organs and tissues. Patients requiring critical care are often transported to a hospital in Alberta, yet were not previously included in the Alberta registry. A new agreement allows consenting residents of the Northwest Territories to be considered for donation if they are in a hospital in Alberta and pass away in a manner that makes their organs or tissues eligible.  “This agreement will help shorten the organ and tissue waiting lists and improve the chances of a match for those in need. By working together, our governments are expanding the pool of potential donors, improving health and saving lives. I continue to encourage all residents in Alberta to register their wish to become organ donors.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health   “Providing N.W.T. residents with the option to register their consent for organ and tissue donation is a long-standing commitment of our government that is now possible through this agreement with Alberta. I am pleased that this option is now available and I encourage residents to register.” Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services, Government of Northwest Territories  Under the agreement, Alberta’s health-care teams can now access the registry to see if a patient from the Northwest Territories provided their consent to donate. The agreement includes measures to ensure that an individual’s personal information and privacy are respected and protected at all times.

L to R: John Fehr, board chair, Northern Lights Gas Co-op, Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and Dan Williams, MLA of Peace-River, announce support for rural utilities in La Crete.  One of the key strategic projects under Alberta’s Recovery Plan, this grant of at least $16 million will support construction of 92 kilometres of six-inch high-pressure natural gas supply line from the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. Wolverine River Lateral pipeline northeast of Peace River north to La Crete.  “This project provides a secure, sustainable source of clean energy for the region, supporting agriculture and the rural economy as we work to recover from COVID-19. The new supply line is essential to meet the rural natural gas demand of this growing economic region of Alberta.” Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry  The project will benefit the entire region, ensuring an uninterrupted supply of natural gas. Northern Lights Gas Co-op will also benefit from an increased customer base, as the new supply line will allow them to serve large industrial customers.  “This additional gas line will be a more reliable and secure source of natural gas that is less vulnerable to freezing and supply loss during the winter. Adding a new pipeline is the only viable long-term solution to improve the integrity of the current natural gas supply system.” John Fehr, board chair, Northern Lights Gas Co-op Ltd.  The co-op is a local not-for-profit organization and the grant supports a more efficient and stable energy supply for Alberta’s most northern farming communities. The supply line is expected to be operational in 2022.  “The Peace River Constituency is leading the province in our Alberta Recovery Plan. This pipeline not only provides the basic infrastructure every Albertan deserves, like the guarantee of a warm home in a frigid northern winter, it will also create jobs for local residents and diversify our provincial economy with more opportunity for growth. After years of economic and energy insecurity, the UCP government is delivering for Albertans.” Dan Williams, MLA for Peace River  The economic benefits of the project include the creation of about 50 construction jobs. The project also makes the region more attractive to industrial employers who need access to a reliable source of natural gas.  “Having experienced numerous homes lose all heat several times due to insufficient gas supply while schools and industry were forced to shut down and senior homes and the hospital had to connect to propane, this news couldn’t come at a better time.” Josh Knelsen, reeve, Mackenzie County  Designed to improve long-term sustainability, this additional supply line is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending, $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal, $200 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects, $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects, $500 million in municipal infrastructure and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL. Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and return investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada. Quick facts  The population of Mackenzie County has grown by more than 20 per cent since 2003. Northern Lights Gas Co-op has been providing natural gas service to rural residents in Mackenzie County since 1980 and currently has about 4,000 members. Most rural Albertans receive natural gas service through either member co-ops of the Federation of Alberta Gas Co-ops Ltd. or the gas utilities (AltaGas Utilities Inc. or ATCO).

Government will spend $6.21 million to redevelop the James Murray Building and $15.16 million to expand the Lachlin McKinnon Building and Animal Health Technology labs at Olds College. Both projects will result in more state-of-the-art spaces for students and researchers. It will also give dozens of Albertans consistent, well-paying jobs – a key government priority under Alberta’s Recovery Plan. The comprehensive renewal and renovation of the existing Lachlin McKinnon Building and Animal Health Technology labs will expand and revitalize the Animal Health Education Centre, helping the college address anticipated program growth and enrolment. The redevelopment and expansion of the James Murray Building will allow the college to create a new ag-tech learning hub, which promises to be a world leader in integrated agricultural, technological and data sciences learning experiences. Students and researchers will be able to partner with industry personnel to develop new technology for smart and sustainable agriculture.  “This investment is a key part of our government’s economic recovery plan. Olds College has long been a valuable source of innovation for Alberta’s agriculture sector as well as a driving force for the regional economy in central Alberta. This investment will give students and researchers more access to cutting-edge facilities and help solidify the college’s place as a world-leader in its field.”   Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education   “Alberta’s Recovery Plan focuses on infrastructure as a critical component for supporting economic growth and jobs for Albertans. This includes investing in shovel-ready projects to upgrade and maintain public facilities, like this post-secondary institution, that help keep Albertans working and stimulate local economies where it matters most.” Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure   “Agriculture is without a doubt the most important industry in our region. Our farm families are leaders in adopting new ideas and technology. Expanding and modernizing Olds College, supporting more students and researchers, will only help drive our industry forward.” Nathan Cooper, MLA for Olds-Didsbury-Three Hills   “Olds College is thrilled that the Government of Alberta is contributing nearly $21.4 million in funding toward two critical projects that will ensure Alberta’s economy has the labour and talent needed to thrive. The first project will support our Animal Health Education Centre, which will result in a 67 per cent increase in capacity for animal health programming at the college. The second project will make our Ag-Tech Learning Hub a reality, which will house the Werklund School of Agriculture Technology and new programming that is coming online this fall. Designed as a high-tech learning environment, the Ag-Tech Learning Hub will connect to in-field technologies at the Olds College Smart Farm, as well as to Alberta farmers and partners throughout the globe. Olds College is thankful for the support of the Alberta government and their co-investment toward both projects by our many generous donors and industry partners.” Stuart Cullum, president, Olds College   ""The Students' Association of Olds College would like to thank the Government of Alberta for their investment into the future of agriculture and our students. The commitment of $21.3 million of the Capital Maintenance and Renewal Stimulus Fund will greatly improve the academic and social learning environments for all of our students. As well, it shows the government's commitment to supporting our agricultural industry in the new technological age."" Michael Frankiw, president, Students’ Association of Olds College   ""The Alberta Students' Executive Council thanks the Government of Alberta for their commitment of $98 million from the Capital Maintenance and Renewal Stimulus Fund. This investment comes at an important time for Alberta's institutions and our economy, a fact well recognized by our university, college, and polytechnic student members. ASEC supports this supplemental capital funding, and remains committed to working with the government in building a modern post-secondary system in Alberta."" Emmanauel Barker, director, public relations and advocacy, Alberta Students' Executive Council  Funding for the Olds College projects is part of an additional $98-million commitment to post-secondary institutions for accelerated capital maintenance and renewal, which is expected to create about 533 full-time jobs around the province. This investment in Olds College demonstrates government’s commitment to support rural communities and provide high-quality learning opportunities to attract students from across the province. Budget 2020 already includes $118.5 million for capital maintenance and renewal at colleges, universities and polytechnics. In April, the Alberta government announced it was accelerating the capital plan and increasing capital maintenance and renewal spending in 2020-21 to almost $2 billion. Advanced Education worked with post-secondary institutions to identify projects, with a focus on addressing existing maintenance issues, ensuring compliance with building codes and regulations, increasing access to services, and reducing operational costs. Government also prioritized projects that will help create jobs, and are ready for work to begin. The Olds College renewal project is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan.

He went on to serve with distinction as Minister for Youth and Minister of Education.  “Following the election of the Lougheed government, Bob became Leader of the Opposition in 1973, and continued to represent the constituency of Olds-Didsbury until 1981. As both a government and opposition member, Bob was respected by members of all parties, and was considered a true gentleman with a real heart for public service. “That same dedication to Alberta led him to serve as the province’s first ever ethics commissioner, and later the first privacy and information commissioner. He volunteered in countless roles, including for three terms as chairman of the board of Olds College, and chairman of the board of the Alberta Junior A Hockey League. “He was always a passionate voice for his constituents, agriculture, and our parliamentary institutions. “On behalf of the Government of Alberta, I offer my sincere condolences to Bob Clark’s family, loved ones and friends, and the entire community of Olds at this time of loss.”  Media inquiries                                               Harrison Fleming                                           780-984-3543 Deputy Press Secretary, Office of the Premier    "

Since 2015, five million tonnes of emissions have been safely captured and stored as part of its Quest facility – the equivalent of the annual emissions from about 1.25 million vehicles. “The facility represents the first application of CCS technology at an oil sands upgrader, and highlights both the energy sector’s dedication to technological innovation, and our government’s commitment to responsible energy development. “This achievement could not have been accomplished without the significant investment and vision of former premier Ed Stelmach, whose commitment to commercial carbon capture and storage projects led to more than $1.2 billion in government support. “Today, Alberta is a global leader in this game-changing technology that provides exciting opportunities in many areas, including the development of clean-burning blue hydrogen. “Our energy is produced under the world’s highest environmental, human rights and labour standards. Alberta has long been committed to a sensible approach to greenhouse gas reductions, including following through on major investments in CCS technology, being the first jurisdiction in North America to place a price on carbon for all large emitters across all sectors, implementing significant methane emissions reductions regulations, and supporting Alberta-made technologies through our Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction system. “But we know the world is watching and investors expect us to continue to build on our substantive accomplishments. Canada – led by Alberta – ranks third among oil-producing nations in environmental, social and governance, or ESG, factors. And, as we’ve highlighted in Alberta’s Recovery Plan, we have every intention of strengthening these efforts. Thanks to our industry’s experience in CCS and other emerging technologies, Alberta is well-positioned to diversify our energy mix by exploring new less emissions-intensive opportunities, such as blue hydrogen and geothermal development. “I’m also pleased that Shell has announced that they are proceeding with a significant turnaround over the next few months. At its peak, the turnaround will create jobs for 3,800 workers per day, helping to stimulate economic recovery – while safeguarding the health and well-being of its employees. “Thank you to Shell for taking the time to share their successes, and I encourage other producers to do the same.

They’ve never taken bargaining seriously. In years past, the AMA 'promised' savings, only to see actual billings come in billions of dollars higher than what they promised. This is not sustainable. “The AMA needs to stop playing games, and start taking the economic crisis facing this province and this country seriously. We’re still offering to hold our spending at the highest level in Canada, and frankly that commitment is looking more generous by the day, considering the fiscal situation in this province and this country.

The statement of defence, filed today in the Court of Queen’s Bench, outlines that government implemented a new physician funding framework only after engaging in good faith, meaningful negotiations and consultation.    “Alberta’s economy has been devastated over the past five years and our budget has faced shortfalls as a result. Our goal throughout negotiations was to simply hold the line on cost overruns while maintaining spending at the highest level ever. Alberta’s negotiators worked hard and in good faith to arrive at an acceptable agreement that would still ensure that Alberta’s doctors would be the highest-paid physicians in all of Canada. We believe this claim is groundless and we look forward to a timely resolution.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health  The statement of defence makes clear the following facts:  The AMA was not prepared for negotiations and did not table any proposals until well into the process. Alberta Health responded to each proposal once they were presented and offered amendments to accommodate the AMA’s interests. Following mediation, the parties agreed that negotiations were at an impasse. Government chose to use the clause in the agreement that allowed for the agreement to be ended by either party. The AMA agreed to include this clause in the agreement and was fully aware of government’s ability to exercise it. Physicians are not employees of the ministry.

Seniors and Housing Minister Josephine Pon welcomed the panel to its first meeting. Panel Chair Mickey Amery, MLA for Calgary-Cross, will lead the 10-member panel that will provide recommendations to transform Alberta’s affordable housing system.  Seniors and Housing Minister Josephine Pon has appointed 10 experts to an independent panel, led by MLA Mickey Amery, to conduct a review that will provide recommendations to transform affordable housing. Through this review, the panel will identify ways to make the affordable housing system better serve Albertans in need as well as make more efficient use of taxpayer dollars.  “Our government knows Alberta’s affordable housing system must be financially sustainable and able to address growing demand. This review is the foundational piece of our housing transformation work. I thank the panel members for agreeing to spend their valuable time and effort to make housing more affordable and accessible. Their recommendations will help inform a new vision for affordable housing in Alberta.” Josephine Pon, Minister of Seniors and Housing   “It is an honour to chair the Affordable Housing Review Panel and have the opportunity to work with this outstanding group of experts. Over the coming months, as we hear from diverse groups and dig into research, we will be challenged to think creatively about ways government can better provide housing for Albertans in need. We have much work ahead and I am eager to get started.” Mickey Amery, chair, Affordable Housing Review Panel, and MLA for Calgary-Cross  Panel members bring a diverse range of expertise and backgrounds as housing providers, developers and civil society organizations to identify innovative solutions for Albertans in need of housing. The panel will also receive submissions on populations most in need of affordable housing. Specifically, the panel will consider:  The role the Government of Alberta plays in providing affordable housing. Simplifying or easing regulatory structures that create costs and red tape for housing providers. Gaps in the current affordable housing system. Innovative approaches that will enable government and its partners to meet increasing demand for affordable housing.  The Affordable Housing Review Panel members are:  Mickey Amery, chair – MLA for Calgary-Cross Paul Boskovich – president, Genstar Development Company Lauren Ingalls – chief administrative officer, Westwinds Communities Jeffrey Johnson – consultant and former Alberta MLA and cabinet minister Sam Kolias – co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer, Boardwalk REIT Javaid (Jerry) Naqvi – chairman and founder, Cameron Development Corporation Marcia Nelson – executive fellow, University of Calgary Raymond Swonek – chief executive officer, GEF Seniors Housing Dr. Sasha Tsenkova – professor, University of Calgary Rachelle Venne – chief executive officer, Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women  To ensure physical distancing, members will rely on virtual technology to facilitate meetings, presentations and engagement, where possible. The panel will hear from groups that are interested in affordable housing. These groups include seniors, Indigenous Peoples, newcomers, people experiencing homelessness, and people with disabilities.  “I feel privileged to help shape the future of the province’s affordable housing system in order to sustain this critical resource. In this economic juncture, housing is more important than ever. I applaud the province for taking steps to review a program that has been evolving since 1958 to ensure it supports housing needs of vulnerable families, seniors and individuals with special needs, while supporting growing demands for innovative housing solutions.” Lauren Ingalls, chief administrative officer, Westwinds Communities   “Affordable housing is essential for competitive and resilient communities. During the current pandemic, it shelters Albertans from economic shocks, provides a place to work, learn and recover from social stress. The ecosystem of affordable housing providers requires resources, commitment and innovative strategies to address growing housing challenges.” Dr. Sasha Tsenkova, professor, University of Calgary   “Affordable housing is critical to building safe, inclusive Alberta communities. Housing has been documented often as a critical component to improving the lives of Indigenous women, most recently in the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. I look forward to participating in the Affordable Housing Review Panel with this view in mind.” Rachelle Venne, chief executive officer, Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women   “On behalf of Cameron Corporation, I am proud to be selected by Minister Pon to be part of the Affordable Housing Review Panel. From our perspective as an immigrant family and an Edmonton-based developer for 40 years, we understand the need to build a community everyone can enjoy, and one in which we all feel accepted. I look forward to working hard alongside my fellow panel members and partner organizations to continue making Alberta accessible for all.” Jerry Naqvi, chairman and founder, Cameron Development Corporation  The panel’s final report will be submitted to Minister Pon by Sept. 30. Quick facts  Currently, more than 110,000 Albertans live in affordable housing. Almost a half-million Albertans spend more than 30 per cent of their household income on rent, which is the standard for affordability. More than 19,000 households are currently on waiting lists for affordable housing.

The district heating and cooling centre is located in the iconic University Hall building, which first opened in 1971. An upgraded district heating and cooling centre is critical to the continued operation and viability of the vast majority of the current campus. Student residences, academic spaces and research labs will all benefit from a more efficient and functional system. It will also give dozens of Albertans consistent, well-paying jobs – a key government priority under Alberta’s Recovery Plan. Funding for the University of Lethbridge project is part of an additional $98-million commitment to post-secondary institutions for accelerated capital maintenance and renewal, which is expected to create about 533 full-time jobs around the province.  “The University of Lethbridge is one of the top research universities of its kind, and it’s also a strong pillar of the regional economy. This funding will not only guarantee a high-quality campus experience for years to come, it will also help many Albertans in the Lethbridge area find gainful employment and provide for their families.” Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education   “Alberta’s Recovery Plan focuses on infrastructure as a critical component for supporting economic growth and jobs for Albertans. This includes investing in shovel-ready projects to upgrade and maintain public facilities, like this post-secondary institution, that help keep Albertans working and stimulate local economies where it matters most.” Prasad Panda, Minister of Infrastructure   “Our government is working to make smart and responsible investments. This new capital maintenance funding for the University of Lethbridge – funding that has been deferred for over a decade – is a welcome influx of capital to Lethbridge. This is spending that will benefit students, help control the cost of future maintenance to the university, and will also help the community by ensuring that well-calculated and focused projects are creating jobs right here in Lethbridge.” Nathan Neudorf, MLA for Lethbridge-East   ""The investment in a new energy centre at the University of Lethbridge not only creates immediate employment, but will lower our carbon footprint and provide ongoing operational savings through energy efficiency. This new plant and supporting infrastructure will reliably meet the heating and cooling requirements for approximately 80 per cent of our campus buildings."" Mike Mahon, president and vice-chancellor, University of Lethbridge  Budget 2020 already includes $118.5 million for capital maintenance and renewal at colleges, universities and polytechnics. In April, the Alberta government announced it was accelerating the capital plan and increasing capital maintenance and renewal spending in 2020-21 to almost $2 billion. Advanced Education worked with post-secondary institutions to identify projects, with a focus on addressing existing maintenance issues, ensuring compliance with building codes and regulations, increasing access to services, and reducing operational costs. Government also prioritized projects that will help create jobs, and are ready for work to begin. The University of Lethbridge project is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending, $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal, $200 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects, $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects, $500 million in municipal infrastructure and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL. Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and returns investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada.

The Alberta Petrochemicals Incentive Program, part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan, will bring multi-billion dollar investments to petrochemical projects throughout Alberta, helping to strengthen and diversify the province’s economy and create new jobs for Albertans. The current global health crisis has highlighted the importance of petrochemical manufacturing around the world. Petrochemical facilities make the building blocks required for everyday consumer and professional items like medical equipment, computers and cellphones, personal protective equipment like rubber gloves and masks, car seats and tires, and fertilizer for agriculture and home gardening. Alberta is already among Canada’s largest hubs for petrochemicals manufacturing, and with global demand for petrochemicals expected to continue to increase, there is a significant opportunity for Albertans and the province to expand this sector. For example, Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Association estimates there could be a further $30 billion of private-sector investment in the province’s petrochemical sector by 2030.  “While Alberta is already a Canadian leader in petrochemicals manufacturing, the sky is the limit for this sector’s benefits to our province. Over the last 10 years, petrochemical investment in the United States reached $250 billion, more than 10 times what was invested in Canada. With our affordable 300-year supply of natural gas, technically skilled and educated workforce, and respected innovation and research sectors, Alberta is ready to seize the opportunity to become a global destination for petrochemical manufacturing, benefiting all Albertans.” Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity  Compared to previous government petrochemical programs, the Alberta Petrochemicals Incentive Program will cut red tape and increase certainty and flexibility for investors, attracting more financial investment into Alberta’s petrochemicals sector. Key features include:  A 10-year program period during which eligible projects must be built and operational. Adopting an open and transparent funding process, whereby every project that meets the program’s criteria will receive funding once built and operational. Government will no longer pick winners and losers through a private evaluation process.  Grants – instead of royalty credits – to be issued to companies after eligible projects are operational. In the current economic climate, grants are the most effective way to attract investment. Grants allow companies to better account for the full value of the incentive provided when calculating their project’s return on investment.   Making the funds available throughout the program’s duration once the facilities are in service, in order to align with typical business investment cycles.   “The Alberta Petrochemicals Incentive Program will have a significant impact on enhancing the competitiveness of Alberta when attracting large-scale, value-add investments, relative to other global jurisdictions. This program, coupled with the other tremendous competitive advantages that Alberta’s Industrial Heartland has to offer, including world-leading carbon capture and storage infrastructure, will stimulate job-creating economic activity that will benefit all Albertans and all Canadians.” Mark Plamondon, executive director, Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Association   ""Alberta is leading the way on economic recovery. The Alberta Petrochemicals Incentive Program shows that the province understands how to win global-scale chemistry sector investments. In this time of uncertainty, these actions signal confidence in Alberta’s future prosperity and will attract investors to the province.” Bob Masterson, president and CEO, Chemistry Industry Association of Canada   ""Resource Diversification Council member companies commend the Government of Alberta for its bold action introducing a broad-ranging jobs creation program that is intended to attract significant new investment to the Alberta economy, including in the petrochemical sector. Government support is critical to level the playing field with other economic competitors that are aggressively courting investment, especially during these challenging times. Other jurisdictions are doing all that they can to attract investment and the RDC is encouraged to see Alberta sharpen its competitive focus to bring long-term benefit to Albertans.” David Chappell, board chair, Resource Diversification Council  Government will work with industry over the summer to finalize the program guidelines. More details about eligibility, process, governance and reporting requirements will be available when the program is officially launched in early fall. Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and return investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada. Quick facts  Alberta has the most established and potential growth for petrochemical manufacturing centres in Canada through Alberta’s Industrial Heartland, Grande Prairie, Joffre and Medicine Hat. Every day, people around the world use dozens of products that are made with petrochemicals, including:  	 Medical supplies, such as computers for X-rays and MRIs and personal protective equipment, including disposable masks and gloves Polyester fabric couches, HD televisions, phones, bicycle helmets, coffeemakers and computers Car tires, engine hoses, gasoline, radio components and AUX cords, and car seats Desks, chairs, computers, carpets, cellphones and other office supplies Food packaging that keeps food fresh and safe during transport and storage   According to the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, Alberta’s chemicals sector, comprised predominantly of petrochemicals, was valued at $12.1 billion and employed about 58,400 people directly and indirectly in 2019. According to Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Association, there is an opportunity to grow Alberta’s petrochemical sector by more than $30 billion by 2030, resulting in more than 90,000 direct and indirect jobs over the construction and operation periods of new facilities, and more than $10 billion in revenue for the Government of Alberta from corporate and personal income taxes.

The work will include widening Terwillegar Drive from Rabbit Hill Road to and across Anthony Henday Drive to Windermere Boulevard, building a second overpass over Anthony Henday Drive, and making intersection improvements at 23 Avenue and Haddow Drive. This work will support about 865 jobs for Albertans. The investment will help drive the economic recovery in the province by moving traffic more efficiently in southwest Edmonton – the fastest-growing part of Alberta’s capital city – and the entire capital region.  “This investment in Terwillegar Drive will help support Alberta’s Recovery Plan by ensuring families and businesses can get around faster and safer. I look forward to seeing work get underway on this project, which will create hundreds off jobs and pave the way for economic development in Edmonton for generations to come.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “As a resident of southwest Edmonton who drives these roads every single day, I know how critical this investment is to the overall quality of life for Edmonton families and businesses. Our government recognizes that Edmonton will play a critical role in the economic recovery of our province, which is why we’re investing in completing the expansion of Terwillegar Drive in southwest Edmonton. We’re walking the talk with serious investments in Alberta’s capital city.” Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs   “I am ecstatic to see that phase two for the Terwillegar Drive expansion is receiving funding. Between the City of Edmonton’s funding of phase one and the Government of Alberta’s funding of phase two, the entire length of Terwillegar Drive will finally be fully upgraded. The residents of southwest Edmonton have been waiting for this for over 30 years and I look forward to seeing shovels in the ground on this project in 2021.” Tim Cartmell, Ward 9 councillor, City of Edmonton   “This announcement couldn’t come at a better time. Infrastructure investments like this one provide much-needed stimulus by injecting capital into our economy and the creation of good jobs. We’re pleased to see the province and the city working together on the long-awaited enhancements to Terwillegar Drive, which will ensure we move our people and products more efficiently and effectively.” Janet Riopel, president and CEO, Edmonton Chamber of Commerce.  As Edmonton’s south side continues to grow, completing the expansion of Terwillegar Drive will make it easier to get into and out of the community, especially during the busy morning and evening commutes. Designed to improve long-term productivity, the project is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending, $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal, $200 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects, $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects, $500 million in municipal infrastructure and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL.

Quick facts  Alberta Transportation is providing up to $120 million in funding to the City of Edmonton for this project. The work will include:  	 Widening Terwillegar Drive from Rabbit Hill Road to and across Anthony Henday Drive to Windermere Boulevard to four lanes in each direction (this will include a dedicated transit lane). Building a second overpass over Anthony Henday Drive. Making intersection improvements at 23 Avenue and Haddow Drive. Building a multi-use trail on the east boulevard of Terwillegar Drive. Building a pedestrian bridge, which will take the multi-use trail from Brookview to Brookside.   Between Monday and Friday, about 40,000 vehicles per day travel Terwillegar Drive.

Funding is provided for two projects in Edmonton: $8 million to renew and replace mechanical and electrical systems in the Brain and Aging Research Building, and another $8 million to install a new piping system to heat and cool the Tory Building. Both projects are ready to start and will create about 90 full-time jobs in Edmonton. Funding for the University of Alberta is part of an additional $98-million commitment to post-secondary institutions for accelerated capital maintenance and renewal, which is expected to create about 533 full-time jobs around the province. This work will extend the life cycle of both buildings and ensure post-secondary students and staff continue to have high-quality campus experiences. It will also give dozens of Albertans consistent, well-paying jobs – a key government priority under Alberta’s Recovery Plan.  “Our government is committed to developing world-class post-secondary institutions and today’s announcement of an additional $16 million will help us meet students’ evolving needs, give researchers new and better spaces to further their work, and make sure our campuses stay safe and welcoming places.

The upgrades and additions to the Brain and Aging Research Building will enhance one of our state-of-the-art facilities and help continue to facilitate groundbreaking scientific research for the benefit of all Albertans."" Bill Flanagan, president and vice-chancellor, University of Alberta  Planned upgrades in the Brain and Aging Research Building will support research labs throughout the building’s four floors, while also freeing up more research space on the upper floor. The Tory Building first opened in 1966, and many of its internal parts are original, so a new heating and cooling system will help avoid more costly maintenance in the future.

ASIRT’s investigation was comprehensive and thorough, conducted using current investigative protocols, and in accordance with the principles of Major Case Management (MCM). Numerous witnesses were interviewed, including civilian witnesses. The involved officer declined to provide a statement, as is his constitutional right. This investigation focused on the handling of a person in the midst of a mental health crisis. Investigation would show, however, that prior to the final incident, the man’s mental health had been markedly deteriorating and interventions had been attempted and failed, leading to the final confrontation. Days Leading Up to the Critical Incident At the time of his death, the 43-year-old man was approximately 191 cm tall (6’3”) and 101 kg (224 lbs) and had no prior criminal record. In 2015, he was the victim of an assault that resulted in some form of head injury. Friends and family expressed concerns about his declining mental health, which they attributed to this head injury. The man expressed anger towards police for failing to identify the perpetrators; however, there was no record that the matter had ever been reported to CPS. On January 21, 2018, the man called 911 and requested an ambulance. Police attended and the man told them he was “just messing around” and did not need assistance. As such, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were told that they were not needed. Shortly after, the man called a second time and requested assistance. Police again attended but requested the assistance of EMS on scene. The officers related that the man seemed to be caught in a verbal loop, repeating what sounded like “Bourne, Bourne, Bourne, 911, 911, 911, crickets, crickets, crickets.” He advised police that he was the reincarnation of Jennifer Aniston and told them, “All I want is for someone to tell me I am not insane.” Shortly after 11 p.m., CPS apprehended the man under the Mental Health Act and transported him to the South Health Centre. He was assessed and discharged. On January 24, 2018, the man spoke with his father and told him he was having mental health issues and that he was going to call 911 and get help. Around midnight, the man again called his father and indicated that he was at the hospital and asked his father to get him a lawyer because he felt the hospital was infringing on his rights. Later that day, the man’s father spoke to someone at the hospital who advised that he had been discharged shortly after 6 a.m., reportedly after a “good night’s sleep.” The father was advised that a doctor determined that there was no medical reason to keep him in hospital and there was no reason for him to see a psychologist. On January 25, 2018, the man’s father called 911 requesting assistance, indicating that he had spoken with his son, who “seemed out of it,” and that he was concerned that his son might engage in self-harm. CPS responded, but when they arrived on scene, EMS personnel were already present, having responded to the location on an unrelated call. EMS transported the man to the Rockyview Hospital. The father indicated that it was his understanding that he stayed for a few hours before he was once again discharged. The man next spoke to his father on the evening of January 26, 2018. The father reported that his son seemed more stable, and had told him he was at the casino, that he was tired and was going to get a hotel room. His son did make one cryptic statement to the effect that this was his “last night as a free man,” which he did not explain. This was, tragically, the last time that man would speak to his father. The Critical Incident At the time of the incident, the man resided at Grandel Manor, a two-storey apartment building located at 606 68 Avenue SW, in Calgary. The man lived on the second floor in an apartment that had a balcony to the rear of the building, overlooking the parking lot and back alley. On the night of January 27, 2018, the man and another resident of his building walked to a local pub for a drink. As they walked to the pub, the man ran into traffic, with the resident stating it seemed like he was “trying to get himself killed.” Once at the pub, a conflict with staff led to them leaving after one drink to return to the apartment building. At about 8:53 p.m., a neighbour called 911 to advise that the man was having some sort of “meltdown” or he was “on something.” The caller advised the man was yelling, screaming and throwing items from his apartment into the hallway. The caller advised that during a brief conversation with the man, he tried to give the caller his pet bearded dragon. The caller advised that this had been going on for about 10 minutes and they were fearful for their safety. At 8:59 p.m., the same resident who had earlier gone to the pub called 911 and advised that his friend was having “a breakdown.” He advised that the man had previously suffered a brain injury and he was worried that he would harm himself. He also advised that the man had left his pet bearded dragon with him. Officers responded, arriving on scene at about 9:03 p.m. The officers entered and spoke with the second caller regarding the man’s mental health issues. Officers were aware that the man had previously been apprehended under the Mental Health Act. The officers could hear banging and noise from the man’s apartment and noted numerous items littering the hallway and nearby stairwell, including a smashed air conditioning unit, broken ceramic items and pieces of wood. The man, who was in the apartment behind the closed door, could be heard yelling. One officer attempted to speak with the man and asked him to come into the hallway so that they could talk, but not to bring anything with him. The officer made this request approximately eight times. The man ultimately acknowledged the officers’ presence from inside the suite, when he said words to the effect of “So what, it’s the police.” The officer continued to encourage the man to come out to speak with him, saying he was concerned about his welfare. At one point, the officer thought that they persuaded the man to come out; however, shortly thereafter, he became more agitated and based on what the officers could hear, resumed smashing things in the apartment. Officers believed, based on the information received, that the man was alone in the suite but could not be sure. At 9:17 p.m., the decision was made to take a step back and cease trying to talk with the man in order to give him some time to calm down until EMS arrived on scene, at which point they would try to persuade the man to voluntarily go with EMS under the Mental Health Act. At about 9:21 p.m., an officer parked a marked police vehicle at the rear of the building, in front of a truck identified as belonging to the man. The other officers were either inside or in front of the building. The lone officer could see the man moving in the apartment but could not see specifically what he was doing. What sounded like something being broken and plastic ripping was heard just before the man came out onto his balcony holding what appeared to be a long silver knife in one hand and what was described as an axe in his other hand. The officer indicated that the man began randomly talking about weapons and killing “lots” of people. At about 9:28 p.m, the officer communicated this information to the other officers on scene. An officer who had been out in front of the building ran to the back of the building to assist, his service pistol drawn at the low ready. As he did so, the officer at the rear asked the man if he had a gun, prompting the man to respond with words to the effect of “No, I wish, I would shoot you all.” As confirmed by a nearby civilian witness, both officers encouraged the man to calm down. The man climbed onto the balcony railing and jumped off the balcony to the ground below, a distance of approximately 3.92 metres. The second officer told the man to drop the axe. The man responded, “No, I’m going to cut your fucking head off.” The man began very deliberately and quickly advancing on the second officer. In the words of the civilian witness, the man “rushed” the officer. As he did so, he repeated the words “Shoot me, shoot me” as the officer ordered him three or four times to drop the weapon/axe and to stop. The officer’s commands, which were described as clear and concise, were overhead not just by those at the rear of the residence but also by officers and paramedics staged at the front of the building. As the armed man continued closer, the officer fired a single shot that struck the man in the torso. The man twisted around, then fell to the ground. Both the civilian witness and the other officer placed the man as having closed the distance between himself and the second officer to within approximately 3-7 feet before the officer fired. The two officers secured the man and moved the axe out of his reach. Given the darkness and the snow, they did not immediately see the kitchen knives, which would later be recovered from the snow. The EMS personnel responded immediately to provide emergency treatment and transport to hospital. The man was conscious and complained that his wrists were sore, so the handcuffs were removed. EMS replaced these with soft Velcro restraints at the wrists and legs, as the man became increasingly agitated. Once at the hospital, he immediately underwent emergency surgery; however, he was declared deceased shortly after 2 a.m. on January 28, 2018. A small black-handled axe and one black-handled kitchen knife were recovered from the snow near where the man fell after being shot. A second black-handled knife was found in the snow under his balcony. Two additional knives, a folding knife and a throwing knife, were removed from the man’s clothing following the shooting.   Top row: Small axe and black-handled knives recovered from the snow. Bottom row: Throwing knife and folding knife recovered from man’s clothing following the shooting.   The man’s cause of death was determined to be a single gunshot wound to the torso. Toxicology confirmed the presence of alcohol and both the active THC component of cannabis and its metabolite in his body. Analysis It is always a tragedy when a life is lost during an encounter with police, even more so when the person dies in the midst of a mental health crisis. It is clear throughout the handling of this matter, however, that the officers were all working towards the safe apprehension of the man under the provisions of the Mental Health Act for assessment and treatment. Unfortunately, even when police act with the best of intentions, their response is determined by the situation. In this case, when the man armed himself and began threatening to kill people, the nature of the encounter changed. Under the Criminal Code, police officers are granted certain powers and authorities to facilitate the performance of what can be a challenging job. The Criminal Code authorizes a police officer to use as much force as is reasonably necessary in the administration or enforcement of the law. This can, in limited circumstances, include force that is intended or likely to cause grievous bodily harm or death. Resort to lethal force is only permitted where an officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm. Further, the Criminal Code provides that any person, including a police officer, may use reasonable force in self-defence or the defence of another person. In order for a police officer’s use of force to be authorized, the officer must be acting in the lawful execution of his or her duties. In this particular case, there is no question that all involved officers were acting in the lawful execution of their duties. They had the authority under the Mental Health Act and the Criminal Code to investigate, and apprehend or charge, particularly given the calls from residents who expressed fears for both the man and their own safety. Upon their arrival, the officers attempted to encourage the man to come speak with them, allowing themselves and the man time to resolve the situation peacefully, with or without the assistance of medical professionals. The strategic decision to step back and contain the man until medical assistance arrived on scene demonstrated their intention to calm things down. It was the man who ultimately escalated the situation to something clearly criminal and life-threatening. In the circumstances, viewing the incident as a whole, the officer’s use of lethal force, made only upon the man’s rapid advancement on the officer, while armed with an axe and a knife or knives, accompanied by threats to kill, was reasonable and justified. The risk presented by these actions was both serious and immediate. These actions, both objectively and subjectively, were capable of giving rise to a risk of grievous bodily harm or death to the officer, and accordingly, the officer’s decision to fire his service pistol was both lawful and justified. While the man was undoubtedly in the midst of a mental health crisis and potentially suicidal, he was not only capable of causing grievous bodily harm or death, he was threatening to do so. The officer provided clear commands to drop the weapons and/or stop and only fired when the man came close enough to present an imminent threat of grievous bodily harm or death. Conclusion There are no reasonable grounds, nor reasonable suspicion, to believe that the officer committed an offence(s) and as such, will not be charged with any offences. In the vast majority of cases involving a person in the midst of a mental health crisis, intervention, apprehension under the Mental Health Act, and a social-medical approach may be what is called for. It could be a critical mistake and naïve, however, to approach these cases assuming that a mentally ill person is necessarily harmless. Those in the midst of a mental health crisis can be as dangerous and capable of causing harm or killing as any other person, perhaps even more so, as they may not be rational and the opportunity for first responders to employ reason to negotiate a peaceful surrender can be compromised. The man’s behaviour on January 27, 2018 was that of a person clearly in the height of a mental health crisis. When he was well, prior to his injury in 2015, he was described as a hard worker, and a good son and brother whose family would never have imagined he could be involved in the events that unfolded that night. In this case, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the officers on scene were attempting to work toward a result that would enable the man to obtain the medical help he needed, but the nature of the situation changed dramatically when the man armed himself, made threats to kill, and jumped from the balcony and advanced on the officer. ASIRT’s mandate is to effectively, independently and objectively investigate incidents involving Alberta’s police that have resulted in serious injury or death to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of police misconduct.

Texas is Alberta’s second-largest export market in the United States, and it is vital we have an in-market presence to lead Alberta’s efforts to expand our commercial ties to the region. With his extensive government experience and his personal drive, Alberta needs someone like Dave who will engage with American business leaders and investors and put Alberta’s interests first. I have the utmost confidence he is the right person for this role.”  Jason Kenney, Premier    In his posting as agent general, Rodney will work to establish closer business relationships and pursue new investment opportunities that will revitalize Alberta’s energy sector and create jobs, since the province is a major supplier of energy resources to Texas and other states. Rodney is familiar with the diversity and challenges of the sector through his previous roles in government as the parliamentary secretary for Sustainable Resource Development and as Alberta’s energy representative to the Council of State Governments. He will also seek business opportunities to expand Alberta’s emerging sectors, including advanced technologies, health sciences, and aerospace and aviation.  “As economies gradually reopen, Alberta needs to be equipped and ready to rebuild its economic relationships with our trading partners. I am pleased that Dave Rodney has agreed to take on the role of agent general; we are beginning a new chapter in Alberta’s relationship with the United States and we need a person of his calibre to seek out new opportunities for Alberta’s businesses.” Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism  Reporting to the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism, the agent general will play a key role in delivering programming and services that support government priorities in international markets and work closely with the Canadian Consulate in Houston to promote Alberta’s interests in-market.  “I am humbled by the trust that Premier Kenney has placed in me, since he has asked me to assist as Alberta's agent general to Houston, U.S.A. It is an honour to serve the people of the province as we seek to advance the interests of Albertans in this invaluable market. Together, we will prove that investor confidence in numerous sectors is best placed in Alberta; with the resultant improvement of the livelihoods and quality of life of thousands of Albertans. I am ready to play my part in Premier Kenney's efforts to encourage and facilitate further bilateral trade and investment opportunities that will mutually benefit both Alberta and the United States, while seeking to build North American energy self-sufficiency."" Dave Rodney, Alberta Agent General to the U.S.   “Texas is Alberta’s second-largest partner and a key bilateral relationship. The value of our exports to the Lone Star state is $10.4 billion each year – a number that has been growing even through the last several challenging economic years. This relationship is clearly essential for the North American energy industry, however it has also become important for other strong sectors, including tech and innovation. Our province has a compelling case for greater investment through tax, talent, low cost of living, low cost of office space, and high quality of life. We are becoming hard to ignore. We’re very pleased to see that Alberta will be well-represented in bringing this message to Texas.” Adam Legge, president, Business Council of Alberta   “We are encouraged to see Alberta’s government strategically advancing our province’s interests and growing markets with our country’s largest trading partner. Growing our relationships and influence with our friends in Texas is something our province can look to in order to help grow our economy in the years to come, and today’s announcement will help facilitate that.” Terry O’Flynn, board chair, Alberta Enterprise Group   “Canada and the United States have a long history as trading partners, working toward economic growth and a high standard of living for the people of both countries. Alberta supplies significant energy exports to the United States and it is important – now more than ever – to maintain strong relationships and ensure continued market access for our exports.” Tim McMillan, president and CEO, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers   “Mr. Rodney has been a dedicated public servant and will be a strong representative for the Province of Alberta in this new role. International trade and the Texas market, in particular, are very important for Alberta, and Mr. Rodney’s experience will be of great assistance to Alberta’s exporters seeking to grow in the U.S. markets.” Joe Lougheed, chair, Calgary Economic Development   “PSAC supported Premier Kenney’s recent mission to Texas and is pleased that it is followed by the appointment of Dave Rodney as Alberta’s agent general to Houston. This is good news for PSAC members as the U.S. is an important source of investment capital for our sector and key export market for oilfield services. An in-market presence in Houston will also be an advantage for Albertan companies seeking opportunities in the U.S. for market intelligence, networking, and exposure.” Elizabeth Aquin, interim president and CEO, Petroleum Services Association of Canada  Rodney will start his three-year assignment immediately. When the Canada-U.S. border reopens and travel resumes, he will relocate to Houston. Until then, he will connect with American business leaders and investors through other means such as technology.  He will receive a bi-weekly salary of $9,635. Quick facts  During his mission to Houston in November 2019, Premier Kenney announced that Alberta would formally establish a presence in Houston. Texas is Alberta’s second-largest export market overall, and Alberta’s exports to Texas in 2018 totalled $11.6 billion worth of goods. Energy exports accounted for $8 billion. Alberta is one of the largest suppliers of imported oil and gas to the United States. In 2018, Alberta’s crude oil exports accounted for about 38 per cent of U.S. crude oil imports. Alberta is the largest supplier of natural gas to the U.S., providing about 70 per cent of the country’s imports in 2018. In 2018, Alberta and Texas signed a memorandum of understanding to seek opportunities to enhance trade and investment and to explore prospects for economic development that could contribute to job growth in Alberta and Texas across several sectors.

If passed, Bill 33 will create the Invest Alberta Corporation, an arm’s-length agency that will help promote Alberta as a prime investment location for businesses from across Canada and around the world, attracting high-value, job-creating investment.    “The Invest Alberta Corporation will lead an aggressive international campaign to attract job-creating investment across key sectors and tell institutional investors the truth about Alberta’s competitiveness and environmentally responsible energy sector. Alberta has seen the flight of tens of billions of dollars of capital in the last five years. In order to get Alberta back to work, we must reverse that flow of investment back to Alberta.” Jason Kenney, Premier  As an important part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Invest Alberta Corporation would play a central role in Alberta’s economic future. The agency would help instil investor confidence and generate investment in the province’s primary sectors – energy, agriculture and tourism. The corporation would also pursue investment opportunities for Alberta’s high-growth industries, such as technology, aviation and aerospace, and financial services.  “Investment attraction is essential to keep our economy moving. It stimulates sector growth, which in turn creates jobs across the province. The creation of the Invest Alberta Corporation will be pivotal as we plan ahead to restore economic certainty, especially now, when our businesses and Albertans need it most.” Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism  Alberta must be able to compete with other jurisdictions as global economies reopen. Some jurisdictions in Canada and around the world already have arm’s-length agencies in place to pursue investment opportunities and promote their jurisdictions’ interests. Once created, the new Alberta-based agency would highlight the low tax rates, highly skilled workforce and business-minded government policies that make Alberta a great place for investments. If the legislation passes, a public board would oversee the corporation’s operations and investment attraction activities. Government would provide $6 million annually for the next three years for its operations. Invest Alberta will coordinate the work of Alberta’s 11 trade promotion offices around the world, with a renewed focus on attracting foreign direct investment in Alberta. The corporation will also expand its footprint to include key foreign markets for Alberta, beginning with a presence in Houston, Texas. Alberta’s Recovery Plan builds on our strengths with timely, targeted investments and bold policy reforms that will:  Create tens of thousands of jobs right now. Make Alberta more competitive in the long term. Accelerate economic diversification in industries of the future. Ensure a strong future for the bedrock sector of our economy: Alberta’s innovative energy industry. Immediately show investors around the world that we mean business.  Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed, and return investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada.

If passed, this legislation could save job creators an estimated $100 million per year by reducing red tape from daily operations – helping them keep their doors open – and provide jobs for hard-working Albertans.  “Our government was elected on the promise of supporting employee choice and to bring balance back to Alberta’s labour laws. This bill will do just that and also help businesses save time and money, letting them focus on getting Albertans back to work while protecting workers.” Jason Copping, Minister of Labour and Immigration  Bill 32 will provide employees and employers with clearer and more transparent rules promoting fairness and productivity, including more clarity about rest periods and temporary layoff notices.  “As businesses reopen, we need to support our job creators. We told Albertans we would get them back to work and make it easier to do business in Alberta. That’s exactly what we’re doing by cutting this unneeded red tape.” Grant Hunter, Associate Minister of Red Tape Reduction   ""Alberta Construction Association applauds the Government of Alberta for introducing greater flexibility and reduced red tape in averaging agreements, hours of work, and temporary layoffs. Changes to these employment standards support seasonal, remote project-based construction jobs, while maintaining fairness in the workplace."" Frederick Vine, chairman, Alberta Construction Association   “Merit Contractors Association congratulates the Government of Alberta for returning balance to employers and their employees though revisions to the Labour Relations Code and Employment Standards Act. These positive changes send a message to investors and job creators that Alberta is open for business.” Malcolm Kirkland, president and chief executive officer, Merit Contractors Association   “The proposed changes in the provisions governing employees in the construction industry are a major step in the right direction for working Albertans. These changes represent good public policy that promotes fair and healthy competition among unions while enhancing worker choice and workplace democracy.” Dennis Perrin, provincial director, Christian Labour Association of Canada  To help inform these proposed changes, 5,421 responses were received during an online public survey conducted in November 2019. Restoring balance and economic stability  Clarifying that employees continue to accumulate vacation time while on a job-protected leave. Clarifying rules for rest periods and flexibility in scheduling breaks. Restoring balance to the relationship between employers and employees with updated rules for union certification and revocation, such as removing strict timelines and remedial certification provisions. Increasing employee choice by ensuring union members are not forced to fund political activities and causes without explicit opt-in approval. Balancing employee rights to fair collective bargaining, striking and picketing with the need to protect businesses and our economy from harm, and ensuring Albertans continue to receive services they rely on. Preventing unions from disciplining members if they take a significantly different job with a different employer. Updating rules for collective agreements will allow an existing collective agreement to remain in place if employees in the construction industry choose a new union before it expires. Changes to collective agreements and first contract arbitration will reduce red tape, encourage stability and help employers and employees work together to reach agreements. Increasing transparency and democracy in the workplace by making sure employees know how unions are spending their money. Changing rules for construction industry to ensure workforce stability and to attract major projects and investment.  Keeping businesses open and Albertans employed  Updating rules for temporary layoff notices to help employees stay attached to their jobs longer. Adding flexibility to rules for hours of work averaging arrangements to make it easier for employers to set up arrangements, create schedules, and calculate overtime. Helping youth find work, and reducing red tape and administrative burdens by expanding the types of jobs 13- and 14-year-olds are allowed to do without first needing a permit. Providing flexibility to the Labour Relations Board to expedite processes and efficiency during an emergency.  Saving employers time and money  Creating simpler and more flexible rules for general holiday pay, group terminations, payment of final earnings upon termination, payroll processes and paying administrative penalties to help employers save time and money in their daily operations. Making it easier for employers to apply for variances and exemptions. Allowing unions and employers to agree on standards that may work for them. Enabling the Labour Relations Board to serve employers, employees and unions more efficiently by reducing administrative burdens, costs and unnecessary hearings.

By amending the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act, the government is eliminating confusion about what constitutes a mineral by providing clear definitions in legislation. This will ensure sand continues to be regulated under its current process, which is simple, straightforward and protects the environment.  “Job creators should not need interpreters to understand legislation and regulatory laws. That’s why the government is taking action to ensure that sand and gravel operators have clear definitions that are accurate in legislation. Environment and Parks has had an effective and environmentally sound regulatory system in place for more than 15 years to review and approve projects. This bill will provide clarity and consistency for job creators in the sand and gravel industry while still maintaining stringent environmental protection regulations.” Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks  If passed, Bill 31 would amend the definition of minerals and pits in the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA), and remove references to silica sand in the Public Lands Act (PLA).  On May 6, the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled that sand is a mineral under the EPEA. This means that sand operations above 45,000 tonnes each year must be regulated as a quarry instead of a pit. Before this decision, all projects removing sand were regulated as pits. Legislative changes to two acts are needed to provide clarity and regulatory certainty for operators:  By amending the EPEA, we are removing confusion about what constitutes a mineral. This will ensure sand continues to be regulated under its current process, which is simple, straightforward and reflects its well understood environmental impacts. By amending the PLA to remove references to silica sand, we are creating certainty about the interpretation of sand by eliminating unclear and duplicative terminology. Since sand is already defined in provincial legislation, also defining silica sand makes application documents unnecessarily complicated for operators.  The court decision affects about 500 applications that are currently awaiting review. Applicants submitted the information required for a pit authorization – not a quarry approval – so the applications are now incomplete and cannot be authorized in their current state without the passing of Bill 31. Quick facts  Without government’s legislative amendments, any application for a sand project that is more than 45,000 tonnes annually now needs to be revised to include complex approval requirements and an environmental impact assessment (EIA). There are no consequences to the end of life/reclamation as a result of these proposed legislative amendments. Quarries and pits are both required to be reclaimed at the end of their life cycle.

The proposed amendments will ensure patients’ voices are included in the health-care system, help reduce surgical wait times and clarify roles and accountabilities of health system partners.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health  Highlights of Bill 30, the Health Statutes Amendment Act, include:  Supporting and strengthening the work of the Health Quality Council of Alberta so it can drive health system improvements and positive change for patients and families. Increasing the number of public members on Health Professional Regulatory College councils to ensure Albertans have a stronger voice and greater role in professional oversight. Streamlining the approval process for chartered surgical facilities to operate so they can provide more high-quality, publicly funded surgeries to help reduce surgical wait times without compromising patient safety or quality of care. Making it easier for physicians to enter into alternative relationship plans for compensation. Enabling government to contract with a range of organizations to operate medical clinics so physicians can focus on providing patient care, rather than administration. Clarifying the role of Alberta Health Services as the province’s single health authority, with Covenant Health as a strategic partner and the largest faith-based health-care provider. Ensuring the Hospital Privileges Appeals Board continues to have a strong, qualified group of members to review grievances brought forward by medical staff against hospital boards. Clarifying COVID-19 quarantine requirements under the Public Health Act to clearly articulate that all international travellers must quarantine for 14 days while the related chief medical officer of health orders are in effect.   “We value being officially recognized as Alberta’s one health authority, and will continue to work closely with our partners to provide quality health services across the province that meet the needs of patients and families.” Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO, Alberta Health Services   “CARNA believes the voice of patients and their families is critical when setting health-care policy and supports any government direction that legitimizes this voice.”  Dennie Hycha, president, College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta  Bill 30 would also repeal some legislation that no longer applies, since the bills were written when Alberta had multiple health regions.

A sandhill crane hunt launches on September 1 in more than 50 wildlife management units in southern and east-central Alberta.  “It’s great to see widespread support for a sandhill crane season in Alberta, which will support the province’s wildlife management goals and boost local economies. Alberta hunters care deeply about the province’s environment, species and wild places, and providing another opportunity to engage in a pursuit that supports conservation as well as economic activity is a win-win.” Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks   “The Alberta Fish and Game Association is pleased that Alberta hunters will have the opportunity to participate in the sustainable harvest of sandhill cranes starting this fall. The multi-jurisdictional population and harvest monitoring undertaken by Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the support of this season by Alberta Environment and Parks, under the leadership of Minister Nixon, has made this opportunity possible.” Brian Dingreville, President, The Alberta Fish and Game Association   “This announcement opens up a great opportunity for Albertans to participate in the sustainable harvest of a waterfowl species that has been hunted for many years across the rest of its range. Sandhill crane makes excellent table fare and I am certain Alberta’s waterfowl hunters will find that putting in the effort to harvest a Sandhill crane for a family meal is well worth it.” Todd Zimmerling, President & CEO, Alberta Conservation Association  The Alberta sandhill crane hunt will be similar to sandhill crane hunts in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with Alberta taking additional precautions by limiting sandhill crane hunting season to areas that are not known to overlap with the whooping crane migration or breeding range. The number of sandhill cranes in the province has increased steadily in recent years with exceptional survival rates for both young and adult birds. Alberta’s new sandhill crane hunt is supported by Alberta hunting stakeholders, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the Central Flyway Council. Quick facts  The new sandhill crane hunt will run concurrently with Alberta’s waterfowl season. Participating in the sandhill crane hunt requires a provincial game bird licence and a federal migratory bird licence. Sandhill cranes are hunted and eaten throughout their range. The Alberta hunt is expected to add only two per cent to the number of sandhill cranes harvested across North America. Sandhill crane hunting seasons have existed in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba for more than 50 years, with the sandhill crane population remaining healthy. In 2018 – the latest year for which we have numbers –fishing, hunting, trapping, and sport-shooting activities contributed $1.8 billion to Alberta’s GDP supporting 11,700 jobs, and generating $875 million in labour income.

Distribution of masks through these restaurant partners will resume on July 13. More details will be included with the official launch announcement. In June, 20 million masks were distributed through restaurant partners, municipalities, long-term care facilities, First Nations and Metis Settlements, and other organizations. Alberta is the only province in Canada to take this important step to help limit the spread of COVID-19 throughout the province.  “The first phase of free mask distribution in Alberta was a huge success and the response was an incredible show of community support. Thank you to all Albertans who are doing their part to keep each other safe as we move through stage two of relaunch.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health  Wearing a non-medical mask when it's difficult to maintain physical distancing of two metres is one way we can continue to limit the spread of COVID-19 as we relaunch our province. This initiative is a key part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely reopen our economy while protecting Albertans from COVID-19. In addition to the masks now being resupplied to restaurant partner locations, government is also providing more masks to:  Municipalities without easy access to a restaurant partner location First Nations and Metis Settlements Places of worship Transit services provincewide, including in Calgary and Edmonton  	 7-Eleven Canada is providing no-cost shipping of masks from the government’s warehouses to transit system operators across the province   Seniors organizations and independent living facilities Long-term care and supportive living facilities Women’s shelters, homeless shelters and street outreach programs Addiction treatment centres Other organizations that have highlighted a need for masks  Quick facts  Mask use is not mandatory; they are an option for situations where maintaining a distance of two metres is not possible. This program is intended to supplement an individual’s own efforts to acquire non-medical masks. Albertans who wish to use non-medical masks are encouraged to purchase their own supply from local retailers in addition to using those provided by government. Contact 211 for assistance if you cannot access a restaurant partner or access masks through alternate municipal or community providers. Alberta 211 is a community service partner supporting the distribution of masks. Any concerns or complaints about the distribution of masks should be directed to the feedback form on alberta.ca/masks.

La distribution de masques par ces restaurants partenaires reprendra le 13 juillet. Plus de détails seront inclus dans l'annonce officielle du lancement. En juin dernier, 20 millions de masques ont été distribués par l'intermédiaire des restaurants partenaires, des municipalités, des établissements de soins de longue durée, des Premières nations et des établissements métis, et d'autres organismes. L'Alberta est la seule province canadienne à avoir pris cette mesure importante pour limiter la propagation de la COVID-19 dans toute la province.  « La première phase de distribution gratuite de masques en Alberta a remporté un énorme succès et a permis à la population de démontrer l’appui communautaire incroyable qu’elle manifeste. Nous remercions tous les Albertains et toutes les Albertaines qui font leur part pour assurer la sécurité de tout un chacun alors que nous traversons la deuxième étape de la relance. » Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé  Le port d'un masque non médical lorsqu'il est difficile de maintenir une distance physique de deux mètres est une façon de continuer à limiter la propagation de la COVID-19 pendant la relance économique de notre province. Cette initiative est un élément clé de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta, qui vise à remettre notre économie sur les rails en toute sécurité, tout en protégeant la population albertaine contre la COVID-19. En plus des masques qui sont distribués de nouveau dans les restaurants partenaires, le gouvernement en fournira également aux entités suivantes :  les municipalités qui n'ont pas facilement accès à un restaurant partenaire les Premières nations et les établissements métis les lieux de culte les services de transport en commun de toute la province, y compris ceux de Calgary et d’Edmonton  	 les dépanneurs 7-Eleven Canada assurent l'expédition gratuite de masques depuis les entrepôts du gouvernement vers les exploitants de systèmes de transit de la province   les organismes de personnes âgées et les centres de vie autonome les centres de soins de longue durée et les centres de soutien les refuges pour femmes, les refuges pour sans-abri et les organismes de sensibilisation communautaire dans la rue les centres de traitement des toxicomanies d'autres organisations qui en ont fait la demande  En bref  L'utilisation du masque n'est pas obligatoire; il s’agit d’une solution pour les situations où il n'est pas possible de maintenir une distance de deux mètres des autres. Ce programme est destiné à soutenir les efforts des gens qui veulent acquérir des masques non médicaux. Les Albertains et les Albertaines qui souhaitent porter des masques non médicaux sont encouragés à s'approvisionner auprès de détaillants locaux en plus d’utiliser ceux qui sont fournis par le gouvernement.

Almost 12 years after TC Energy first proposed the project, thousands of local workers, including engineers, welders, heavy equipment operators, labourers, teamsters, safety inspectors, Indigenous monitors and other skilled tradespeople, are lacing up their work boots near Oyen and beginning construction on the Alberta spread of the 1,947-kilometre pipeline. Keystone XL will safely and reliably deliver up to 830,000 barrels per day of western Canadian crude oil from Hardisty to Steele City, Neb., where it will connect with existing facilities to reach U.S. Gulf Coast refiners to meet critical needs for transportation fuel and other life-enhancing products. Our province’s $1.5 billion equity stake in Keystone XL will enhance and protect the value of our natural resources, to the benefit of all Albertans.  “After many years of stringent environmental review, collaboration with landowners, local officials and Indigenous groups and a dogged determination to never say die, this project – essential to our economic recovery – is well underway. Not only will Keystone XL create jobs when they are needed most, it will strengthen continental energy security and independence by ensuring that Canadian oil – developed under the world’s highest environmental, human rights, and labour standards – continues to be a dominant force in global supply.” Jason Kenney, Premier  The project will see about 2,000 construction workers hired in Alberta over the next two years, spurring thousands of additional jobs and increased economic activity in associated trades, retail, and hospitality services along the construction route. Overall, the project will contribute about $2.4 billion to Canada’s GDP and will generate more than $7 million in property taxes in the first year in service. It’s estimated the project will generate $30 billion in tax and royalty revenues for current and future generations of Albertans.  “Keystone XL is an important energy infrastructure project that is poised to put thousands of people to work, generate substantial economic benefits and strengthen North American energy security. We greatly appreciate Premier Kenney’s partnership in this important investment and we look forward to working with his government as we continue to invest in and strengthen Alberta’s economy. We also strongly value the ongoing collaboration and support from First Nations, building trades unions, landowners, and our contractors and suppliers over the last dozen years.” Richard Prior, president, Keystone XL   “When post-pandemic energy demand revives, there will be a greater need than ever for Alberta to get our energy to market. We are immensely proud of our industry and will continue to stand alongside it and advocate for its resurgence. The Canadian oil sands will continue to be developed and continue to serve as a stable, reliable and responsible source of energy for Canada, the United States and the world.” Sonya Savage, Minister of Energy   “Keystone XL not only benefits the province’s economic wellbeing, it also benefits our municipality. By working together with the Province of Alberta, TC Energy, Michels and local officials, we will ensure the continued prosperity of our rural communities.” Roger Didychuk, senior vice-president, SITE Resource Group  Investing in Keystone XL is part of the more than $10 billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending, $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal, $150 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects, $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects, $500 million in municipal infrastructure and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL. Quick facts  269 kilometres of pipeline will be constructed and commissioned in Alberta over the next three years. Keystone XL is expected to be complete and operational in 2023. Safety is the project’s highest priority, and with the current and evolving COVID-19 conditions, construction crews will continue to take guidance from health authorities to determine the most proactive and responsible actions in order to ensure the workforce and the surrounding communities are safe during Keystone XL’s construction activities.

I share their concerns and I am not satisfied that this matter was handled appropriately. “Racism and bigotry have no place in our health-care system.

Consequently, I have issued a directive requiring AHS to revise their bylaws within 60 days. “Finally, I will be introducing legislation next week that will increase the number of public representatives on college councils, hearing tribunals and complaint review committees from 25 per cent to 50 per cent – which will increase the public’s oversight of health professions. “These initial steps are only the beginning.

The Government of Alberta supported COVID-19 response efforts by offering to match donations up to $2 million to eight designated Alberta-based registered charities made between April 15 and May 31. Albertans’ donations, combined with government’s matching dollars, raised about $7 million for the designated COVID-19 fundraising campaigns. Donations will help feed the hungry, care for seniors, support at-risk children, and keep Albertans employed.  “Albertans have come together to help others during a time when we are all struggling with different challenges due to COVID-19. As we begin the road to recovery, we thank Albertans for their overwhelming response and for kindly donating to help these fundraising campaigns so they can continue to meet the needs of vulnerable communities. Every donation matters, and we are hearing amazing stories about the great work our partner charities are doing to get dollars quickly to local charities delivering services to Albertans in need.”  Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women    “Thanks to the generosity of Albertans and the Government of Alberta’s matching program, millions of dollars have been raised to support people most at risk during COVID-19. We’ve been able to work with local partners, philanthropists, and a strong network of social agencies to quickly provide help with basic needs like food, shelter, mental health supports, technology, and personal protective equipment. This has made a huge difference in our communities at a time when many Albertans are struggling with unemployment, poverty, isolation, homelessness and other challenges. As the province moves from emergency response to recovery, we will continue to help vulnerable individuals, families, children and seniors. Thank you to Minister Aheer and the Government of Alberta for your tremendous support.” Karen Young, president and CEO, United Way of Calgary and Area  COVID-19 fundraising programs play an important role in ensuring donations flow through to local community-based non-profits and charitable organizations delivering services to vulnerable Albertans.

Le gouvernement de l’Alberta a appuyé les efforts de lutte contre la pandémie de COVID-19 en s’engageant à doubler les dons versés entre le 15 avril et le 31 mai à huit organismes de bienfaisance enregistrés en Alberta, dans la limite de 2 millions de dollars. Les dons ainsi collectés, associés aux dons jumelés du gouvernement, ont permis de recueillir environ 7 millions de dollars dans le cadre des campagnes partenaires de lutte contre la pandémie. Les dons permettront d’apporter une aide alimentaire, de prendre soin des personnes âgées, de soutenir les enfants à risque et de préserver les emplois.  « Les Albertains et les Albertaines se sont unis pour aider les autres à un moment où nous sommes tous aux prises avec différentes difficultés en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19. Maintenant que nous sommes sur la voie du rétablissement, nous remercions la population pour sa réaction extraordinaire et pour ses dons généreux en faveur des collectes de fonds qui permettront de poursuivre les actions au profit des communautés vulnérables. Chaque don compte, et nous recevons des récits étonnants sur les efforts que font nos organismes de bienfaisance partenaires pour reverser rapidement cet argent aux organismes caritatifs locaux qui fournissent des services aux personnes dans le besoin. » Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine   « Grâce à la générosité des Albertains et des Albertaines et au programme de dons jumelés du gouvernement de l’Alberta, des millions de dollars ont été recueillis pour soutenir les personnes les plus à risque pendant la pandémie. Nous avons pu travailler avec des partenaires locaux, des philanthropes et un solide réseau d’agences sociales afin d’apporter rapidement de l’aide pour les besoins de base, comme la nourriture, le logement, le soutien en santé mentale, la technologie et l’équipement de protection individuelle. Cela a eu un énorme impact dans nos collectivités à un moment où de nombreuses personnes sont aux prises avec le chômage, la pauvreté, l’isolement, l’itinérance et d’autres difficultés.

The twinning project will support about 755 jobs and will drive economic recovery and diversification in southern Alberta. Twinning Highway 3 will improve safety along this increasingly busy portion of the highway.  “This project is part of our government’s $10-billion economic recovery program. We need to build, diversify and create jobs following the largest financial hit in Alberta’s history. These projects lay the foundation for the private sector to create thousands of well-paying jobs for workers while creating many spinoff benefits for Alberta — including making communities more attractive to businesses looking to relocate. A strong highway network is vital to create jobs, spur economic growth and get Alberta back on track to economic recovery and growth.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “The agri-business sector is a key part of Alberta’s economic recovery. That’s why we are investing in critical infrastructure that creates jobs now and ensures that we can support the growth of this important sector. Twinning Highway 3 makes the roads safer, more efficient, and gets Albertans working when jobs are needed most.” Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation   “The twinning of Highway 3, between Taber and Burdett, will not only increase safety in the movement of goods, services and people but it will also be a major infrastructure tool in helping establish this busy corridor as the agri-food hub of Canada.” Grant Hunter, MLA for Taber-Warner  Highway 3 is a vital east-west link, and is the major connector between Saskatchewan and British Columbia, south of the Trans-Canada Highway. Designed to improve long-term productivity, the Highway 3 twinning project is part of the more than $10-billion infrastructure spending announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan. This spending includes: $6.9 billion Budget 2020 capital spending; $980 million accelerated for Capital Maintenance and Renewal; $150 million for Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program and water infrastructure projects; $600 million in strategic infrastructure projects; $500 million in municipal infrastructure; and $1.5 billion for Keystone XL. Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefit Albertans and communities. It will further diversify our economy by helping sectors grow and succeed and return investment to our province by ensuring we have the most competitive tax environment in Canada. Quick facts  Construction will begin in 2021. The project will take about three years to complete. In addition to twinning, there will be key intersection improvements, in particular at Highway 877 at Grassy Lake. This stretch of Highway 3 sees about 3,900 vehicles per day.

Alberta relies on the free flow of trade and investment for job creation across all sectors of the economy. This agreement will serve as the foundation of our economic relationship with our North American partners – including our largest trading partner the United States – for years to come. This is an important milestone for Alberta, and for Canada. “CUSMA provides clarity, economic stability and facilitates job creation with an agreed set of rules that govern cross-border trade and investment with our trading partners in Mexico and the United States. The CUSMA is a modern and forward-looking agreement, covering new areas such as digital trade, and encouraging new entrants to trade, such as micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, making it easier to attract investment into these areas. “For Alberta businesses, this means we can broaden our commercial ties with certainty and forge bonds with job creators across the continent. We have the opportunity to accelerate the flow of Alberta’s goods and expand our exports throughout North America. “As we begin to reopen our economy, the timing of the CUSMA is significant, especially for our province’s energy sector. Because Alberta’s energy industry is highly integrated throughout North America, this is a signal to investors they can look to our province with increased confidence as an attractive investment destination.  “Moving forward, our government will continue its efforts to strengthen our relationships throughout the world to grow our economy, encourage trade and investment, and pursue innovation and commercialization of new technology that will help create jobs across the province.”  Media inquiries                                               Justin Brattinga                                           780-203-0177 Press Secretary, Economic Development, Trade and Tourism    "

By fully implementing the Job Creation Tax Cut a year and a half ahead of schedule, government is sending a strong message that we are open for business. Alberta’s general corporate income tax rate is now at least 30 per cent lower than any other provincial rate. Accelerating the tax cut provides Alberta businesses with confidence and certainty as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, freeing up resources to hire Albertans. It also makes Alberta an attractive location for companies outside the province to relocate and take advantage of the province’s competitive tax rate.  “As Alberta moves towards recovery, we remain committed to making our province one of the most tax-competitive jurisdictions in North America and the top business destination in the country. The Job Creation Tax Cut will dovetail with the new Innovation Employment Grant to support a wide range of Alberta job creators.” Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance  Corporate tax cut and new incentive promote economic diversification The Innovation Employment Grant, recently announced as part of Alberta’s Recovery Plan, will complement the Job Creation Tax Cut by targeting small and medium-sized companies in the early stages of operation. Combined, these programs will reward innovation, diversification and investment by businesses of all sizes in all sectors of the economy. Both measures support the development of new products and ideas, but a low general corporate tax rate also provides a strong incentive to commercialize those products here in Alberta, instead of other jurisdictions. A low general corporate tax rate also encourages diversification, as it provides more benefit to companies outside the resource sector and adds extra incentive to invest and grow in Alberta. This includes both smaller and larger firms, as government estimates that 75 per cent of the businesses benefiting from the Job Creation Tax Cut file taxes as small businesses.    More information about the Innovation Employment Grant will be available soon. Alberta’s government is helping create thousands of good jobs for Albertans by building schools, roads and other core infrastructure that benefits Albertans and communities.

Happy Canada Day! 153 years ago today our great Northern Dominion began, binding together the colonies and territories of British North America. Their unity was built on a shared belief in ordered liberty, safeguarded by the institutions of Parliamentary government within a constitutional Monarchy.  With Confederation, our founders also launched a bold experiment that sought unity in diversity, bringing together in one political community different cultures, languages and faiths. The country that they united developed through the sacrifices of waves of newcomers, each drawn to Canada as a land of freedom and opportunity, a freedom that Canadians defended at great cost on foreign battlefields.  On this Dominion Day, let us be grateful for their sacrifices, and for the vision of our founders, foremost amongst them Sir John A Macdonald.  As Albertans, let us celebrate the enormous contribution that we have made as champions of enterprise, helping to make Canada one of the most prosperous nations on Earth.  It is no accident that our province’s motto “fortis et liber,” comes from the national anthem’s call for a “true North strong and free.” Let us also resolve to continue building a Canada that is freer, fairer, and more just.  We must keep continue on the path of reconciliation with Indigenous people whose ancestors first inhabited this land, ensuring that equality of opportunity is a reality for them, and for Canadians of all backgrounds. And we must repair inequities within the federation, so that all provinces are unleashed to flourish and prosper. Today should be one of gratitude and celebration as we strive to fulfill the vision of the martyr of Confederation, Thomas D’Arcy McGee: “I see in the not remote distance, one great nationality bound, like the shield of Achilles, by the blue rim of ocean – I see it quartered into many communities – each disposing of its internal affairs – but all bound together by free institutions, free intercourse, and free commerce; I see within the round of that shield, the peaks of the Western mountains and the crests of the Eastern waves…, I see a generation of industrious, contented, moral men, free in name and in fact – men capable of maintaining, in peace and in war, a Constitution worthy of such a country.” *Editor's note: statement has been updated from a previous version.

The investment in the agri-food hub, which is part of the centre’s larger redevelopment project, will serve as an anchor for growth of Alberta’s value-added food sector. The project aligns with the work of the regional partners in Canada's Premier Food Corridor to attract private investment and includes collaboration with Lethbridge College, capitalizing on their applied research success in the agri-food sector and providing applied learning opportunities for culinary students. The project will generate 400 construction jobs and an estimated 50 incremental jobs after completion. Its estimated ongoing economic impact will grow to $90 million annually, an economic boost to Lethbridge and southern Alberta.  “Alberta’s agriculture and agri-food sector is a cornerstone of our economic recovery plan. This investment will help get Albertans back to work now and will fuel the long-term growth of Alberta’s dynamic agriculture industry.” Jason Kenney, Premier  The expansion will also more than double Exhibition Park’s capacity, attracting more and larger national and international events. As well, there will be enhanced incubation opportunities for local producers to build their business and sell their products nationally and internationally. Increasing the space available for food production by more than 10 times the current amount means more possibilities for the students in Lethbridge College’s Culinary Arts Program. This expansion will help Exhibition Park offer the finest and largest-scale farm-to-table culinary experience in the industry. Exhibition Park is currently working with area partners to make this a reality.  “Agriculture contributes so much to Alberta’s economy and this investment at Exhibition Park to develop an agri-food hub will continue to strengthen our agriculture sector.” Devin Dreeshen, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry   “It’s hard to overstate how important Exhibition Park is to Lethbridge, socially and economically. This investment will help it serve even more of Lethbridge and southern Alberta and I look forward to attending events in the new space.” Nathan Neudorf, MLA for Lethbridge-East   “The City of Lethbridge welcomes this investment in the Exhibition Park agri-food hub. We see this project as an economic catalyst that will lead to greater investment and job creation as agricultural industries further develop in the city and the region. We are proud to be recognized as part of Canada’s premier food corridor and look forward to strengthening that position with this project.” Chris Spearman, mayor, City of Lethbridge   “This commitment to the community, industry and region establishes immediate and long-term job creation, creates external investment opportunity and further showcases southern Alberta as a world-leading agricultural production and processing region.” Mike Warkentin, chief operating officer, Lethbridge and District Exhibition  Quick facts  The expansion project is targeting the following:  	 A 22 per cent increase in event capacity A food production capacity increase of more than 10 times the current amount   Exhibition Park, also known as the Lethbridge and District Exhibition, is Alberta’s fourth-oldest agricultural society.

Before this regulation amendment, only physicians could complete driver medical examination forms in Alberta. Driver medical examinations are required at specified intervals for drivers age 75 or older, commercial drivers, and those with certain medical conditions.  “Nurse practitioners are already able to complete the tasks to assess a driver’s medical fitness, but they are not legally allowed to conduct a driver medical exam and fill out the driver medical form in Alberta. This change is long overdue and will reduce red tape while increasing Albertans’ access to services without affecting safety on our roads.” Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation   “Our government is creating another way for Albertans to benefit from the skills of nurse practitioners as part of our broader strategy to allow all health-care professionals to work to their full competence and give Albertans more choice and better access to services.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health   “Nurse practitioners have advanced qualifications that enable them to provide independent primary care in Alberta. This is a welcome change and will give nurse practitioners more opportunities to work to their full scope of practice. We will continue to work with government to support nurse practitioners’ expanded role in our health system.” Mary-Elizabeth Cooper, president, Nurse Practitioner Association of Alberta   “CARNA is pleased Albertans will now benefit from the skills and professionalism of nurse practitioners with this amendment. Keeping Albertans safe on our roads is critical and nurse practitioners are an ideal health-care profession to help safeguard the licensing process.” Dennie Hycha, council president, College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta  The government will engage with other health-care professional regulatory colleges to determine if other health-care providers are also qualified to conduct driver medical examinations.  Quick facts  The amendment to the Operator Licensing and Vehicle Control Regulation authorizes nurse practitioners to complete driver medical examinations. About 150,000 driver’s medical examination forms are filed with Alberta Transportation each year. Most are for individuals applying for a commercial driver’s licence.

William Watson Lodge provides year-round, barrier-free wilderness lodging for persons with disabilities, seniors and their families. Beginning in late July, the existing main day lodge will be demolished and a new day lodge will be built. The Government of Alberta is investing $6 million into the project, which will take about two years to complete and create well-paying construction jobs for Alberta workers.  “William Watson Lodge has served Albertans with accessibility challenges for almost 40 years and we want this tradition to continue. The new day lodge will vastly improve safety for visitors, caregivers and staff, and construction will create jobs for Albertans. I look forward to seeing the new facility when it is fully operational and ready to welcome visitors again.” Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks  The day lodge is at the end of its lifespan and requires replacement in order to continue to be able to serve Albertans living with disabilities and Alberta seniors. Design plans will improve its environment footprint by using low-impact building materials and reducing the facility’s energy consumption while complying with international accessibilty standards. To ensure a safe construction site, the area will be fully closed to visitors for the duration of the rebuild.   Built in 1981, William Watson Lodge has connected people of all abilities, ages and cultures to recreational opportunities in nature. Until construction is underway, the lodge and campground will accept bookings for visitors from July 2-26. To make a reservation, please call 403-591-7227.

The increase applies to attendees at community outdoor events such as festivals, fireworks displays, rodeos and sporting events, and outdoor performances. All public health measures, including physical distancing, remain in place. Seated outdoor events will still require the necessary space between families and cohorts within stadium-style seating. Any large gathering increases the risk of transmission. Evidence suggests that outdoor events have a lower risk of transmission, provided other public health guidance is followed. Alberta Health will continue to monitor case numbers and adjust as necessary. For more information on outdoor and indoor gathering restrictions, visit alberta.ca/restrictions-on-gatherings. General relaunch guidance, including sector-specific recommendations, can be found at alberta.ca/guidance-documents.  La limite des rassemblements en plein air est passée de 100 à 200 personnes. Cette augmentation s'applique aux participants d’événements communautaires en plein air tels que les festivals, les feux d'artifice, les rodéos et les événements sportifs, ainsi qu'aux spectacles à l’extérieur. Toutes les mesures de santé publique, y compris l'éloignement physique, restent en place. Pour les événements extérieurs où les participants sont assis, la distance nécessaire entre les familles et les cohortes devra être respectée dans les gradins. Tout grand rassemblement augmente le risque de transmission. Les études montrent que les événements en plein air présentent un risque de transmission plus faible, à condition que les autres recommandations de santé publique soient suivies.

Following the initial economic devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented crash in oil prices, the Government of Alberta is stepping forward with a plan to address both the short-term and long-term challenges facing our province. It is a plan to create jobs now that will set Alberta on a path for economic growth, diversification and renewal for the future.  “Albertans have risen to the challenge of the pandemic, though we will continue to be careful, especially for those who are most at risk. Now we must extend that same culture of resilience to overcoming the greatest economic challenge of our time. Today, we take a big step forward in that journey with the launch of Alberta’s Recovery Plan, a bold, ambitious long-term strategy to build our province, to diversify our economy, and to create jobs.” Jason Kenney, Premier  Alberta’s Recovery Plan includes the many government relief programs that we have put in place to support Albertans and Alberta job creators through the COVID-19 pandemic. It also builds on strategic investments already underway, including the Keystone XL pipeline and $1 billion in accelerated Capital Maintenance and Renewal funding, which are putting thousands of Albertans to work this summer. The plan will continue under three main pillars: creating jobs, building infrastrtucture that will spur ecnomic growth, and continuing to diversify our economy. Building: Investing in Infrastructure This year Alberta will see the largest ever investment in the province’s infrastructure, with $10 billion being spent on projects in every corner of the province, creating 50,000 jobs. Government is taking unprecedented actions to create immediate jobs in ways that build communities for a bigger, brighter future and support long-term private sector job creation. Workers will be getting back on the job of building facilities, repairing roads and preparing Alberta to be stronger than ever. Strategic projects In a major new initiative, the government will launch a series of large-scale infrastructure projects this summer at a total cost of $612 million. These projects are designed to create at least 2,500 jobs and the projects have been chosen to improve long-term economic growth and to encourage investment across the province. These strategic projects will be spread across every region of the province, and will include the twinning of highways, projects that support growth in the agricultural sector, gas line extensions for northern residents, treatment facilities for Albertans recovering from addictions, and other important projects. The projects announced today will be followed by more projects announced in the coming months that will drive economic expansion and provide a legacy that will benefit our province for decades to come. Creating jobs Strong economic fundamentals are reinforced in Alberta’s Recovery Plan with the immediate acceleration of the Job Creation Tax Cut. On July 1, the corporate income tax rate will drop to eight per cent – a year and a half sooner than promised. Government is also doubling down on its commitment to reduce red tape by ensuring government processes and regulations in the province do not constrain growth.  “The Job Creation Tax Cut is essential to Alberta’s recovery, ensuring our province has a competitive tax regime for job creators. When Alberta’s corporate income tax rate hits eight per cent, British Columbia’s corporate income tax will be 50 per cent higher at 12 per cent. As employers work to recover from COVID-19 they can be confident that Alberta will be the best place in Canada – by far – to locate, bringing with them jobs and prosperity.” Travis Toews, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance  Innovation Employment Grant We are also introducing an Innovation Employment Grant targeted to smaller companies and encouraging technology and investment in Alberta. It will provide a refundable tax credit to companies that invest in research and development, leaving them more money to employ Albertans in areas of innovation. With the Innovation Employment Grant, Alberta-based companies will have a competitive advantage at every stage in their development. During pre-income and scale-up phases, companies will benefit from this program, and as they become profitable and no longer qualify for the grant, they will benefit from the Job Creation Tax Cut. Putting Albertans first We will put Albertans, including recently arrived new Canadians, first for available jobs by asking the federal government to remove most occupational categories under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program for Alberta. At the same time, we will help employers connect with unemployed Albertans, making job training programs more responsive, and accelerating the Fairness for Newcomers Action Plan to put new Albertans who are already here to work faster in jobs that reward their skills and training.   Due to the impairment of international travel, and the deep jobs crisis, government will also reduce by at least one-third this year’s targeted admissions under the Alberta Immigration Nominee Program, while moving ahead with key platform commitments like the Foreign Graduate Startup Visa Program to support growth in the tech and innovation sectors. This reflects evidence that newcomers who arrive during economic recessions do less well economically in the short term and for the rest of their careers. When economic conditions improve and employment rises, we will return to previous levels. Supporting arts and culture We will create a Cultural Event Relaunch Program to support music, performing arts and landmark events which have been especially hard-hit by public health measures. This program will help those events which may relaunch in the summer address physical distancing requirements, or relaunch as strong as ever in the next season. The government has also committed to growing Alberta’s cultural industries by 25 per cent to $1.5 billion in the next decade. Municipal infrastructure Funding for strategic projects is supplemented by increased funding for municipal programs. In addition to the $50 million announced for municipalities through the Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program (STIP) to fund bridge improvements, upgrades to roads and community airports and other initiatives and a further $150 million for water infrastructure grants through the Alberta Municipal Water/Wastewater Partnership, we have identified up to $500 million in further funding for municipalities, funding we expect will be matched by Ottawa. Even before the federal contribution, this represents an increase to municipal infrastructure funding of almost 30 per cent in the current fiscal year. It is estimated this new $500 million will support the creation of at least 2,500 jobs – immediate new jobs for projects that support people in the communities where they live, and drive future economic growth in the province. Diversifying the economy Sector strategies Alberta’s Recovery Plan will focus on sector strategies for diversifying the economy. Building on our advantages in energy, agriculture, technology and tourism, these strategies will serve to support growth in other high-opportunity sectors such as value-added petrochemical manufacturing, minerals, including rare earth minerals, pharmaceuticals, the financial sector, logistics and aviation. The details of these sector strategies will be announced this summer and fall. Technology Government is also announcing its commitment to diversification through a re-capitalization of the Alberta Enterprise Corporation (AEC). Government is investing $175 million over the next three years in capital funds that support the technology sector in Alberta. Promoting Alberta Government is establishing a new investment agency to help restore economic growth, create jobs, and diversify our economy. The Invest Alberta corporation will boost investment attraction efforts in key markets with major partners around the globe. It will increase investment in Alberta’s primary industries – energy, agriculture, and tourism and encourage investment in our high-potential sectors, such as technology, aviation and aerospace, and financial services. Government has allocated $6 million annually for the next three years for its operations. This funding is part of the $75 million allocated to implement the Investment and Growth Strategy over the next three years to rebuild Alberta’s reputation as a destination for business and investment.  “Altogether, this plan represents a bold statement of confidence in the future of Alberta. It is based on common sense, not ideology. It balances targeted government spending in areas like job-creating infrastructure with strong incentives for private sector growth, like the accelerated Job Creation Tax Cut and the expanded Red Tape Reduction initiative. It ensures a future for our largest industry – oil and gas – while boosting diversification in key growth sectors, like tech and innovation through the new Innovation Employment Grant, and the Alberta Enterprise Corporation.” Jason Kenney, Premier    Related information  Alberta’s Recovery Plan Support for Alberta’s Recovery Plan (PDF) Economic Statement (PDF) Economic Recovery Council Blueprint for Jobs COVID-19 info for Albertans    Multimedia  View the event photo Listen to the news conference Watch the news conference     Le plan de relance de l’Alberta présente la stratégie économique détaillée de la province, notamment un investissement record de 10 milliards de dollars dans l’infrastructure et un plan visant la création de 50 000 emplois cette année. À la suite de la dévastation économique initiale causée par la pandémie de COVID-19 et de l’effondrement sans précédent des prix du pétrole, le gouvernement de l’Alberta présente un plan pour relever les défis à court et à long terme auxquels la province est confrontée. Il s’agit d’un plan visant à créer des emplois maintenant afin que l’Alberta assure des perspectives de croissance, de diversification et de renouveau économiques pour l’avenir.  « Les Albertains et les Albertaines ont relevé le défi de la pandémie, mais nous continuerons d’être prudents, surtout en ce qui concerne les citoyens qui sont les plus à risque. Nous devons maintenant faire preuve de la même résilience pour surmonter le plus grand défi économique de notre époque. Aujourd’hui, nous franchissons une étape importante de la reprise avec le lancement du plan de relance de l’Alberta, une stratégie audacieuse et ambitieuse à long terme visant à bâtir l’infrastructure de la province, diversifier notre économie et créer des emplois. » Jason Kenney, premier ministre  Le plan de relance de l’Alberta comprend les nombreux programmes d’aide gouvernementaux que nous avons mis en place pour soutenir la population albertaine et les créateurs d’emplois de l’Alberta pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Ce plan s’appuie également sur des investissements stratégiques déjà en cours, notamment le pipeline Keystone XL et un financement accéléré de 1 milliard de dollars pour l’entretien et le renouvellement des immobilisations, permettant à des milliers d’Albertains et d’Albertaines de travailler cet été. Le plan se poursuivra avec trois piliers principaux : la création d’emplois, la construction d’infrastructures pour stimuler la croissance économique et la poursuite de la diversification de notre économie. Bâtir : Investir dans l’infrastructure Cette année, l’Alberta verra le plus important investissement jamais réalisé dans l’infrastructure de la province, avec 10 milliards de dollars investis dans des projets à l’échelle de la province, grâce à la création de 50 000 emplois. Le gouvernement prend des mesures sans précédent pour créer immédiatement des emplois assurant un meilleur avenir pour les collectivités et soutenir la création d’emplois à long terme dans le secteur privé. Les travailleurs reprendront la construction d’installations, la réparation des routes et ils contribueront à faire de l’Alberta une province plus forte que jamais. Projets stratégiques Dans le cadre d’une nouvelle initiative majeure, le gouvernement lancera cet été une série de projets d’infrastructure à grande échelle pour un coût total de 612 millions de dollars. Ces projets sont destinés à créer au moins 2 500 emplois et les projets ont été choisis pour améliorer la croissance économique à long terme et encourager les investissements dans toute la province. Ces projets stratégiques seront répartis dans toutes les régions de la province et comprendront l’élargissement à quatre voies d’autoroutes, des projets qui appuient la croissance dans le secteur agricole, des prolongements de conduites de gaz pour les résidents du Nord, des centres de traitement pour les Albertains et les Albertaines qui se remettent d’une toxicomanie et d’autres projets importants. Les projets annoncés aujourd’hui seront suivis par d’autres qui seront annoncés au cours des prochains mois, qui stimuleront l’expansion économique et assureront des retombées durables qui profiteront à notre province pendant des dizaines d’années. Créer des emplois Des bases économiques solides sont renforcées dans le plan de relance de l’Alberta avec l’accélération immédiate de la baisse d’impôt pour la création d’emplois. Le 1er juillet, le taux d’imposition des sociétés sera réduit pour s’établir à 8 %; un an et demi plus tôt que prévu. Le gouvernement renforce également son engagement à réduire les formalités administratives en veillant à ce que les processus et les règlements gouvernementaux de la province ne freinent pas la croissance.  « La réduction d’impôt pour la création d’emplois est essentielle à la reprise de l’Alberta, car elle garantit à notre province un régime fiscal concurrentiel pour les créateurs d’emplois. Lorsque le taux de l’impôt sur le revenu des sociétés de l’Alberta atteindra 8 %, l’impôt sur le revenu des sociétés de la Colombie-Britannique sera de 12 %, ce qui est 50 % plus élevé. Alors que les employeurs s’efforcent de se redresser par suite de la COVID-19, ils peuvent être certains que l’Alberta sera de loin le meilleur endroit au Canada pour s’installer, leur offrant emplois et prospérité. » Travis Toews, président du Conseil du Trésor de l’Alberta et ministre des Finances  Subvention à l’emploi pour l’innovation Nous introduisons également une subvention à l’emploi pour l’innovation destinée aux petites entreprises et nous encourageons les technologies et l’investissement en Alberta. Cette subvention sera un crédit d’impôt remboursable accordé aux entreprises qui investissent dans la recherche et le développement, leur laissant plus d’argent pour embaucher des Albertains et des Albertaines dans les domaines de l’innovation. Grâce à la subvention à l’emploi pour l’innovation, les entreprises établies en Alberta bénéficieront d’un avantage concurrentiel à chaque étape de leur croissance. Pendant les phases d’avant revenu et d’expansion, les entreprises bénéficieront de ce programme et, à mesure qu’elles deviendront rentables et ne pourront plus bénéficier de la subvention, elles bénéficieront de la réduction d’impôt pour la création d’emplois. Priorité aux Albertains et Albertaines Nous placerons les Albertains et les Albertaines, y compris les nouveaux arrivants au Canada, au premier rang des emplois offerts en demandant au gouvernement fédéral de supprimer la plupart des catégories professionnelles du Programme des travailleurs étrangers temporaires pour l’Alberta. De même, nous aiderons les employeurs à établir des liens avec les Albertains et les Albertaines au chômage, en faisant en sorte que les programmes de formation professionnelle soient plus adaptés et en accélérant le plan d’action pour l’équité envers les nouveaux arrivants pour que les nouveaux Albertains et les nouvelles Albertaines qui sont déjà dans la province puissent travailler plus rapidement dans des emplois qui récompensent leurs compétences et leur formation. En raison de la diminution des voyages internationaux et de la crise profonde en matière d’emploi, le gouvernement réduira également d’au moins un tiers les admissions ciblées cette année dans le cadre du programme des candidats à l’immigration de l’Alberta. Des engagements clés de la plateforme, comme le programme de visa pour les jeunes diplômés étrangers, seront toutefois respectés afin de soutenir la croissance dans les secteurs de la technologie et de l’innovation. Nous devons tenir compte du fait que les nouveaux arrivants qui arrivent en période de récession économique s’en sortent moins bien sur le plan économique à court terme et tout au long du reste de leur carrière. Lorsque les conditions économiques s’amélioreront et que l’emploi repartira à la hausse, nous reviendrons aux niveaux précédents. Soutenir les arts et la culture Nous allons créer un programme de relance des événements culturels pour soutenir la musique, les arts du spectacle et les événements marquants qui ont été particulièrement touchés par les mesures de santé publique. Ce programme aidera les organisateurs d’événements susceptibles d’être relancés pendant l’été à répondre aux exigences d’éloignement physique ou à reprendre comme avant la crise lors de la prochaine saison. Le gouvernement s’est également engagé à faire croître les industries culturelles de l’Alberta de 25 %, visant des retombées de 1,5 milliard de dollars au cours des 10 prochaines années. Infrastructure municipale Le financement des projets stratégiques est complété par une augmentation du financement des programmes municipaux. En plus des 50 millions de dollars annoncés pour les municipalités dans le cadre du Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program (programme des infrastructures stratégiques de transport) pour financer l’amélioration des ponts, la modernisation des routes et des aéroports communautaires et d’autres initiatives, ainsi que des 150 millions de dollars supplémentaires de subventions à l’appui des infrastructures d’eau dans le cadre du partenariat Alberta Municipal Water/Wastewater Partnership (partenariat relatif aux réseaux municipaux d’eau potable et d’eaux usées), nous avons cerné jusqu’à 500 millions de dollars de financement supplémentaire pour les municipalités, financement qui devrait être jumelé par Ottawa. Même avant la contribution fédérale, cela représente une augmentation de près de 30 % du financement des infrastructures municipales au cours de l’exercice courant. On estime que ce nouveau montant de 500 millions de dollars permettra d’appuyer la création d’au moins 2 500 emplois; de nouveaux emplois immédiats pour des projets qui soutiennent les personnes dans leurs collectivités, et qui sont le moteur de la croissance économique future de la province. Diversifier l’économie Stratégies sectorielles Le plan de relance de l’Alberta mettra l’accent sur les stratégies sectorielles de diversification de l’économie. S’appuyant sur nos atouts en matière d’énergie, d’agriculture, de technologie et de tourisme, ces stratégies serviront à soutenir la croissance dans d’autres secteurs à fort potentiel tels que la fabrication de produits pétrochimiques à valeur ajoutée, les minéraux, notamment les minéraux de terres rares, les produits pharmaceutiques, le secteur financier, la logistique et l’aviation. Les détails de ces stratégies sectorielles seront annoncés cet été et cet automne. Technologie Le gouvernement annonce également son engagement en faveur de la diversification au moyen d’une recapitalisation d’Alberta Enterprise Corporation. Le gouvernement investira 175 millions de dollars au cours des trois prochaines années dans des fonds d’immobilisations qui soutiennent le secteur technologique en Alberta. Promouvoir l’Alberta Le gouvernement est en train de créer une nouvelle agence d’investissement pour aider à relancer la croissance économique, à créer des emplois et à diversifier notre économie. La société Invest Alberta intensifiera les efforts déployés pour attirer des investissements sur les marchés clés avec des partenaires majeurs du monde entier. Elle augmentera les investissements dans les industries primaires de l’Alberta (l’énergie, l’agriculture et le tourisme) et encouragera les investissements dans nos secteurs à fort potentiel, comme la technologie, l’aviation et l’aérospatiale et les services financiers. Le gouvernement a attribué 6 millions de dollars annuellement pour les trois prochaines années pour ses activités. Ce financement fait partie des 75 millions de dollars attribués à la mise en œuvre de la stratégie d’investissement et de croissance au cours des trois prochaines années pour rebâtir la réputation de l’Alberta en tant que destination d’affaires et d’investissement.  « Dans l’ensemble, ce plan représente une audacieuse déclaration de confiance dans l’avenir de l’Alberta. Il est fondé sur le bon sens et non sur une idéologie. Il établit un équilibre entre les dépenses publiques ciblées dans des domaines tels que les infrastructures créatrices d’emplois et les fortes incitations à la croissance du secteur privé, comme la réduction accélérée de l’impôt pour la création d’emplois et l’initiative élargie de réduction des formalités administratives. Il assure un avenir à notre plus grande industrie, les hydrocarbures, tout en stimulant la diversification dans des secteurs de croissance clés, comme la technologie et l’innovation grâce à la nouvelle subvention à l’emploi pour l’innovation, et à Alberta Enterprise Corporation. » Jason Kenney, premier ministre    Renseignements connexes  Alberta’s Recovery Plan (plan de relance de l’Alberta; en anglais seulement) Support for Alberta’s Recovery Plan (PDF) (soutien du plan de relance de l’Alberta; en anglais seulement) Economic Statement (PDF) (énoncé économique; en anglais seulement) Economic Recovery Council (conseil de relance économique; en anglais seulement) Blueprint for Jobs (plan d’action pour l’emploi; en anglais seulement) COVID-19 Information for Albertans (renseignements sur la COVID-19 pour les Albertains et les Albertaines; en anglais seulement)    Multimédia  Voir la photo de l’événement Écouter la conférence de presse (en anglais seulement) Regarder la conférence de presse (en anglais seulement)     Media inquiries                                               Christine Myatt                                           780-446-2179 Deputy Director of Communications/Press Secretary, Office of the Premier    "

Until now, Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba had separate processes and systems for corporations and limited partnerships to complete their extra-provincial business registrations and maintenance filings. On June 27, the four provinces were the first to implement the online Multi-jurisdictional Registry Access Service (MRAS), a hub that allows corporate information sharing between the provinces, making extra-provincial registration faster and easier.  “The launch of this online service is just one of the ways we are cutting red tape for businesses, which is especially important as we relaunch our economy. MRAS is convenient and efficient, and makes it easier for Alberta job creators to expand their operations across Western Canada and for western Canadian job creators to grow into Alberta.” Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta  As members of the New West Partnership Trade Agreement, the four western provinces committed to reconciling business registration and reporting requirements between the jurisdictions, thus simplifying extra-provincial business registration processes.  “We are always pleased to reduce red tape and make it easier for businesses to register and set up operations in Saskatchewan and Western Canada.” Don Morgan, Minister of Justice and Attorney General, Government of Saskatchewan  Through MRAS, other jurisdictions will eventually be able to share corporate information, thus extending the New West Partnership’s efficiencies across Canada.   “Manitoba is eager to work with our western neighbours under the New West Partnership Agreement and find ways to make life easier for business owners. A priority for our government is to reduce red tape and this is another way we are able to do so and improve economic trade across Western Canada.” Scott Fielding, Minister of Finance, Province of Manitoba   “People using this new service will find it easier to register their business in multiple provinces, and efficiently complete necessary paperwork through one central hub. This joint effort under the New West Partnership Agreement streamlines trade between our provinces and opens up the possibility of including other provinces and territories in the future.” Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services, Province of British Columbia    “We are pleased to see the western provinces move ahead with the Multi-jurisdictional Registry Access Service and reduce the regulatory burden on businesses who operate within different provinces. Today’s announcement is one step in the right direction on creating a more open interprovincial trade environment in Canada. It is encouraging to see these provinces move on this key recommendation CFIB made to the Canada Free Trade Agreement.” Marilyn Braun-Pollon, vice-president, Western Canada & Agri-business, CFIB     Quick facts  MRAS allows jurisdictions to share corporate information so corporations and limited partnerships can complete and update their extra-provincial registration online.

The Small and Medium Enterprise Relaunch Grant offers financial assistance to Alberta businesses, cooperatives, and non-profit organizations that faced restrictions or closures from public health orders, and experienced a revenue loss of at least 50 per cent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible job creators can apply for up to $5,000 through this program. This relief for businesses and non-profits can be used to offset the costs they are facing as they reopen their doors. This includes the costs of implementing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as physical barriers, PPE and cleaning supplies, as well as rent, employee wages, replacing inventory and more.  “Small- and medium-sized businesses are job creators. They employ hundreds of thousands of Albertans and are the backbone of our economy. That’s why we are taking further action to support them as we relaunch our economy and get folks back to work. This builds on Alberta’s nation-leading support for job creators, and will help businesses, cooperatives and non-profits get Albertans working and our economy back on track.” Tanya Fir, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism   “We continue to hear from small businesses that although they are now fully open, it is not business as usual – with only 20 per cent making normal or better revenues for this time of year. This program will help small businesses in the economic relaunch phase who are struggling to pay for fixed costs such as rent and additional new costs like PPE.” Annie Dormuth, Alberta provincial affairs director, Canadian Federation of Independent Business   “Businesses continue to struggle with the additional costs of getting their businesses – and therefore Alberta’s economy – back up and running. This grant program is very much appreciated and welcomed by small- and medium-sized businesses.” Ken Kobly, president and CEO, Alberta Chambers of Commerce   “Prior to COVID-19, our Thursday buffet was our busiest day. With the help of the funding, we plan to purchase equipment to turn our self-serve buffet into a closed buffet so we can continue to offer this experience to our guests, just with adjustments to serving style.” Done Philip, owner, PDS Restaurant in Brooks   “We will be using the funds to purchase personal protective equipment for our staff and facilities to ensure our customers feel safe when they come back to our businesses.” Peter and Kamal Sandhu, owners, Care Edmonton Inc., and Care Beauty Spa & Hair Inc. in Edmonton  To be eligible, small- and medium-sized businesses, cooperatives and non-profits must have 500 or fewer employees. The program has a budget of $200 million. Application intake will open at 10 a.m. on June 29, and remain open until Aug. 31, or for four weeks following the start of stage three of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy – whichever is later. To manage the expected volume of applications, during the first week of application intake (June 29 to July 3), a specific application day has been designated for specific regions of the province. During this time, applicants are encouraged to apply on the application day that is specified for their region. Beginning July 4, businesses, cooperatives and non-profits from all regions may apply at any time until application intake closes. Full program details, including additional eligibility criteria, application days by region, and how to apply, are outlined in the program guidelines. A program web page and online application portal will launch on alberta.ca when application intake opens at 10 a.m. on June 29. Quick facts  Many businesses have experienced a dramatic decrease in revenues, while other businesses have temporarily ceased operations as a result of COVID-19. An Alberta Chambers of Commerce survey conducted in May found that affordability of PPE and sanitization materials is an issue for 22 per cent of businesses.    Related information  Small and Medium Enterprise Relaunch Grant program guidelines      Dès le 29 juin, les petites et moyennes entreprises, les coopératives et les organismes sans but lucratif admissibles peuvent présenter une demande de financement afin d’ouvrir leurs portes et de permettre aux Albertains et aux Albertaines de retourner travail. La subvention pour la relance des petites et moyennes entreprises est une aide financière aux entreprises, coopératives et organismes sans but lucratif de l’Alberta qui ont été soumis à des restrictions et à des fermetures imposées par des ordonnances de santé publique et ont subi une perte de revenus d’au moins 50 % en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19. Les créateurs d’emplois admissibles peuvent demander jusqu’à 5 000 $ au titre de ce programme. Cette aide aux entreprises et aux organismes sans but lucratif peut être utilisée pour compenser les coûts associés à la reprise de leurs activités. Il s’agit notamment des coûts des mesures visant à prévenir la propagation de la COVID-19, comme les barrières physiques, l’équipement de protection individuelle, les fournitures de nettoyage, les loyers, les salaires des employés, le remplacement des stocks, etc.  « Les propriétaires de petites et moyennes entreprises créent des emplois. Ils emploient des centaines de milliers d’Albertains et d’Albertaines et constituent le pilier de notre économie. C’est pourquoi nous prenons des mesures supplémentaires pour les soutenir dans le cadre de la relance notre économie et du retour au travail de la population active. Cette démarche vient renforcer le soutien que l’Alberta accorde aux créateurs d’emplois, l’un des plus importants au pays. Les Albertains et les Albertaines pourront ainsi reprendre le travail dans ces entreprises, coopératives et organismes sans but lucratif et contribuer au rétablissement de l’économie. » Tanya Fir, ministre du Développement économique, du Commerce et du Tourisme   « Les propriétaires de petites entreprises continuent de nous dire que, malgré la reprise complète de leurs activités, tout n’est pas comme avant, car seulement 20 % d’entre eux enregistrent des recettes normales ou supérieures pour cette période de l’année. Ce programme aidera les propriétaires de petites entreprises en phase de relance économique qui peinent à payer des coûts fixes comme leur loyer et des coûts supplémentaires inédits comme l’équipement de protection individuelle. » Annie Dormuth, directrice des affaires provinciales de l’Alberta, Fédération canadienne de l’entreprise indépendante   « Les propriétaires d’entreprises peinent encore à assumer les coûts supplémentaires associés à la reprise de leurs activités, et donc de l’économie de l’Alberta. Ce programme de subventions est très apprécié et accueilli favorablement par les propriétaires de petites et moyennes entreprises. » Ken Kobly, premier dirigeant, Alberta Chambers of Commerce (chambre de commerce de l’Alberta)   « Avant la pandémie de COVID-19, notre buffet du jeudi correspondant à notre journée la plus chargée. Grâce au financement, nous allons acheter du matériel pour transformer notre buffet libre-service en buffet fermé afin de pouvoir continuer à proposer cette expérience à nos clients, tout en adaptant le style de notre service. » Done Philip, propriétaire, PDS Restaurant à Brooks   « Nous utiliserons les fonds pour acheter de l’équipement de protection individuelle pour notre personnel et nos installations, afin que nos clients se sentent en sécurité lorsqu’ils reviendront dans nos établissements. » Peter et Kamal Sandhu, propriétaires, Care Edmonton Inc. et Care Beauty Spa & Hair Inc. à Edmonton  Pour être admissibles, les petites et moyennes entreprises, les coopératives et les organismes sans but lucratif doivent compter 500 employés ou moins. Le programme dispose d’un budget de 200 millions de dollars. Les demandes pourront être déposées à partir de 10 h le 29 juin et jusqu’au 31 août, ou pendant quatre semaines après le début de la troisième étape de la Stratégie de relance de l’Alberta, selon la date la plus tardive. Pour gérer le volume prévu de demandes, chaque journée de la première semaine du programme (du 29 juin au 3 juillet) sera consacrée aux demandes émanant de régions précises de la province. Pendant cette période, les entreprises sont encouragées à déposer leur demande le jour réservé à leur région. À partir du 4 juillet, les entreprises, les coopératives et les organismes sans but lucratif de toutes les régions pourront déposer leur demande à tout moment, et ce, jusqu’à la clôture de la période de présentation des demandes. Les détails complets du programme, y compris les critères d’admissibilité supplémentaires, les dates réservées aux régions et les modalités de dépôt des demandes, sont précisés dans les lignes directrices du programme (en anglais seulement). Une page Web sur programme et un portail de demande en ligne seront lancés dans alberta.ca lorsque la réception des demandes débutera à 10 h le 29 juin. En bref  De nombreuses entreprises ont connu une baisse spectaculaire de leurs revenus, tandis que d’autres ont temporairement cessé leurs activités en raison de la COVID-19. Une enquête de l’Alberta Chambers of Commerce menée en mai a permis de révéler que le prix de l’équipement de protection individuelle et du matériel d’assainissement était un problème pour 22 % des entreprises.

Our focus on multiculturalism encourages Albertans to learn more about each other, celebrate our cultural diversity, and acknowledge the work that must be done to fight racism and build a province where all people feel safe, welcome and valued. “Multiculturalism and anti-racism work hand in hand to target the root causes of discrimination: fear of the unknown and intolerance. By learning more about the diverse cultures in Alberta, we discover unity in our shared values. After all, we all want a safe home for our families and the opportunity to succeed. “Recent events have shown us that this is especially important in addressing the barriers that exist in our workplaces, schools and public spaces. “On Canadian Multiculturalism Day, I encourage all Albertans to celebrate their heritage and share their traditions. This kind of sharing helps create connections and strong communities, which will be crucial for us in ending the scourge of racism and working together to continue to build a strong, resilient, and compassionate future for our province.”  Madame Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine, a fait la déclaration suivante à l'occasion de la Journée canadienne du multiculturalisme : « C'est la première fois en 25 ans que le gouvernement de l'Alberta compte un ministère consacré au multiculturalisme, car ce gouvernement a compris que notre diversité nous rend plus forts. L'accent que nous mettons sur le multiculturalisme encourage les Albertains et les Albertaines à mieux se connaître, à célébrer leur diversité culturelle et à reconnaître le travail qui doit être accompli pour vaincre le racisme et bâtir une province où tous et toutes se sentent valorisés, en sécurité et les bienvenus. « Le multiculturalisme et la lutte contre le racisme travaillent main dans la main pour s’attaquer aux causes profondes de la discrimination, c’est-à-dire la peur de l'inconnu et l'intolérance. En apprenant à mieux connaître les diverses cultures de l'Alberta, nous découvrons des valeurs communes qui nous unissent. Tout ce que nous voulons tous et toutes, après tout, c’est un foyer sécuritaire pour nos familles et une chance de réussir. « Les événements récents nous ont montré que cela est particulièrement important pour lever les obstacles qui existent dans nos lieux de travail, nos écoles et nos espaces publics. « En cette Journée canadienne du multiculturalisme, j'encourage tous les Albertains et toutes les Albertaines à célébrer leur héritage et à partager leurs traditions. Ce partage contribue à créer des liens et des communautés fortes, éléments cruciaux pour l’ensemble de notre population dans la lutte contre le fléau du racisme et dans la collaboration qui nous permettra de bâtir un avenir sûr, rempli de résilience et de compassion, pour notre province. »    Multimedia  Watch Minister Aheer and Premier Kenney's video     Media inquiries                                               Michael Forian                                           780-220-1267 Press Secretary, Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women    "

Anyone can become ill from this virus. Older Albertans and those with heart disease, diabetes or other underlying medical conditions are the most at risk of experiencing severe health outcomes. To date, 139 of the 154 deaths reported in Alberta were individuals over the age of 70. Almost 90 per cent of those who died from COVID-19 had two or more underlying conditions.  “Albertans have faced COVID-19 as they do any other obstacle –  head-on, with grit and determination. Our government will continue providing unprecedented support for vulnerable groups, but we need everyone to act responsibly and encourage others to do the same. Simple actions save lives, so let’s all keep doing our part.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “COVID-19 is still a threat to Alberta. We are extending critical supports put in place to protect those most at risk, including residents in continuing care facilities. This includes provincewide funding to help cover costs arising from COVID-19 protective measures and help seniors to remain safe at home.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health   “Every one of us acts as a shield that protects our friends, families and neighbours from this virus. By taking simple, everyday actions, we can help limit the spread, particularly to those most at risk of COVID-19. Every time we step out the door, we should ask ourselves: ‘Who am I protecting today?’” Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health  Strong protections across the province Government is extending the robust supports put in place during the spring to protect at-risk Albertans. This includes $14.2 million a month – and more than $170 million total – in additional funding to help keep residents and staff safe in long-term care, designated supportive living facilities and seniors lodges. Funding will continue until the orders from Alberta's chief medical officer of health are lifted. It is being distributed in coordination with Alberta Health Services and Seniors and Housing. Operators are using this money to pay for enhanced staffing and extra cleaning supplies, and to address lost accommodation revenue. Long-term care and designated supportive living operators have already received $38.7 million. The wage top-up of an additional $2 per hour for health-care aides at contracting continuing care facilities will also continue, along with funds to increase staffing levels, at a cost of $7.3 million a month. Other recent investments for at-risk Albertans include:  $500 million in additional funding for Budget 2020 to support Alberta’s health system during the pandemic.   $30 million to charities, not-for-profits, food banks and civil society organizations to support their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. $25 million to expand shelter space across the province to protect Albertans experiencing homelessness and allow for physical distancing. $21.6 million to expand online resources and virtual supports for Albertans seeking help for mental health and addiction challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. $5 million for women’s emergency shelters to support women and children fleeing violence to ensure they are protected and have access to safe isolation with supports.  Additional measures to support at-risk populations A number of other targeted measures will also continue until further notice, including:  Asymptomatic testing for all Albertans, including at all locations with outbreaks and all continuing care facilities. Mandatory protections for staff and residents at continuing care facilities, including continuous staff masking, staff screening, and restrictions on staff working at more than one facility. Enhanced outbreak protocols and infection prevention and control measures for all continuing care facilities and independent seniors living facilities. Strengthened protections at residential addiction treatment facilities, including screening protocols for residents and staff, enhanced cleaning and outbreak reporting requirements. Almost 20 million free non-medical masks distributed to Albertans in June, with another 20 million to be released in July. Expanded monitoring of licensed supportive living and long-term care settings to ensure compliance to protocols and standards.  Government is now engaging with those most at risk of severe outcomes to hear their ideas on what restrictions can be safely relaxed while still protecting them from infection. This includes seniors, senior-serving organizations, and disability groups. Remember who you’re protecting While these measures are vital, the most effective way to protect at-risk individuals is through collective action that makes our communities safe for all. Leaders from the worlds of sports, music, media, and government in Alberta have come together in a new video encouraging Albertans to ‘remember who you’re protecting.’ By taking simple, everyday actions, we can all protect our family, friends and neighbours, particularly those most at risk of COVID-19. Stay home if you are sick, get tested, practise physical distancing, wear a non-medical mask when you can’t, and wash your hands regularly. Albertans who may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 can also take steps to protect themselves. Follow the public health guidance provided, and talk to your health-care provider about specific ways to support your well-being. Quick facts about at-risk populations in Alberta  The average age of a death from COVID-19 is 83. All Albertans over the age of 80 face the same risk of death from a COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether they live in continuing care or the community. The average age for hospitalization from COVID-19 is 60. About 90 per cent of deaths linked to COVID-19 were individuals over the age of 70. About 90 per cent of Albertans who died from COVID-19 had two or more underlying conditions. About 47 per cent of Albertans admitted to ICU had two or more pre-existing conditions. About one in 11 Albertans (more than 381,000 people) are 70 years or older. About 37,000 Albertans reside in long-term care, designated supportive living and seniors lodges.  Quick facts about COVID-19  There are currently 509 active cases and 7,225 recovered cases. There have been 154 deaths linked to COVID-19 in Alberta. There are 14 active cases and 731 recovered cases at continuing care facilities; 117 facility residents have died. Alberta continues to lead all provinces in per-capita testing, with 422,351 tests completed.

N’importe qui peut tomber malade à cause du virus de la COVID-19. Les personnes âgées et celles souffrant de maladies cardiaques, de diabète ou d’autres problèmes de santé sous-jacents sont les plus à risque de souffrir de graves problèmes de santé. À ce jour, 139 des 154 personnes décédées recensées en Alberta avaient plus de 70 ans. Près de 90 % des personnes décédées de la COVID-19 souffraient de deux affections sous-jacentes ou plus.  « La population albertaine a abordé la COVID-19 comme elle l’aurait fait pour toute autre épreuve, c’est-à-dire de front, avec courage et détermination. Notre gouvernement continuera d’apporter un soutien sans précédent aux groupes vulnérables, mais nous avons besoin que chacun agisse de manière responsable et encourage les autres à faire de même. Des actions simples sauvent des vies, alors continuons de collaborer. » Jason Kenney, premier ministre   « La COVID-19 est toujours une menace pour l’Alberta. Nous étendons les mesures de soutien critiques mises en place pour protéger les personnes les plus à risque, y compris les résidents des établissements de soins de longue durée. Elles comprennent un financement provincial destiné à prendre en charge une partie des coûts engendrés par les mesures de protection contre la COVID-19 et à aider les personnes âgées à rester chez elles en sécurité. » Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé   « Chacun de nous est un rempart qui protège ses amis, sa famille et ses voisins contre le virus. En respectant des mesures simples au quotidien, nous pouvons aider à limiter la propagation de la COVID-19, en particulier chez les populations les plus à risque. Chaque fois que nous sortons, nous devrions nous demander qui nous protégeons aujourd’hui. » Dre Deena Hinshaw, médecin-hygiéniste en chef  Des mesures de protection rigoureuses dans toute la province Le gouvernement étend les mesures de soutien fortes prises au printemps pour protéger les Albertains et les Albertaines à risque. Ces mesures comprennent 14,2 millions de dollars par mois – et plus de 170 millions de dollars au total – en fonds supplémentaires pour aider à assurer la sécurité des résidents et du personnel des établissements de soins de longue durée, des établissements d’aide à la vie autonome et des foyers pour personnes âgées. Le financement sera maintenu jusqu’à ce que les ordonnances de la médecin-hygiéniste en chef de l’Alberta soient levées. Les fonds sont distribués en coordination avec l’Alberta Health Services (services de santé de l’Alberta) et le ministère des Aînés et du Logement (Seniors and Housing). Les exploitants utilisent ces fonds pour renforcer leurs effectifs et acheter des fournitures de nettoyage supplémentaires, mais aussi pour compenser la perte de revenus d’hébergement. Les exploitants des établissements de soins de longue durée et d’aide à la vie autonome ont déjà reçu 38,7 millions de dollars. Le complément de salaire de 2 $ l’heure accordé aux préposés aux aides en soins de santé dans les établissements de soins de longue durée sera également maintenu, tout comme le financement destiné à soutenir l’augmentation des effectifs, pour un coût de 7,3 millions de dollars par mois. D’autres investissements ont récemment été faits en faveur des Albertains et des Albertaines à risque :  500 millions de dollars de financement supplémentaire pour le budget de 2020 afin de soutenir le système de santé de l’Alberta pendant la pandémie;   30 millions de dollars pour des organismes de bienfaisance, des organismes sans but lucratif, des banques alimentaires et des organisations de la société civile pour appuyer leur lutte contre la pandémie de COVID-19; 25 millions de dollars pour mettre à disposition plus d’espace pour les refuges dans toute la province, afin de protéger les personnes sans abri et d’assurer l’éloignement physique; 21,6 millions de dollars pour élargir les ressources en ligne et les mesures de soutien virtuelles pour les Albertains et les Albertaines qui ont des problèmes de santé mentale et de toxicomanie en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19 et qui cherchent de l’aide; 5 millions de dollars pour les refuges d’urgence réservés aux femmes afin de protéger les femmes et les enfants fuyant la violence et de leur garantir un isolement sécuritaire avec du soutien.  Mesures supplémentaires en faveur des populations à risque Plusieurs autres mesures ciblées seront également maintenues jusqu’à nouvel ordre, notamment :  les tests de dépistage pour toutes les personnes asymptomatiques, y compris partout où des éclosions se sont produites et dans tous les établissements de soins de longue durée; les mesures de protection obligatoires pour le personnel et les résidents des établissements de soins de longue durée, y compris le port du masque en continu par le personnel, le dépistage du personnel et les restrictions imposées au personnel travaillant dans plusieurs établissements; l’amélioration des protocoles en cas d’éclosion et des mesures de prévention et de contrôle des infections pour tous les établissements de soins de longue durée et les établissements pour personnes âgées autonomes; le renforcement des mesures de protection dans les établissements résidentiels de traitement de la toxicomanie, y compris les protocoles de dépistage pour les résidents et le personnel, le renforcement des exigences de nettoyage et de déclaration des éclosions; près de 20 millions de masques non médicaux gratuits ont été distribués à la population albertaine en juin, et 20 millions supplémentaires devraient être distribués en juillet; la surveillance accrue des établissements agréés d’aide à la vie autonome et de soins de longue durée pour assurer la conformité aux protocoles et aux normes.  Les membres du gouvernement communiquent actuellement avec les personnes les plus à risque de contracter une infection grave pour recueillir leur avis sur les restrictions qui peuvent être assouplies en toute sécurité tout en les protégeant de l’infection. Cette initiative vise les aînés, les organisations de services aux aînés et les groupes de personnes en situation de handicap. N’oubliez pas qui vous protégez Bien que ces mesures soient essentielles, le moyen le plus efficace de protéger les personnes à risque est d’agir collectivement pour rendre nos collectivités sûres pour tous. Des chefs de file du monde du sport, de la musique, des médias et du gouvernement de l’Alberta ont participé à la réalisation d’une nouvelle vidéo encourageant les Albertains et les Albertaines à ne pas oublier qui ils protègent. En appliquant des mesures simples au quotidien, nous pouvons tous protéger notre famille, nos amis et nos voisins de la COVID-19, en particulier ceux qui sont le plus à risque. Restez chez vous si vous êtes malade, subissez un test de dépistage, respectez les consignes d’éloignement physique ou portez un masque non médical dans le cas contraire, et lavez-vous les mains régulièrement. Les Albertains et les Albertaines qui pourraient être particulièrement vulnérables face à la COVID-19 peuvent également prendre des mesures pour se protéger. Suivez les consignes de santé publique qui vous sont données, et discutez avec votre professionnel de la santé des moyens précis de favoriser votre bien-être. Quelques faits sur les populations à risque en Alberta  L’âge moyen des personnes décédées de la COVID-19 est de 83 ans. Tous les Albertains et les Albertaines de plus de 80 ans courent le même risque de mourir de la COVID-19, qu’ils vivent dans un établissement de soins de longue durée ou au sein de la communauté. L’âge moyen des personnes hospitalisées à cause de la COVID-19 est de 60 ans. Environ 90 % des personnes décédées en lien avec la COVID-19 étaient des personnes de plus de 70 ans. Près de 90 % des Albertains et des Albertaines décédés de la COVID-19 souffraient de deux affections sous-jacentes ou plus. Environ 47 % des Albertains et des Albertaines admis en soins intensifs souffraient au moins de deux affections préexistantes. Environ 1 personne sur 11 en Alberta est âgée de 70 ans ou plus (c.-à-d. plus de 381 000 personnes). Environ 37 000 Albertains et Albertaines résident dans des établissements de soins de longue durée, des établissements d’aide à la vie autonome et des foyers pour personnes âgées.  Quelques faits sur la COVID-19  On recense actuellement 509 cas actifs et 7 225 cas guéris. Il y a eu 154 décès associés à la COVID-19 en Alberta. On comptabilise 14 cas actifs et 731 cas guéris dans les établissements de soins de longue durée et 117 résidents de ces établissements sont décédés. L’Alberta continue de devancer toutes les provinces au chapitre du nombre de tests effectués par habitant, avec 422 351 tests effectués.

The contract for the final portion of the West Calgary Ring Road has been awarded to Calgary Safelink Partners for $277 million. Construction will get underway this summer on the south portion of the road, which is expected to be completed in 2024.  “The ring road is a critical project that has been years in the making and Calgarians have been waiting decades for it to be completed. When construction wraps up, the ring road will provide more than 100 kilometres of free-flow travel, making it faster and easier for Calgarians and job creators to get around Alberta’s largest city. Most importantly, this major infrastructure project will help get Albertans back to work by supporting thousands of much-needed jobs.” Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation   “I know I speak for myself and the constituents of Calgary-West when I say that the completion of the Calgary Ring Road has been highly anticipated in our riding. The Calgary Ring Road is a necessary project that will bring greater efficiency and free flow of traffic to our city, and I eagerly await the final phase to begin construction this summer.” Mike Ellis, MLA for Calgary West   “This project is something that the people of Calgary-Bow have been looking forward to for some time. I am pleased to see that the final construction contract has been awarded and like many of my neighbours, I am eagerly looking forward to greater connectivity with the city and the province once the project has finished. Finishing the ring road will make life better for the people of Calgary-Bow.” Demetrios Nicolaides, Minister of Advanced Education and MLA for Calgary-Bow  Another milestone was recently marked by the completion of about 80 per cent of the Southwest Calgary Ring Road, which is on schedule to be completed in fall 2021. A portion of the road will open this fall. Quick facts  Budget 2020 allocated about $1.4 billion for the Calgary Ring Road. Once complete, the ring road will provide 101 kilometres of free-flow travel around Calgary, and its construction will support more than 8,000 jobs.  Southwest Calgary Ring Road  The Southwest Calgary Ring Road will connect Highway 8 and Macleod Trail. Construction began in 2016 and will be completed in 2021. A portion of the road between Glenmore Trail and Fish Creek Boulevard is expected to open to traffic in fall 2020.  West Calgary Ring Road  The West Calgary Ring Road connects Highway 8 and the Trans-Canada Highway. The West Calgary Ring Road will be completed in three sections:  	 North project (Trans-Canada Highway to Old Banff Coach Road) West Bow River Bridge project   South project (Old Banff Coach Road to Highway 8)   The South project is targeted for completion in 2024 due to delays in relocating the ENMAX utility line, which required Alberta Utilities Commission approval, as well as considerations for the COVID19 pandemic. Preparations for a new storm pond are complete, and girders have been installed on the new bridge for the Scenic Acres Link NW exit. The new Bow River Pathway is now open, and work continues on the Trans-Canada Highway and Valley Ridge Boulevard NW interchange.

Stage two of relaunch underway  Stage two of Alberta’s relaunch strategy is underway. More businesses, sport and recreation services are open. Some larger gatherings are permitted. Public health guidance must be followed. Stage three depends on success in stage two, determined by: active case numbers, infection rates, health-care system capacity based on numbers in hospital and intensive care. For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy. The relaunch status map shows the level of risk in regions and information about local health measures. It also shows the rate of COVID-19 cases and the number of active cases.  Asymptomatic testing at community pharmacies  Participating community pharmacies will soon offer testing to Albertans without symptoms and no known exposure to COVID-19, making it easier to access testing and help stop the spread. At first, the number of pharmacies offering testing is limited. People should call their pharmacy to find out if it offers testing, and to book a test.  Serology testing to track the spread  Alberta is investing $10 million in voluntary serology testing for targeted groups for past exposure. This will help measure the virus spread among people who never felt sick, or didn’t report it.  Access to justice  The Court of Queen’s Bench is scheduling more previously postponed matters. For details, visit https://albertacourts.ca/qb/resources/announcements.

This included launching a public inquiry into the existence of a well-funded foreign campaign aimed at discrediting Alberta’s energy sector – a campaign which is alleged to have robbed the people of Alberta of billions of dollars in lost revenues and thousands of jobs. “The commissioner’s initial findings have shown that additional time and work is required to complete the final report. This extension will allow the commissioner to fairly and justly complete the inquiry process and follow up on the materials discovered to date. Due diligence cannot, and will not, be sacrificed on an issue this important to the future of our province and country. “As such, we have extended the commissioner’s deadline to submit his final report from July 2 to Oct. 30. To align with this additional time, we are also re-allocating $1 million from the Canadian Energy Centre’s 2020-21 budget to complete the inquiry. “How Alberta – and Canada – come through this economic crisis depends in large part on the survival and successful recovery of our energy sector. This sector helps some of our country’s most important industries thrive – including health care, manufacturing and transportation – and the revenue it generates supports the public services Canadians rely on. We look forward to the recommendations of the commissioner. We will do whatever it takes to support one of Canada’s most important industries, as we set a path towards economic recovery and renewed prosperity.”  Media inquiries                                               Kavi Bal                                           780-818-2710 Senior Press Secretary, Energy    "

A limited number of community pharmacies will begin to offer testing to Albertans without symptoms and no known exposure to COVID-19. This is in addition to the robust COVID-19 testing already offered by Alberta Health Services. Alberta remains among the world leaders in COVID-19 testing per capita. More than 415,000 tests have been completed across the province.  “Alberta is a world leader in testing, and this will further expand our capacity. By gradually expanding COVID-19 testing in community pharmacies, we continue to put safety first as we reopen the economy and get Albertans back to work. This is a key part of Alberta's relaunch strategy and will help us continue protecting Albertans from this virus.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health   “Our testing data has shown that the vast majority of Albertans who have gone for testing without symptoms or known exposure to COVID have tested negative. This is encouraging. Whether you have symptoms or not, please consider getting tested. You are helping us understand more about the spread of COVID-19 in Alberta.”  Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health    “Pharmacist practitioners prescribe, vaccinate, and will now be able to administer COVID-19 tests for asymptomatic individuals.  Pharmacists volunteering to offer COVID-19 testing further acknowledges the vital role they continue to play in the delivery of public health care, helping to keep our communities safe and enhancing the fight against COVID-19.” Margaret Wing, CEO, Alberta Pharmacists’ Association  Over the next few days, a group of 20 community pharmacies located primarily in Edmonton and Calgary will begin to offer testing. The pharmacy test is a throat swab, which is sent to Alberta Precision Labs for analysis. The number of pharmacies initially conducting COVID-19 testing is being limited to ensure the processes and flow of test materials and data is working well before expanding further. Additional pharmacies are planning to offer testing in the coming weeks. Albertans are encouraged to talk to their local pharmacist to see if testing is available. Each participating pharmacy will adhere to strict protocols and has the specialized skills needed to protect patient safety.  All Albertans are encouraged to be tested, even if they don't have symptoms. In addition to participating pharmacies, anyone who wants to get tested can book an appointment online with the AHS assessment tool. Quick facts  Alberta has one of the highest COVID-19 testing rates in the world, and has performed more than 415,000 tests on more than 367,000 Albertans. Only those who are asymptomatic and have no known exposures to COVID-19 can be tested at participating pharmacies. Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms must complete the COVID-19 self-assessment or call Health Link 811. Test kits for pharmacies are being produced and analyzed by Alberta Precision Laboratories. AHS will directly contact any Albertan who tests positive to discuss the results, begin contact tracing and protect the public’s health.    Related information  COVID-19 info for Albertans COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool     L’Alberta offrira des tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 aux personnes asymptomatiques dans les pharmacies, ce qui permettra à la population albertaine d’accéder plus facilement aux tests et aidera à enrayer la propagation de la maladie. Un nombre limité de pharmacies commenceront à offrir des tests de dépistage aux Albertains et aux Albertaines sans symptômes ni exposition connue à la COVID-19. Cette mesure vient s’ajouter aux tests de dépistage rigoureux déjà offerts par l’Alberta Health Services (services de santé de l’Alberta). L’Alberta fait toujours partie des chefs de file mondiaux en matière de nombres de tests effectués en fonction du nombre d’habitants. Plus de 415 000 tests de dépistage ont déjà été effectués dans l’ensemble de la province.  « L’Alberta est un leadeur mondial en matière de tests de dépistage et cette mesure accroîtra davantage notre capacité. En élargissant progressivement les tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 aux pharmacies, nous continuons à accorder la priorité absolue à la sécurité, alors que nous relançons l’économie et que les Albertains et les Albertaines retournent au travail. Cette mesure est un élément clé de la stratégie de relance de l’Alberta qui nous aidera à continuer à protéger la population albertaine contre ce virus. » Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé   « Nos données sur les tests de dépistage ont montré que les tests étaient négatifs pour la grande majorité des Albertains et des Albertaines sans symptômes ou qui, à leur connaissance, n’avaient pas été exposés à la COVID. C’est encourageant. Que vous présentiez ou non des symptômes, envisagez de subir un test. Vous nous aidez à mieux comprendre la propagation de la COVID-19 en Alberta. » Dre Deena Hinshaw, médecin-hygiéniste en chef    « Les pharmaciens praticiens prescrivent, vaccinent et pourront désormais faire passer des tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 à des personnes asymptomatiques. Les pharmaciens qui se sont portés volontaires pour proposer des tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 reconnaissent, en outre, le rôle vital qu’ils continuent de jouer dans la prestation des soins de santé publique et qu’ils contribuent à assurer la sécurité de nos communautés et à renforcer la lutte contre la COVID-19. » Margaret Wing, directrice générale, Alberta Pharmacists’ Association (association des pharmaciens de l’Alberta)  Dans les prochains jours, un groupe de 20 pharmacies situées principalement à Edmonton et à Calgary commenceront à offrir des tests de dépistage. Le test effectué en pharmacie est un prélèvement de la gorge qui est envoyé aux laboratoires Alberta Precision Laboratories aux fins d’analyse. Avant de l’élargir davantage, nous limitons dans un premier temps le nombre de pharmacies effectuant les tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 afin de nous assurer du bon fonctionnement des processus de même que du flux de matériel nécessaire aux tests et des données qui y sont liées. D’autres pharmacies prévoient proposer des tests de dépistage au cours des prochaines semaines. Les Albertains et les Albertaines sont encouragés à s’informer auprès de leur pharmacien local pour savoir s’il effectue des tests de dépistage. Chaque pharmacie participante respectera des protocoles stricts et possède les compétences spécialisées nécessaires pour protéger la sécurité des patients. Tous les Albertains et toutes les Albertaines sont encouragés à subir un test, même s’ils ne présentent aucun symptôme. En plus des pharmacies participantes, toute personne qui souhaite subir un test peut prendre rendez-vous en ligne à l’aide de l’outil d’évaluation de l’Alberta Health Services (AHS assessment tool; en anglais seulement). En bref  L’Alberta a l’un des taux de tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 les plus élevés au monde et a effectué plus de 415 000 tests de dépistage sur plus de 367 000 Albertains et Albertaines. Seules les personnes asymptomatiques et sans exposition connue à la COVID-19 peuvent subir un test dans les pharmacies participantes.

Our government is here to help support communities and Albertans recover by providing funding for uninsurable losses and damages.” Jason Kenney, Premier  The funding will help communities recover from damages to infrastructure and property, and recover costs incurred during emergency operations, response and cleanup. Funding will also be available to residents and business owners for uninsurable losses caused by overland flooding.  “Government operates an objective process to determine DRP eligibility. Following that process, we are now in a position to move forward with disaster relief. This funding will help affected communities recover and rebuild from this disaster.” Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs  MLAs have been working tirelessly to respond to damage on the ground and assist residents with filing their insurance claims.  “We know the damage from this storm has been devastating to Calgary and area residents. Our government will stand with you as we rebuild and manage the impact of this extreme weather. This disaster recovery assistance will provide some relief and make a positive difference for affected Albertans and their families.” Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services  Uninsurable loss and damages Only uninsurable costs are eligible for funding under the Disaster Assistance Guidelines. Hail, sewer backup and insurance deductibles do not qualify under the program, as insurance coverage is considered reasonably and readily available for these issues. Damages caused by overland flooding are eligible for a disaster recovery program, however. Albertans are encouraged to work with their insurance providers for damages caused by the storm. For more information, call the Insurance Bureau of Canada at 1-844-227-5422, or visit them online. Individuals who have not chosen to insure their property or belongings, or those who do not have adequate insurance, will not be eligible to receive funding through the disaster recovery program. Information, application processes and updates on approved disaster recovery programs can be found online at Alberta.ca/DRP.

Premier Jason Kenney and Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions Jason Luan held a roundtable discussion this week to raise awareness of first responder mental health for PTSD Awareness Month with representatives from local first responder agencies and the HiMARC organization. HiMARC is receiving funding to develop web-based resources to build resilience among first responders and expand clinical trials using virtual reality to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among military members and veterans to a sample of other first responders, including law enforcement and health-care providers.  “First responders such as military members, law enforcement and other emergency services members have been on the front lines of our pandemic response. We are pleased to support HiMARC’s important work providing a platform for members of these groups to develop and practise resilience skills.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “Many Albertans need additional mental health supports during the pandemic, but none more so than our first responders. Our government is proud to support this program that seeks to provide resources and learning opportunities to help first responders and military members be ready to respond to emergencies at a moment’s notice.” Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions   “Edmonton Police Service members have played a key role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic so far. The stress and long hours can take a toll on officers. We are grateful to the Government of Alberta and we are pleased to be a partner organization with HiMARC and support this important work.” Dale McFee, chief of police, Edmonton Police Service  The Alberta government is providing $362,000 to HiMARC for this important work through the COVID-19 Mental Health and Addiction Action Plan – the largest of its kind in Canada.  “Military members, veterans and other first responders are at higher risk of developing PTSD through their work. HiMARC’s programs will help these heroes in our communities find effective treatment for this serious illness.” Brad Rutherford, MLA for Leduc-Beaumont, and Military Liaison   “HiMARC aims to enhance resilience, address trauma and mental health challenges when they arise, and facilitate successful return to work and life transitions.

The proposed changes will address those gaps, such as creating a level playing field for challengers and incumbents and more democratic elections for voters and citizens. The proposed changes were informed by an extensive consultation process with voters, community advocacy groups, elected officials, school board associations, municipalities and municipal associations.  “The next round of local elections will be critical for the future of Alberta. These changes are about levelling the playing field, so the best candidates for local office – regardless of where they stand on the political spectrum – are running and winning.” Kaycee Madu, Minister of Municipal Affairs   “AUMA and its members support many of these practical changes to the Local Authorities Election Act that enable fair, transparent elections. It is paramount that local elections remain local, and that amendments preserve the non-partisan, democratic processes that Albertans expect.” Barry Morishita, president, Alberta Urban Municipalities Association   “It is crucial that municipal elections focus on local issues and provide a level playing field for all candidates. The Local Authorities Election Act continues to be an important tool in supporting local democracy and strong municipal governance. RMA looks forward to working with members to implement changes to the act in advance of the upcoming 2021 municipal election.” Al Kemmere, president, Rural Municipalities of Alberta   “This legislation was updated in 2018, but those changes didn’t do a lot to help newcomers. As a previously unknown challenger who successfully defeated an incumbent by working extremely hard, I know first-hand how hard it is to break into local politics. These changes create hope and opportunity for all those seeking to represent their communities.” Jon Dziadyk, Ward 3 councillor, City of Edmonton   “Local leadership matters. These common-sense improvements will help level the playing field and remove barriers to entry. We need a diverse field of candidates to step forward to offer their leadership through our many present challenges. By reducing advantages for incumbents, and increasing financial oversight over large campaigns, Albertans will have more tools and better opportunity to hold their elected officials accountable. Alberta is set to have races that celebrate our full diversity and allow for the most competitive local elections in the country.” Jeromy Farkas, Ward 11 councillor, City of Calgary  Some of the proposed amendments to municipal and school board elections include:  Ensuring campaign surpluses over $1,000 are donated to charity, instead of requiring municipalities and school boards to open trust accounts to hold them – levelling the playing field for new candidates who may not have previously raised funds. Allowing Albertans to support and donate to as many candidates as they choose, up to $5,000 per candidate – ensuring those without public name recognition have more flexibility to raise funds and get their message out. Protecting freedom of speech for third-party advertisers, like unions and corporations, by removing the definition of “political advertising” from the act – creating more open debates on issues and policies. Allowing candidates to self-finance up to $10,000 a year for their campaigns. Increasing the limit that potential candidates can raise outside of the campaign period from $2,000 to $5,000 annually – allowing candidates, particularly newcomers, to take steps to increase public awareness earlier. Making it so candidates do not have to file any disclosures before election day, meaning they can spend their time on their main priority – running for office.  	 To increase transparency, candidates who receive contributions of $50,000 or who spend more than $50,000 will be required to have a chartered professional accountant review their financial statements before submitting them to the municipality or school board.    Quick facts  A surplus of less than $1,000 may be kept by the candidate and used at their discretion.  The electoral changes will be made as soon as possible to give municipalities and school boards time to prepare materials, candidate packages, municipal bylaws and procedures for the 2021 elections. If passed, Bill 29 will take effect on Sept. 1.

Proposed changes to the Vital Statistics Act would require anyone 18 years of age or older to submit to a criminal background check as part of their application to change their name. Those convicted of designated sexual offences under the Criminal Code will be ineligible to complete a legal change of name in Alberta. Designated offences include sexual exploitation, incest, aggravated sexual assault, child pornography, and others.    “Sexual crimes, especially against children, are truly heinous. Prohibiting these offenders from legally changing their names is yet another step we are taking to ensure the safety of Alberta families in our communities.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “Today, I’m issuing a call to action to my counterparts across the country to join us in closing this loophole. Survivors of sexual violence live with the effects of that trauma for the rest of their lives. We are making sure their offenders have to live under their own names.” Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta  Alberta already has some of the strongest legislation around name changes and these proposed changes will make it even stronger. Under existing rules, anyone applying for a legal change of name in Alberta must be fingerprinted and submit an RCMP fingerprint confirmation letter with their application. Despite this safeguard, convicted sex offenders have still been allowed to legally change their names, provided their applications met all legislated requirements.  “This legislation takes an important step forward for survivors by better recognizing the lifelong impacts they face and making their offenders face the consequences of their actions daily.” Sheldon Kennedy, survivor, advocate, and co-founder of Respect Group Inc.   “This legislation helps to keep our communities safe by preventing recidivism and ensuring that offenders continue to be held accountable for the harms they have committed.” Deb Tomlinson, chief executive officer, Association of Alberta Sexual Assault Services   “Any time a child walks through our doors, it means that they’ve been deeply hurt and that is unacceptable. We’re pleased to see the government taking steps to protect children and youth in our communities through this legislation.” Cheryl Diebel, chief executive officer, Zebra Child Protection Centre  Quick facts  Each year, about 4,000 Alberta residents complete a legal change of name. Under the existing rules, several requirements must be met:  	 The applicant must be an Alberta resident. The proposed name must meet requirements set out in the Vital Statistics Act. Applicants 12 years and older must submit electronic fingerprint confirmation letters with their applications (fingerprints are sent directly to RCMP in Ottawa). The applicant must provide acceptable government-issued identification, plus proof of current legal name and their proposed new name.   Under the Vital Statistics (Protecting Albertans from Convicted Sex Offenders) Amendment Act, anyone 18 years of age or older applying for a legal change of name in Alberta would also have to submit either a criminal record check or a police information check. Those convicted of designated offences listed in subsection 490.011(1) (a), (c), (c.1), (d), (d.1) and (e) of the Criminal Code of Canada would be banned for life from completing a legal change of name in Alberta. The Alberta government stopped publishing legal changes of name in the Alberta Gazette in 2016 out of concern for the safety of vulnerable Albertans like transgender persons and victims of domestic abuse.

The annual celebration in Canada, recognizing the patron saint of French Canadians, became tradition in the 1800s. “Today, French-speaking Albertans across the province celebrate Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day with lively music, dance and meals befitting of the cultures that make up la Francophonie. While these celebrations are affected by COVID-19, we can still reflect on the day and keep the thoughts and spirit of these celebrations in our hearts and minds as we look forward to celebrating together in years to come. “To all French-speaking Albertans, joyeuse Saint-Jean-Baptiste!” Leela Sharon Aheer, Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women   “Today, on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, it’s a wonderful opportunity to highlight the vitality of the Canadian Francophonie and the dynamism of the French language and cultures in Alberta. From Plamondon to Grande Prairie, from Fort McMurray to Lethbridge, communities across Alberta celebrate this important day and their joie de vivre. “French was the first European language spoken in Alberta and it remains the most widely spoken language after English. Although historically, much of Alberta's francophone population could trace its origins to Quebec and France, today francophones in Alberta come from across the country and around the world. This year’s celebrations have gone digital in many cases, which has allowed francophones from across the province to connect with one another and celebrate through our shared language. “I want to wish everyone a happy Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day!”  Laila Goodridge, parliamentary secretary for the Francophonie   Mesdames Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine, et Laila Goodridge, secrétaire parlementaire à la francophonie, ont émis la déclaration suivante à l'occasion de la Saint-Jean-Baptiste :  « Les colons français auraient célébré la Saint-Jean-Baptiste pour la première fois un 24 juin du début du 17e siècle. Au Canada, cette célébration annuelle en reconnaissance du saint patron des Canadiens français est devenue une tradition dans les années 1800. « Aujourd'hui, les Albertains et les Albertaines francophones de toute la province célèbrent la Saint-Jean-Baptiste en musique, en danse et en repas animés, adaptés aux cultures qui forment la francophonie de la province. Bien que les célébrations de cette année soient affectées par la COVID-19, rien ne nous empêche de nous pencher sur le sens de l’événement et faire vivre les pensées et l'esprit de ces célébrations dans nos cœurs et nos esprits tout en nous réjouissant à l’idée de célébrer ensemble dans les années à venir. « Je souhaite une bonne Saint-Jean-Baptiste à tous les Albertains et toutes les Albertaines francophones! »  Leela Sharon Aheer, ministre de la Culture, du Multiculturalisme et de la Condition féminine    « Aujourd'hui, la fête de la Saint-Jean-Baptiste nous offre une belle occasion de souligner la vitalité de la francophonie canadienne et le dynamisme de la langue et des cultures françaises en Alberta. De Plamondon à Grande Prairie, de Fort McMurray à Lethbridge, des communautés célèbrent cette journée importante et leur joie de vivre partout en Alberta. « Le français a été la première langue européenne parlée en Alberta, et elle demeure la langue parlée le plus couramment dans notre province après l'anglais. Bien qu'historiquement, une grande partie de la population francophone de l'Alberta ait pu trouver ses origines au Québec et en France, les francophones de l'Alberta viennent aujourd'hui de partout au pays et du monde entier. Cette année, bon nombre des célébrations sont passées au numérique, ce qui a permis aux francophones de toute la province de se connecter les uns aux autres pour célébrer dans leur langue. « Je souhaite à tous et à toutes une bonne Saint-Jean-Baptiste! » Laila Goodridge, secrétaire parlementaire à la francophonie   Media inquiries                                               Michael Forian                                           780-220-1267 Press Secretary, Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women    "

Some larger gatherings are permitted. Public health guidance must be followed. Stage three depends on success in stage two, determined by: active case numbers, infection rates, health-care system capacity based on numbers in hospital and intensive care. For more information, visit alberta.ca/RelaunchStrategy. The relaunch status map shows the level of risk in regions and information about local health measures. It also shows the rate of COVID-19 cases and the number of active cases.  Serology testing to track the spread  Alberta is investing $10 million in voluntary serology testing for targeted groups for past exposure. This will help measure the virus spread among people who never felt sick, or didn’t report it.  Access to justice  The Court of Queen’s Bench is scheduling more previously postponed matters. For details, visit https://albertacourts.ca/qb/resources/announcements.  Supporting Alberta businesses through relaunch  The Alberta Biz Connect web page has health and safety guidelines for general workplaces and specific industry sectors.

Serology testing is used to detect the presence of antibodies in a person’s blood, indicating that a person has been exposed to the COVID-19 virus in the past. This is different from the robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing already available to all Albertans, which is the most effective way to test if anyone currently has the virus. Alberta Health is investing in four voluntary public health studies, which will serologically test specific groups of Albertans for the virus. Alberta Health Services (AHS) will also make serology testing available for specific clinical purposes where testing can inform treatment decisions. Alberta is the first province in Canada to make this targeted serology testing available.  “We committed to investing in expanding COVID-19 testing as part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy. Investing in these focused studies of select groups will help us get a better sense of the situation in Alberta and learn more about the virus. The more we know about how COVID-19 is spreading, the better we can protect Albertans.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health   “We anticipate that there are people in the province who have been infected with COVID-19 and either were not tested, or were unaware that they had the virus. Investing in these representative public health studies will help us understand what percentage of Albertans have a history of infection, and how to improve our health response.” Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health   “Albertans’ collective efforts to follow public health guidelines have helped to significantly slow the spread of COVID-19 in our province. In addition to our robust testing efforts to detect positive cases, antibody testing is one more tool that will provide the critical data we need to monitor and track the virus within our communities.” Dr. Verna Yiu, president and CEO, Alberta Health Services  The $10-million investment will fund two pediatric studies that will measure COVID-19 antibody prevalence among groups of Calgary and Edmonton children until 2022. A third study will test samples from blood collected for other purposes across the province, and a fourth will regularly test select Albertans over the age of 45 to help officials better estimate the number of people exposed to COVID-19. By investing in serology studies, Alberta will be able to better estimate the number of people who have previously contracted COVID-19 and learn about how the virus is spreading over time. As well, Alberta Precision Laboratories will offer serology testing for specific clinical purposes and funded population-level serology research studies.   Related information  COVID-19 testing in Alberta AB3C study Alberta’s Tomorrow Project  CHILD Edmonton     L'Alberta investit 10 millions de dollars dans des tests sérologiques ciblés qui permettront de suivre la propagation de la COVID-19 dans la province. Les tests sérologiques servent à détecter la présence d'anticorps dans le sang et peuvent ainsi indiquer qu'une personne a déjà été exposée au virus de la COVID-19. Ces tests diffèrent du robuste test d'amplification en chaîne par polymérase (PCR), déjà offert à toute la population albertaine et qui constitue le moyen le plus efficace de vérifier si une personne est actuellement porteuse du virus. Le ministère de la Santé investit des fonds dans quatre études volontaires de santé publique, qui permettront de tester la sérologie de groupes spécifiques d'Albertains et d’Albertaines pour le virus. L’Alberta Health Services (services de santé de l'Alberta (AHS)) mettra également à disposition des tests sérologiques à des fins cliniques spécifiques dans le but d’éclairer les décisions de traitement. L'Alberta est la première province du Canada à offrir ce test sérologique ciblé.  « Nous nous sommes engagés à investir dans le développement d’autres tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 dans le cadre de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta. En investissant dans ces études ciblées sur des groupes sélectionnés, nous serons en mesure de mieux comprendre la situation en Alberta et d’en apprendre davantage sur le virus. Plus nous en saurons sur la manière dont la COVID-19 se propage, mieux nous pourrons protéger les Albertains et les Albertaines. » Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé   « Nous pensons qu'il y a des personnes dans la province qui ont été infectées par la COVID-19 sans le savoir ou sans avoir été testées. En investissant dans ces études représentatives de santé publique, nous aurons une meilleure idée du pourcentage d’Albertains et d’Aa population aoir été testées. lbertaines qui ont été infectées et de la façon dont nous pouvons améliorer nos interventions en matière de santé. » Dre Deena Hinshaw, médecin hygiéniste en chef   « Les efforts collectifs déployés par la population albertaine pour suivre les directives de santé publique ont contribué à ralentir considérablement la propagation de la COVID-19 dans notre province. En plus de nos solides efforts de dépistage, le test de dépistage des anticorps est un outil supplémentaire qui fournira les données essentielles dont nous avons besoin pour surveiller et suivre la propagation du virus au sein de nos communautés. » Dre Verna Yiu, présidente et directrice générale, Alberta Health Services  L'investissement de 10 millions de dollars financera deux études pédiatriques qui mesureront la prévalence des anticorps de la COVID-19 chez des groupes d'enfants de Calgary et d'Edmonton jusqu'en 2022. Une troisième étude analysera des échantillons de sang prélevés à d'autres fins dans toute la province, et dans le cadre d’une quatrième étude, les responsables testeront régulièrement des Albertains et Albertaines de plus de 45 ans afin de pouvoir mieux estimer le nombre de personnes exposées à la COVID-19. En investissant dans des études sérologiques, l'Alberta sera mieux en mesure d’estimer le nombre de personnes qui ont déjà contracté la COVID-19 en plus d'apprendre comment le virus se propage au fil du temps. En outre, les laboratoires Alberta Precision Laboratories proposeront des tests sérologiques à des fins cliniques spécifiques et financeront des études de recherche sérologique au sein de la population.

Aligning with the government’s commitment to review Alberta’s electricity agencies, Carolyn Dahl Rees, a current AUC commissioner, will serve as interim chair of the AUC for up to 12 months. She has extensive legal and regulatory experience within the electricity sector, including a previous term as acting chair and vice-chair of the AUC from 2008 to 2012. As interim chair, Dahl Rees will strengthen the Commission’s focus on streamlining regulatory processes and reducing red tape in order to provide more certainty to investors, the electricity market, and ultimately, consumers. The appointment takes effect June 24.  “The AUC has existed in its current form for 12 years, and it’s important we allow it to adapt, as necessary, to best serve Albertans. Ms. Dahl Rees is well qualified to provide leadership as the Commission modernizes its operations while continuing to focus on its core operations. I thank Mark Kolesar, the outgoing chair, for his service.” Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity  Government expects the AUC to strengthen its work through streamlining processes, reducing red tape, and increasing investor confidence in Alberta’s electricity sector. Government also looks forward to reviewing the findings of an AUC-established independent committee focused on improving the timeliness of its regulatory proceedings – including how processes and procedures can be eliminated or made more efficient. Quick facts  The AUC regulates Alberta’s utilities and natural gas and electricity markets to protect the social, economic and environmental interests of ratepayers where competitive market forces cannot. The AUC is responsible for ensuring that the delivery of Alberta's utility service is fair, responsible, and in the public interest.

This legislation will help us strengthen democracy and increase accountability, giving Albertans a louder voice and a direct impact on the actions of government.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “The Fair Deal Panel was clear – Albertans want a more direct say on important matters. Expanding what referendums can be held on would give Albertans the opportunity to have their say on matters that affect both their daily lives and the future of our province.” Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General  Referendums could be held on a number of government-led initiatives or matters of public interest before they are implemented, including the recommendations of the Fair Deal Panel. Referendums could be held alongside a provincial or municipal election, or be held separately or by mail-in ballot. Government also introduced Bill 27, the Alberta Senate Election Amendment Act.

Now that the public health emergency is no longer in effect and Alberta is reopening as part of our phase two relaunch, industry can resume business while keeping communities and employees safe.” Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks  Alberta Environment and Parks also authorized a three-month extension to industry to submit regulatory reports for emissions reduction achievements and renewable fuel operator compliance. These reports are due June 30. All documentation related to Water Act approvals and licences, reports for public land rentals, and reports related to Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act authorizations that were collected since the ministerial order was put in place must now be submitted. Drinking water facilities were not affected by the order and were still required to submit reports during the pandemic. Ministerial orders put in place by the Ministry of Energy are also being rescinded on July 15, earlier than anticipated.  “There is no higher priority than the safety of workers and the communities they work in. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic required us to operate under an abundance of caution during the height of the health emergency. While this pause was of low risk, it is also important that we maintain full confidence in the rigour of our regulatory system and return to all regular reporting activities as soon as it is safe to do so.

It’s another significant step in fulfilling our commitment to Albertans to protect the value of the province’s energy resources and attract new investment. “Overall, Keystone XL will support 17,000 Canadian workers, contribute $2.4 billion to Canada’s GDP and will generate an estimated $30 billion in revenues for future generations of Albertans and Canadians. “Once operational, the TC Energy project will provide North America with a stable, secure supply of crude oil, reducing reliance on supply from OPEC. The pipeline will carry 830,000 barrels per day of oil to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, where Western Canadian crude is in high demand. “We have been working closely with our U.S. partners at the state and federal level to strengthen North American energy security and independence. The overwhelming consensus is projects such as Keystone XL will play a vital role in the post-pandemic economic recovery of both our countries. “Construction of the Alberta portion of the pipeline will begin this summer near Oyen and finish near Hardisty in the spring of 2022.”  Media inquiries                                               Christine Myatt                                           780-446-2179 Deputy Director of Communications/Press Secretary, Office of the Premier    "

Thanks to the success of the program, we have paused the distribution of free non-medical masks at the three restaurant partners until the second phase in July. Albertans who have not received a mask can continue to call 211 to request a package. Alberta is the only province in Canada to make free non-medical masks available to help limit the spread of COVID-19. Another 20 million masks will be distributed in July, via drive-thrus and other partners. Details will be announced in the next couple of weeks.  “Thank you to all our partners for helping our government distribute millions of non-medical masks to every corner of Alberta. No other province in Canada has accomplished such a feat. A program of this scale would not have been possible without your hard work and community support. We will continue to support Albertans as we move through stage two of relaunch, and people continue to get back to work.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health  This initiative is a key part of Alberta’s Relaunch Strategy to safely reopen our economy while protecting Albertans from COVID-19. In addition to the masks shared via drive-thru windows, the Alberta government provided masks directly to:  Edmonton Transit, Calgary Transit, and municipalities without convenient access to a drive-thru First Nations and Metis Settlements Seniors organizations and independent living facilities Long-term care and permanent supportive living facilities Women’s shelters, homeless shelters and street outreach programs Addiction treatment centres Foster and kinship parents Albertans who contacted 211 and couldn’t access a drive-thru partner or the alternate municipal or community providers  The distribution of masks to municipalities without easy access to a drive-thru, First Nations, Metis Settlements and other local agencies will continue following the timelines set by those groups. As of June 19, government has received 1,000 requests for masks from places of worship across the province, and more than two million masks will be provided to them in the next few days for distribution to their congregations. Quick facts about the mask distribution  More than 20 million non-medical masks have or will soon be shared with Albertans. 14 million masks were shared through nearly 600 A&W, McDonald’s Canada, or Tim Hortons drive-thrus. About 95 per cent of Albertans live within 10 kilometres of the drive-thrus through which the masks were distributed. Mask use is not mandatory; they are an option for situations where maintaining a distance of two metres is not possible.

Six millions de masques supplémentaires ont été ou seront envoyés directement avec les municipalités, les organismes de personnes âgées, les Autochtones et les lieux de culte, entre autres, afin d’aider à limiter la propagation de la COVID-19. À la suite du succès du programme, nous avons interrompu la distribution de masques non médicaux gratuits dans les trois chaînes de restaurants partenaires jusqu'à la deuxième phase en juillet. Les Albertains et les Albertaines qui n'ont pas reçu de masques peuvent continuer de composer le 211 pour en commander un paquet. L'Alberta est la seule province canadienne à offrir des masques non médicaux gratuits pour aider à freiner la propagation de la COVID-19. Vingt millions de masques supplémentaires seront distribués en juillet aux services à l’auto et par l'intermédiaire d'autres partenaires. Les détails concernant la distribution seront annoncés dans les deux prochaines semaines.  « Nous remercions tous nos partenaires d'avoir aidé notre gouvernement à distribuer des millions de masques non médicaux dans tous les coins de l'Alberta. Aucune autre province du Canada n'a accompli un tel exploit. Un programme de cette envergure n'aurait pas été possible sans leur travail acharné et le soutien de la communauté. Nous continuerons à soutenir la population albertaine pendant la deuxième étape de la relance et à mesure que les gens retourneront au travail. » Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé  Cette initiative est un élément clé de la stratégie de relance de l'Alberta, qui vise à redresser l’économie en toute sécurité tout en protégeant les Albertains et Albertaines contre la COVID-19. En plus des masques distribués par l'intermédiaire des guichets de service à l’auto, le gouvernement de l'Alberta a fourni directement des masques aux communautés et organismes suivants :  les sociétés de transport d’Edmonton et de Calgary, et les municipalités qui n'ont pas d'accès pratique à un service à l’auto les premières nations et établissements métis les organismes de personnes âgées et centres de vie autonome les centres de soins de longue durée et les centres de soutien permanent les refuges pour femmes, les refuges pour sans-abri et les programmes de sensibilisation communautaires dans la rue les centres de traitement des toxicomanies les parents et les familles d'accueil les Albertains et les Albertaines qui ont contacté le 211 parce qu’ils n'ont pas pu accéder à un partenaire de service au volant ou aux autres fournisseurs municipaux ou communautaires  La distribution de masques aux municipalités qui n'ont pas facilement accès à un service à l’auto, aux Premières nations, aux établissements métis et à d'autres organismes locaux se poursuivra selon les échéances fixées par ces groupes. Au 19 juin, le gouvernement avait reçu 1 000 demandes de masques de lieux de culte situés dans toute la province, et plus de deux millions de masques seront fournis à ces endroits au cours des prochains jours pour être distribués au sein des congrégations. Quelques faits sur la distribution des masques  Plus de 20 millions de masques non médicaux ont été ou seront bientôt distribués au sein de la population albertaine. Quatorze millions de masques ont été distribués dans près de 600 restaurants A&W, McDonald's Canada et Tim Hortons. Environ 95 % des Albertains et des Albertaines vivent dans un rayon de 10 kilomètres d’un service à l’auto où les masques ont été distribués. L'utilisation des masques n'est pas obligatoire; il s’agit d’une option dans les situations où il n'est pas possible de maintenir une distance de deux mètres avec les autres.

An additional $4 million over four years will help expand access to the Virtual Opioid Dependency Program (VODP). The Alberta Health Services program uses telehealth technology to allow Albertans to access treatment for opioid use disorder. In addition to medical support, the VODP provides clients with addiction counselling and other supports including transitional services. The Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT) Gap Coverage program will cover the costs of medications to treat opioid use disorder for Albertans who are waiting to receive coverage through a supplementary health benefit plan. The program will cover costs for up to 120 days, during which an Albertan can apply for and receive supplementary health benefits.  “We’re creating pathways for recovery across the continuum of care for Albertans. The Virtual Opioid Dependency and OAT Gap Coverage programs are important tools to help people across the province get the treatment they need to recover and live healthy, successful lives.” Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions  The VODP has already proven effective at helping Albertans dealing with addiction. About 40 per cent of VODP clients over the past year reported an opioid overdose upon entering the program. After a year in the program, fewer than 10 per cent of clients reported an overdose. Albertans can be referred to the VODP by any community health-care provider or even refer themselves to the program. Once enrolled, patients have regular video conferencing visits with a doctor and other health professionals. Video conferencing visits can be arranged in any community in Alberta.  “Our clients come from many backgrounds and have, by and large, experienced a lot of hardship.  Despite this, clients and their families tell us that they are moving forward in recovery to lives they never thought they could have. It is critical that we meet people where they are at and remove obstacles to getting better. This program delivers high-quality addiction treatment to people when they need it, no matter where in Alberta they live or work. Our team collaborates with local supports, including those in community pharmacies, enabling people to access care as close to home as possible.“ Dr. Nathaniel Day, medical director, Addiction and Mental Health, VODP  VODP quick facts  The VODP is available province wide and has served more than 2,000 clients to date, including almost 1,300 in the past year. The program helps ensure smooth transitions for patients who are moving from one care setting to another (e.g., from hospital-based care to community-based care). The VODP was recently recognized by the Health Quality Council of Alberta for improving patients’ overall experience in accessing and receiving health-care services. The additional funding will also assist with increasing existing programming and service capacity. To learn more about the Virtual Opioid Dependency Program or refer yourself for treatment, call 1-844-383-7688.  The OAT Gap Coverage program covers all payments for buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone. These medications are used to treat opioid use disorder. They must be taken every day and can cost more than $10,000 per year for those without supplementary health benefits. OAT Gap Coverage Program quick facts  The program launched on April 1. Since then, more than 1,100 Albertans have been enrolled. Albertans must enrol in a supplementary health benefits plan to continue to receive coverage for OAT medications after the 120-day period covered by the program. The OAT Gap Coverage Program is funded through the Government of Canada’s Emergency Treatment Fund. Program funding this year is estimated to be about $2 million.

On May 17, a concrete drop structure failed on the St. Mary Canal, which is located in northern Montana and owned by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The canal diverts water from the St. Mary River to the Milk River. Permanent repairs to the canal will begin immediately, with completion scheduled for September. Repairs will be paid for by U.S. officials.  “We recognize the severity of the situation and the importance of the Milk River basin to surrounding communities and the local economy. Environment and Parks is supporting Alberta water users and working with our federal and U.S. counterparts to keep water users informed as work to repair the canal progresses.” Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks   “I want to assure my constituents in Taber-Warner that we are taking the situation along the Milk River very seriously. I will continue to meet with the local mayors, reeves and irrigators over the coming weeks and months as this situation continues to evolve.” Grant Hunter, MLA for Taber-Warner  Environment and Parks will support Alberta water users in the Milk River basin with an updated water supply outlook, updates on infrastructure repairs south of the border, details on allotments and water use by each country and support for water conservation planning, as necessary. With no canal in place, water licence holders in Alberta should be prepared for only natural flows on the Milk River throughout the summer and should proactively explore options for water conservation. Recreational users will also be impacted. Without diverted water via the St. Mary Canal, Milk River water levels will likely be too low this summer for activities like canoeing or kayaking. No impacts to drinking water or household use are expected. The province provided the Town of Milk River with funding to increase water storage. The town’s current stored water supply would support four months of water use in the event the town was unable to draw any more water from the river. Quick facts  Water use on both the St. Mary River and the Milk River are governed by the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. The accredited officers for the St. Mary and Milk rivers calculate natural flows and water usage by each country semi-monthly during the irrigation season, ensure deficits are balanced by Oct. 31, and resolve disputes, if necessary. During the irrigation season (April 1 to Oct. 31), Canada is entitled to 25 per cent of the natural flow of the Milk River, up to a natural flow of 18.9 cubic metres per second, and 50 per cent of natural flows above this threshold. On the St. Mary River, from which the St. Mary Canal diverts water, Canada is entitled to 75 per cent of natural flows up to 18.9 cubic metres per second during the irrigation season and 50 per cent of natural flows above this threshold. Natural flows are shared equally with the United States from Nov. 1 to March 31. The United States may accumulate a deficit on the St. Mary River from March 1 to May 31, which would be equalized through a Canadian entitlement to water on the Milk River transferred via the St. Mary Canal. The St. Mary Canal was constructed between 1907 and 1915.

Alberta families welcomed 51,598 babies in 2019 – 26,328 boys and 25,270 girls. Noah returned as the most popular boy’s name for the second time in three years, previously topping the list in 2017. For the seventh year in a row, Olivia was the most popular girl’s name. Other popular names for boys were Liam, Oliver, Ethan and Jack, while Charlotte, Sophia, Emma and Ava rounded out the top five names for girls.  “One of the most memorable moments for me as a new father was when my wife and I chose the name for our son last fall. Choosing a name for your child is fun and exciting. I want to congratulate all new parents in Alberta and reassure them, as well as Albertans expecting a child in the near future, that we are working every day to make sure your children have a great future in a strong Alberta.” Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta  Of the 13,718 different names recorded in 2019, some Alberta parents seem to have been inspired by popular culture, such as Game of Thrones (Khaleesi, Sansa, Brienne), Lord of the Rings (Arwen, Eowyn, Theoden), and Marvel comics (Loki, Rogue, Xavier-Charles). Some Alberta parents also selected names referencing Greek (Artemis, Apollo, Persephone, Zeus) and Roman (Juno, Mars, Venus, Neptune) mythology, while others chose names referring to geographic locations (Arizona, Memphis, Salem, Jerusalem). Quick facts  Notable changes to the 2019 lists:  	 Hannah reappeared on the Top 10 girls’ names list for the first time since 2014. Logan dropped to 12th place on the boys’ names list after appearing in the top five in 2017 and 2018. Harper dropped to 16th place on the girls’ names list after placing seventh in 2018.

It is a day to honour the unique histories and cultures of First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples. “Also on this day in 1899, Treaty 8 was signed in northern Alberta – the largest land treaty in our country’s history. Alberta respects the First Nations’ treaty relationship with the Crown, and we are proud of the government-to-government relationship we share. “Our government is committed to a better and more inclusive Alberta for all, which is why we are working to remove barriers to prosperity for Indigenous Peoples. More than 258,000 First Nations, Métis and Inuit people call Alberta home, and we’re confident their business acumen and vision will be instrumental in restoring our province’s economy. “By creating programs for community groups to invest in natural resource projects, like the Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation, we are helping to build a clearer path to economic reconciliation. “We are also walking side by side with communities toward social change, so current and future generations of Indigenous people can live free of culture- and gender-based harm. Celebrating a bright future depends on us all taking action today. “I encourage all Albertans to take the time to learn more about how Indigenous cultures and contributions have enriched the province we know today. The month of June provides many special opportunities to celebrate Indigenous people in Alberta.

The additional grant funding will support about 1,800 jobs in communities across Alberta.  “Albertans in every corner of the province are facing real challenges as our economy recovers from COVID-19 and our municipalities rely on strong local infrastructure to attract investment and grow their economies. As we move ahead with Alberta’s relaunch, this additional investment will go a long way to helping rural municipalities get back on their feet and back to work.” Jason Kenney, Premier   “We are taking the next step in Alberta’s economic recovery by significantly increasing funding for well-used infrastructure and water grant programs for our municipalities. This stimulus funding is just one part of our government’s economic recovery plan to get Albertans back to work. It makes sense to flow stimulus funding into our municipalities through existing programs that communities are familiar with, that build and rebuild roads, bridges, and water infrastructure that communities need constructed and fixed.” Ric McIver, Minister of Transportation   “Increased funding through key infrastructure grant programs is welcomed to support the construction and maintenance of needed municipal road and bridge infrastructure that Alberta’s industries rely on for access to natural resources and markets. Rural municipalities look forward to utilizing increased STIP funding for municipal infrastructure projects that will contribute to local economic growth and Alberta’s overall economic recovery.” Al Kemmere, president, Rural Municipalities of Alberta  Strategic Transportation Infrastructure Program (STIP) About $50 million in additional STIP funding will go to municipalities across Alberta to support 69 projects and about 480 jobs. The program funds bridge improvements, upgrades to resource roads and community airports and other municipal initiatives. Water Infrastructure Grants About $150 million will support 55 water and wastewater improvement projects and approximately 1,300 jobs.  $137 million allocated to the Alberta Municipal/Wastewater Partnership for 54 projects   $13 million to the First Nations Water Tie-in Program to support a water tie-in program for the Ermineskin Cree Nation to the Ponoka regional water pipeline.  Quick facts STIP  STIP grants funding is awarded in four categories: improvements to local bridges; community airports; resource roads for industrial use; and local municipal initiatives. These are cost-shared projects, with the province covering up to 75 per cent of the eligible cost. Projects are awarded based on initiatives identified by municipalities.  Water Infrastucture Grants  Grants support improvements to water supply and treatment facilities, and upgrades to wastewater services, including lagoons, berms and sewage treatment.

If passed, Bill 25, Protecting Alberta Industry from Theft Act, 2020, and associated regulations will require scrap metal dealers to report all transactions involving commonly stolen metals and items such as catalytic converters to law enforcement. Metal theft is a significant risk to individuals, their families, their communities, and the public at large. Thieves terrify property and business owners by trespassing and stealing materials such as copper wire and industrial batteries, and frequently damage and interfere with critical systems like electrical lines, telecommunications networks and transportation infrastructure. Criminals often steal metal from property owners and businesses in isolated areas to avoid detection, making rural Albertans a particular target of thieves and trespassers looking for metal to steal and sell. The government took decisive steps against metal theft in fall 2019 by proclaiming the Scrap Metal Dealers and Recyclers Identification Act, which passed in 2013 but previous governments never brought into force.  “Our government has heard loud and clear from Albertans who have been victimized by property theft for far too long. We are taking action to protect them by making it more difficult for criminals to monetize the goods and materials they steal. This will send a strong message that taking advantage of vulnerable Albertans and their businesses will not be tolerated. We want Albertans to know we are going to do everything we can as a provincial government to help them feel safe.” Doug Schweitzer, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General   “Scrap metal theft is an ongoing challenge across rural Alberta with major impacts on many rural business and industries. Bill 25 is an important step toward protecting rural Albertans from the risks of scrap metal theft by developing a centralized database of scrap metal sales. RMA appreciates the Government of Alberta’s decisive action to address rural crime and support safe rural communities.” Al Kemmere, president, Rural Municipalities of Alberta  Amendments to the act and new regulations define the types of metal subject to reporting rules, specify identification requirements for sellers and record-keeping duties for dealers, as well as raising the penalties for anyone who contravenes the act.   “We welcome these regulations and thank the government for taking strong measures to address the issue of metal theft in our province. The theft of copper wire and other metals from critical infrastructure, including the electricity sector, can be a fatal mistake for thieves and risks the safety of our employees and communities across Alberta.” Scott Yost, senior manager, security and contingency planning, Capital Power  To give stakeholders time to adjust and comply, the new provisions would be implemented in two stages. On Sept. 1, new provisions would include a requirement for sellers to provide government-issued photo ID. Dealers would be required to record and retain the seller’s ID information, as well as details of the transaction. Provisions coming into force on Nov. 1 would include requirements for dealers to report transactions to law enforcement and for all payments to be made using traceable forms of currency, such as electronic transfers or cheques.

The bill proposes amendments to 15 acts across seven ministries. The amendments are being proposed now that the state of public health emergency has ended. The proposed amendments will allow some pandemic response efforts to continue and introduce new measures to support the safe and successful reopening of Alberta’s economy.  “Bill 24 allows us to continue to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic to protect public health and ensure Albertans have access to the services and support they need as Alberta moves forward with reopening our economy.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health  Highlights of the bill include extending existing measures, such as:  Extending to August 2021 the unpaid job-protected leave specific to COVID-19, which allows employees to take leave to care for a child due to school or daycare closures or to care for an ill or self-isolating family member. Providing updated guidance for operating child care programs, including increasing the maximum cohort group size from 10 to 30 staff and children, helping operators reopen safely and ensuring parents have access to child care as they return to work. Allowing for remote signing and witnessing of estate and care documents through two-way video conferencing, ensuring Albertans continue to have access to justice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extending the maximum time for temporary layoffs related to COVID-19 from 120 days to 180 days (this change would come into force upon first reading). Extending arrangements that support the Chief Medical Officer of Health Order No. 10 that allows a health-care facility to limit employees to working at one site. Extending the use of emergency powers for an additional 60 days now that the state of public health emergency has ended, and extending existing ministerial orders to continue to protect the health of Albertans during relaunch. Creating a new regulation-making authority to support and empower orders of the chief medical officer of health, as required. All current public health orders that have been put in place by the chief medical officer of health remain in force.  New measures include:  Providing the province and municipalities with flexibility and authority to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and future provincial emergencies, including to suspend or modify permit requirements for temporary facilities such as drive-thru COVID-19 testing sites. Extending the deadline for the public release of Alberta’s annual report and financial statements to Aug. 31. Ensuring Albertans retain their rights to appeal claims related to private career colleges in the courts or for the Government of Alberta to make claims related to  student financial assistance.  Extending the grace period of expired board member appointments to the Apprenticeship and Industry Training Board from three to five months after the term expires to allow time for a safe recruitment process.

Le projet de loi propose la modification de 15 lois dans sept ministères. Les modifications sont proposées maintenant, puisque l’état d’urgence sanitaire est terminé. Les modifications proposées permettront de déployer des efforts de lutte contre la pandémie afin de poursuivre les mesures d’aide à une relance de l’économie albertaine sécuritaire et fructueuse, et d’en introduire de nouvelles.  « Le projet de loi 24 nous permet de continuer de lutter efficacement contre la pandémie de COVID-19 pour protéger la santé publique et garantir à la population albertaine un accès aux services et à l’aide dont ils ont besoin, alors que le gouvernement de l’Alberta poursuit la relance de son économie. » Tyler Shandro, ministre de la Santé  Les points saillants du projet de loi comprennent la prorogation des mesures existantes, notamment :  Prolonger jusqu’en août 2021 du congé sans solde assorti d’une protection de l’emploi en lien avec la COVID-19, grâce auquel les employés peuvent prendre un congé pour s’occuper d’un enfant en raison de la fermeture des écoles et des garderies, ou pour prendre soin d’un membre de sa famille malade ou en isolement volontaire. Fournir des conseils à jour sur le fonctionnement des programmes de garde d’enfants, notamment l’augmentation de la taille maximale des groupes de cohortes de 10 à 30 personnes (membres du personnel et enfants), aidant ainsi les exploitants à rouvrir en toute sécurité et garantissant aux parents l’accès aux services de garde d’enfants à mesure qu’ils retournent au travail. Permettre la signature et la certification à distance de documents de succession et de gestion par vidéoconférence bidirectionnelle, garantissant aux Albertains et aux Albertaines un accès continu à la justice pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Prolonger le délai maximum des mises à pied temporaires associées à COVID-19 jusqu’à 180 jours au lieu de 120 jours (ce changement entrerait en vigueur en première lecture). Prolonger les dispositions qui appuient l’ordonnance no 10 de la médecin hygiéniste en chef qui permet à un établissement de santé de limiter le nombre d’employés travaillant à un seul emplacement. Prolonger l’utilisation des pouvoirs d’urgence pendant 60 jours supplémentaires, maintenant que l’état d’urgence pour la santé publique a pris fin, et proroger les ordonnances ministérielles existantes pour continuer à protéger la santé de la population albertaine durant la relance. Créer un nouveau pouvoir de réglementation pour appuyer et autoriser les ordonnances de la médecin hygiéniste en chef, au besoin. Toutes les ordonnances de santé publique délivrées par la médecin hygiéniste en chef restent en vigueur.  Les nouvelles mesures comprennent notamment :  Modifier les exigences relatives aux installations de santé temporaires associées à la pandémie, y compris l’autorisation d’exemptions pour les installations temporaires comme les centres de dépistage de la COVID-19 au volant. Proroger la date limite de publication du rapport annuel et des états financiers du gouvernement de l’Alberta jusqu’au 31 août. Veiller à ce que les Albertains et les Albertaines aient toujours le droit d’interjeter appel auprès des tribunaux des réclamations relatives aux collèges privés d’enseignement professionnel ou que le gouvernement de l’Alberta puisse présenter des réclamations concernant l’aide financière aux étudiants. Prolonger la période de grâce des nominations ayant expirées des membres du Apprenticeship and Industry Training Board (conseil de l’apprentissage et de la formation en industrielle) jusqu’à cinq mois au lieu de trois mois après l’expiration du mandat pour qu’un processus de recrutement sécuritaire puisse être suivi.
