The confirmed cases have been reported in the northern and eastern parts of the province. New Brunswick typically averages two to three cases of vibrio parahaemolyticus a year. “New Brunswickers are encouraged to enjoy healthy seafoods such as clams, mussels, and oysters but should be aware that warmer temperatures may increase the risks of bacteria in these foods,” said Russell. “The risk of food poisoning can be minimized by following some simple food safety guidelines such as washing your hands before and after handling these foods; store raw shellfish and seafood at 4 C in the refrigerator or on ice before cooking and refrigerate leftovers promptly.” Vibrio parahaemolyticus are a naturally occurring bacteria in sea water. The bacteria can grow in shellfish such as clams, oysters and mussels when seawater temperatures are warmer such as in summer months. Handling or eating raw or undercooked shellfish can result in illness. Symptoms usually appear within 12 to 24 hours after a person becomes infected. Most people who become ill have diarrhea, but they can also have headache, nausea, vomiting and fever. Symptoms usually last less than a week. The illness is not spread from person to person. More information about food safety is available online. Information from Fisheries and Oceans Canada on open shellfish harvesting areas are available online.   18-09-20"

The purpose of the survey is to gather information on their experiences during their time at university and for the two years following their graduation. Graduates who complete the survey will have an opportunity to enter their name in a random draw to win one grand prize of $1,500 or one of nine prizes of $500 each. “I encourage graduates to share their experiences and opinions,” said Catherine Stewart, CEO of the commission. “Given the COVID-19 pandemic, this can be a challenging time for recent university graduates. Their responses will help us understand their challenges and successes and will inform universities and governments as they develop policies and programs to assist students and graduates.” Graduates will be contacted by email or telephone over the coming weeks. Those who graduated in 2018 but who are not contacted can complete the survey online. The survey collects information on employment; financing education, including debt and repayment experiences; the pursuit of further studies and migration patterns. The commission expects to release a series of reports with the findings beginning in 2021. Stewart said the information will also be of interest to student groups and to the graduates themselves, allowing them to compare their experiences to that of their peers. The survey is being conducted, in both English and French, by PRA Inc. on behalf of the commission. The project is funded by the governments of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island and made possible through the collaboration of the participating Maritime universities. More information about the MPHEC survey program is available online. The Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission was established in 1974 as an arm’s length organization accountable to the ministers responsible for post-secondary education in the Maritimes. It comprises 20 members representing universities, the public-at-large (including students), and the three Maritime provincial governments. The commission’s mandate is to give first consideration to improving and maintaining the best possible service to students as lifelong learners.     16-09-20"

The New Brunswick Human Rights Award will be presented to Claudette Bradshaw, of Moncton, and the Youth Human Rights Award will be presented to Emma Coakley, of Saint John. “For over 30 years, the Human Rights Award has underscored major contributions by New Brunswickers to our province, and this year’s recipients are no exception,” said commission chairperson Claire Roussel-Sullivan. “These individuals are a source of inspiration to all New Brunswickers, and their involvement shows the importance of taking action and being dedicated to the promotion of equality and respect for others.” Bradshaw distinguished herself through her efforts, achievements, and exceptional leadership focused on the importance of helping the victims of discrimination based on social status or family status. “My mission was for children and their families to grow up with dignity and succeed in life without experiencing discrimination,” said Bradshaw. “I want to share that recognition with everyone who supported me throughout those years and who believed, as I did, that we all have the right to a better life.” The Youth Human Rights Award highlights the ability of young people to engage in promoting the values associated with human rights, such as respect, appreciation for diversity and the absence of discrimination. This award is being presented to Coakley for her dedication to making the people of her area aware of the topic of amputation, prostheses, the War Amps, and the PlaySafe program. “I think that my experience as an amputee and my positive attitude help to make the messages even clearer,” Coakley said. “I hope that the knowledge I provide will enhance people’s understanding and open their minds to accepting people with unique differences.” New Brunswick Human Rights Day is observed every Sept. 15 to commemorate the evolution, recognition and protection of human rights in the province. Since 1967, the commission has been responsible for enforcing the Human Rights Act. The organization is also responsible for the act’s evolution by recommending amendments to reflect societal changes. The award, a sculpture of walnut and maple with the names of the recipients engraved on the base, is on permanent public display at Government House. It was established by the commission in 1988 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The awards ceremony will take place this winter.

We live in a province deeply rooted in diversity, and we must be able to count on one another to live in equality. It is also important that our different values and attitudes, actions, behaviours, and comments value respect for others and thus help all New Brunswickers overcome the challenges of the pandemic in their daily lives. Let us respect the rights of people working at home, who must strike a balance between work and family through this new school year, which brings with it some major adjustments for children, parents, and employers. Let us think of those searching for housing that meets their needs, despite the stress created by their precarious employment income. Let us think about people with special needs who must adjust to wearing a mask when the situation arises and who are asked to change their working or consumer habits. Let us seize opportunities to better understand the challenges and obstacles experienced by Indigenous peoples and LGBTQ2S communities in our province. It is important to treat others with dignity, respect and equality. You can contact the Human Rights Commission for information on how to better equip yourself to deal with the concerns of those close to you. Be active and informed. Since 2002, Sept. 15 has been the day that we officially commemorate the recognition of human rights in all communities across the province and underscores the coming into effect of the New Brunswick Human Rights Act on Sept. 15, 1967.

This year, Elections New Brunswick will use the same results reporting process that was used in the 2018 provincial general election. This means that results from the tabulation machines located at polling stations will only be uploaded once all electors, including any that are standing in line waiting to vote when the polls close, have been processed. If there are lineups, electors already waiting are permitted to vote after 8 p.m. after which the poll can be closed. This will delay reporting from that particular polling station. Results from the tabulation machines used for advance voting may be among the first results to be made public on election evening, as returning office staff upload these results shortly after the close of polls at 8 p.m. The last results expected to be available on election night are from the tabulation machines located across the province at each of the 50 returning offices. After the close of polls at 8 p.m., the returning office staff must first process all mail-in ballots that arrived that day, as well as any out-of-office special ballots collected by curbside voting that day. An electoral district’s results cannot be declared final until all of that district’s advance and ordinary tabulation machines have reported, and all 50 returning office tabulation machines have transmitted their respective results. It is anticipated that the final results will not be published until after midnight, and there may be lengthy delays between the results reported from small polling stations and those reported from larger polling stations where line ups may be present at the close of polls. Elections New Brunswick’s mandate and first priority on election night is to ensure the accuracy of the results reporting process, which is particularly important with the high usage of mail-in ballots in this election due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   08-09-20"

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the department has collaborated with Public Health, WorkSafeNB and partners across the education system to develop plans to mitigate health and safety risks to students and staff. Each of the 294 schools in the system has developed individual operational plans taking into consideration their student population and facilities, and in keeping with the specific needs of their community. The Return to School plan and guides are living documents intended to inform the public on the return to school in September 2020. As new discoveries, research or information becomes available, the directives of government may change and the documents will be updated to reflect these changes. Learning Full-time learning will continue to be mandatory for all students, whether they are in class or at home. High school students are reminded that virtual attendance will be taken, and they will be expected to collaborate or participate in class virtually when they are learning from home. Individual plans will be developed for vulnerable students on a case-by-case basis. Reminders for first day of school Students need to bring two clean face masks to school with them every day and a plastic bag or container to store them in throughout the day when they are not in use.

These groupings will also help facilitate contact tracing, if required. Within their classroom groupings, students will be able to interact with other students and educators without physical distancing. This means they will be able to play, do crafts and group work throughout the day. While they will be able to share supplies or materials in the classroom, it is highly recommended that students have their own supplies. If supplies are shared they should be cleaned at the end of the day. Students will need to physical distance from other groups and from students outside their classroom grouping by two metres. Equipment that is used by multiple groupings, such as physical education equipment or computers, will be cleaned after each use. The size of the grouping will vary based upon the grade level. For students in kindergarten to Grade 2, the group size will be reduced to as close to 15 as possible. Grades 3 to 5 will aim for groupings close to 22 students, while Grades 6 to 8 will be regular class sizes. All students and staff in the kindergarten to Grade 8 system will be required to bring two clean, community face masks to school with them every day unless they have been advised by a medical professional not to wear a mask. Students in kindergarten to Grade 5 will not be required to wear masks in their classroom grouping but will be encouraged to wear them in common areas, like hallways. Students in Grades 6 through 8 will not need to wear a mask while in their classroom grouping, but they will be required to wear one in common areas, including on the school bus unless they are seated with a member of their household. For staff in the kindergarten to Grade 8 system, masks are not required within their classroom grouping, but are required in common areas. Specialty teachers, like gym and music teachers, and supply staff are required to wear masks when working with students if physical distancing is not possible. Music education Students of all ages will be able to sing and use instruments throughout the year. Wind instruments and singing will be allowed, however, additional health and safety measures will also be required, including physical distancing, increased cleaning and disinfection. These activities should take place in outdoor spaces as much as possible. When weather prevents outdoor classes, proper hand sanitization is required prior to entering the space where music is taught and upon leaving. Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 will participate in music class within their class groupings. Physical distancing within their class grouping is not required, and musical instruments may be shared within the grouping. They will be able to sing indoors when weather prevents this activity from taking place outside. Students will be encouraged to sing softly and to increase their physical distance when singing indoors. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will maintain a physical distance of two metres while participating in music class or other music-related activities.

This approach is intended to promote flexibility for students as they rotate between learning in school and learning from home. The Laptop Subsidy Program is available to students from low- and middle-income families who require a laptop through the Parent Portal. Eligible families who have yet to purchase a laptop have two options:  They may purchase their own laptop and be reimbursed, provided the laptop meets the technical specifications.   They may choose to purchase a laptop through the department’s provider at a reduced rate, after taking into account the amount of subsidy for which their family is eligible. For this option, families will need to register for a special code through the Parent Portal.  Families which are not eligible for a subsidy are also able to receive the department’s special rate by purchasing a device through the program. More information on the program is available by calling 1-833-901-1963 or by emailing EECDRTS-EDPERAE@gnb.ca. To increase access to virtual learning for students, particularly those in rural communities, alternate learning spaces will be made available, either in a school or in other community facilities. More information will be available through the schools in the coming weeks.

The use of outdoor spaces will be encouraged. Students will be permitted to use the gymnasium or other spaces within their school, provided they wash or sanitize their hands upon entering and leaving the space. Face masks will not be required during physical education classes or while students are engaged in play during a sporting event. Students in kindergarten through Grade 8 will participate in physical education within their class grouping, or bubble. As in the classroom, these groupings will not have to physically distance during physical education classes, but age-appropriate practices, such as proper hygiene etiquette and reduced physical contact, will be encouraged. Sporting equipment may be shared within the class grouping. Class groupings will maintain a two-metre distance from other groupings, including any teachers or coaches that are not part of their regular class grouping. If two groups are using the gym at the same time, a divider or curtain may be used to keep them separated. High school students will keep at least one-metre physical distance throughout physical education, as they would in their other classes. The use of markings, such as floor tape, hula hoops, or cones and general signage, is recommended to indicate where students can sit, stand, or participate according to physical distancing guidelines. Equipment will be disinfected after each use. If this is not possible, the equipment will not be used. Intramural activities and extracurricular clubs Intramural sporting activities will be permitted, within kindergarten to Grade 8 classroom groupings or for high-school students who are physically distancing, following the same guidelines for physical education, provided that the province or health zone remains in the yellow phase. If a zone moves to orange or red, then all intramural activities will be suspended. In the event of an outbreak in a school, regional Public Health officials will provide direction to the school regarding intramural activities. Students participating in school clubs will also be required to follow physical distancing guidelines. Whenever possible, it is recommended meetings take place virtually, for example student governance meetings or chess clubs. Guidelines for music education and music-related extracurricular activities, including band and choir, will be shared in the coming weeks. Change rooms will be cleaned a minimum of three times a day. Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 must stay within their class groupings while using the changing room. Students in Grades 9 to12 must maintain a physical distance of one metre while using the changing room. Interscholastic sports and events Over the 2020-21 school year, interscholastic and other extra-curricular activities will also be able to take place, provided the province or zone stays in the yellow phase. All interscholastic or extra-curricular activities or events will require an operational plan, based upon direction from Public Health officials. Competitive sporting events for all students should be limited to subdivisions of a school district or to a small region to allow play while limiting contact across regions. Carpooling will be discouraged, and participants should arrive ready for the event, including with any necessary equipment. Team rosters should be held to a reasonable number, including coaches, and attendance will be taken at each practice or game. Lists of all participants, including coaches, players and volunteers will be kept for any events. A maximum of 50 spectators will be allowed in outdoor settings, and spectators must practise physical distancing. No spectators will be permitted for events held inside the school, although virtual options are encouraged if possible. Participants will not engage in any unnecessary physical contact, such as high-fives or handshakes. While verbal recognition of awards may take place, trophies or ribbons will be delivered at a later date. In cases where an organized sport has a provincial governing body, the level of play and associated modified rules will comply with the operational plans developed by that body. If there is no governing body, the sport must have a provincewide operational plan that complies with the directions of the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. The department will collaborate with school districts in the development of the provincial operational plans.

Families of students with significant medical conditions are asked to consult with their health-care provider to determine whether it is safe for them to attend school. If they are advised that the student should not attend school, families are encouraged to contact the school principal beginning Aug. 31 to discuss plans to ensure they can continue learning at home. Districts and schools will work with the families of medically vulnerable students to develop a plan to ensure that they have consistent access to education, based upon their needs and situation. Students currently on personalized learning plans will continue to follow their plans. All students in kindergarten through Grade 8 who are not medically vulnerable will attend school full time. Many high school students will be attending classes every other day, however, high school students with complex needs will attend full time to ensure consistent access to the services and support they require. Educational Support Services teams will contact identified families between Aug. 31 and Sept. 4 to work with them in the development of their child’s personalized learning plan. Any students who have previously been provided assistive technology will continue to have access to that technology. This applies to students in all grades. Schools and school districts have been reminded that students who were not considered vulnerable or at risk prior to the pandemic may now be experiencing difficulties that affect their well-being, mental health and learning abilities. Individual support plans will be developed for these students as well. Any student whose family has decided not to send them to school for any reason or because of the pandemic will be required to complete the annual home-school request form. COVID-19 testing for teachers and school staff Public Health will make COVID-19 testing available for asymptomatic teachers or school staff who are concerned about potential exposure to the virus. “Providing regular testing for asymptomatic teachers and school staff will help to better identify and isolate cases in schools,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health.” Transportation Unless a student is staying home for medical reasons, vulnerable students travelling on a school bus will follow the same directives previously shared by the department. All students will sit in the same seat on their school bus every day. To promote physical distancing, buses will be filled from back to front. Clear curtains are also being installed to provide a physical barrier between bus drivers and students while students are getting on and off the bus. Since K-5 students are not required to wear masks, they will sit one student per seat, or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6 to 12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, but do not have to wear masks if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household.

20,2020-08-20,Canada,New Brunswick,,https://www2.gnb.ca//content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2020.08.0456.html,Government Website,Salmonella outbreak in New Brunswick,"FREDERICTON (GNB) -- A salmonella outbreak has been declared in the province following 13 confirmed cases between June 16 and July 27, and two more potential cases under investigation. The Department of Health is monitoring the situation and is in contact with the Public Health Agency of Canada. A specific cause of the outbreak has not been identified; however, salmonella enteritidis is commonly associated with the consumption and handling of raw chicken and eggs. The increase in cases is in the province’s northern and eastern regions. “When preparing raw meats, the risk is especially high for certain kinds of food poisoning, including infection caused by the bacteria salmonella enteritidis,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “I strongly encourage people to take safety precautions when handling raw chicken and eggs and to ensure that these and all raw meat products are thoroughly cooked.” Symptoms of salmonellosis usually appear within one or two days after a person becomes infected. Most people who become ill experience diarrhea, stomach cramps, headache, nausea, vomiting and fever. Symptoms usually last less than a week. In some people, serious illness can develop. Most cases are associated with improperly handling or eating raw and undercooked eggs or poultry. Salmonella infection can also be spread by contact between cooked foods and raw poultry on unwashed cutting boards or knives. Salmonella bacteria are also passed in the feces of infected people and animals, and can be found in contaminated soil, food, water or on surfaces. The bacteria are spread by person to person contact, by animal to person contact, by eating contaminated food or by drinking contaminated water. New Brunswickers are urged to reduce the risk of food poisoning by following a few common-sense precautions, including using proper food safety procedures when handling raw poultry and eggs, cooking these foods thoroughly and cleaning up properly. Cook: Kill harmful bacteria by cooking food until it reaches the proper temperature. Do not guess. Use a digital instant-read food thermometer to check when meat and poultry are safe to eat. The safe temperatures for cooked foods are:  85° C (185° F) for whole poultry;   71° C (160° F) for ground beef; and   74° C (165° F) for leftover food.  Eggs are safer when cooked thoroughly, such as when hard boiled or scrambled, and served hot. If you check the temperature of meat more than once, clean the thermometer before using it again. Eat cooked food while it is still hot. Bacteria can grow when food is allowed to cool down. Keep cold food cold. Letting food sit at unsafe temperatures puts you at risk of food-borne illnesses. Clean Wash hands and surfaces often to avoid the spread of bacteria. Wash your hands with hot, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before handling food, and after handling raw meats, eggs or poultry, using the bathroom, changing diapers, or touching pets. All harmful bacteria can be spread just by touching an infected surface, such as a cutting board, and then touching another surface. Wash and sanitize all plates, utensils and cutting boards that touched or held raw meat or poultry before using them again for cooked foods. Use a mild bleach and water solution before and after preparing food to sanitize surfaces. Keep raw foods separate from cooked foods to avoid cross-contamination. Store raw meats and poultry in the fridge on bottom shelves to prevent juices from dripping onto other foods. The simple rule is: when in doubt, throw it out. More information about food safety is available online.   20-08-20"

Exports are critical to the provincial economy, and the province is more than self-sufficient in export products such as seafood, blueberries, maple, cranberries and potatoes. The government intends to focus on opportunities to increase self-sufficiency in other products. Already this year the Department of Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries has supported a number of projects such as extending the growing season with support for greenhouses, increasing on-farm storage capacity and supporting food and beverage businesses to build connections with clients. In the coming months, areas of focus include education, training, labour, market access and value-added opportunities. The department will work with several other government departments along with the food-producing sectors. “I look forward to working with our vital agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries industries as we move forward,” said Wetmore. “We have a thriving food-producing sector in the province, and I would like to see it grow and feed more New Brunswickers.”   17-08-20"

Work will continue with the districts to ensure that the needs of students across the province are met.” The Quadruple Bottom Line Multi-Criteria analysis process provides an unbiased, data-driven analysis which is used annually to evaluate major capital school infrastructure projects that have been requested by the school districts. These projects are over $1 million and include renovations to existing schools as well as new construction projects. Every year, school districts evaluate their regional needs based on factors such as demographics and age or condition of existing infrastructure and submit a list of major capital project requests to the department. The department uses the tool to assess and prioritize all submissions in order to create a provincial priority list of capital projects based on a high to low ranking. The evaluation process for all projects is undertaken by the same team of knowledgeable staff to ensure a consistent analysis of all projects. The tool was initially developed in 2014 with the assistance of school districts and experts at Ernst & Young. It includes 15 indicators divided into four quadrants: economy, environment, social, and cultural. In 2018, a tiering process which allows schools with significant space deficiencies to be prioritized was also developed and implemented. 14-08-20"

The 2008 flood map has also been updated to more accurately reflect historical flooding, also in the lower basin. The 2018 map was completed by dividing the entire Saint John River into 83 sections and applying maximum water levels to each of those sections. Data from water level gauges stationed along the river as well as the Hydrology Centre’s hydraulic model currently used for flood forecasting were analyzed. In addition, a survey team was sent out in 2019 to verify peak flood levels and confirm the accuracy of the Hydrology Centre’s modeling. Aerial imagery of the 2018 flood was also used to validate the extent of flooding. “We are committed to providing timely and accurate information so that people and organizations can plan and prepare for future floods, protecting their health and safety,” said Environment and Local Government Minister Jeff Carr. “The more accurate and update-to-date information we have, the better positioned we are to make informed decisions quickly.” A similar methodology was used to update the 2008 map, focusing on the area from Mactaquac to the Bay of Fundy, where flooding was the worst. Although the province experienced significant flooding in 2019, it was not to the same extent as in 2018 so a map for last year was not completed. The new maps do not account for future potential flooding resulting from climate change and they do not reflect the risk associated with one-in-20-year flooding or one-in-100-year flooding frequencies. Flood hazard maps are being developed under the Climate Change Action Plan and work on this initiative is ongoing. Both maps are available at GeoNB.   14-08-20"

Established in 1968, collectionArtNB is a permanent collection now totalling 962 works of art, serving as a record of excellence in the province's visual arts. Every two years, a jury selects artwork by contemporary artists to be purchased. The calls for acquisitions, this year, specifically focused on the Aboriginal artistic community to increase their representation in the collection. “CollectionArtNB should be an open window on the cultural fabric that shapes our everyday lives and be representative of all cultural aspects of our province,” said Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Bruce Fitch. “We are very fortunate to have such a wide range of talented artists in our province and after more than 50 years, collectionArtNB has became a truly remarkable collection, containing extraordinary works by many revered artists.” The list of new Aboriginal acquisitions includes:  Katie Augustine: Pskihqiminsok (Strawberries) (2019) / Strawberry Basket (Medium) (2019) Tara Francis: Grandmother Moon Turtle (2019) / Grandmother Moon Turtle Legend (2019) / Monarch (2020) Belinda Levi: Working Hands (2017) Marie Fox: Momentum (2017)  “These works will be an extraordinary addition to the province’s art collection,” said Aboriginal Affairs Minister Jake Stewart. “Having a call for acquisition specifically dedicated to Aboriginal artists ensures that we reflect our cultural richness through an increase of Aboriginal pieces in the art bank. This values the traditions, cultures and identity of the First Nations and these additional pieces will promote an increased understanding and appreciation of their contribution to New Brunswick.” Last winter, professional artists working in New Brunswick for more than one year were invited to submit artwork for acquisition. Artists from all communities, anglophone, francophone and Aboriginal, were encouraged to participate. Among the other new acquisitions are:  Judy Blake: Saggar-fired vessel (2019) Yalda Borzorg: Week 05 – Exuberance – Quiet (2018) Marika Drolet-Ferguson: Entre, 01 (2017-2019) Annie France Noël: Aux Femmes I et II (2017) Emilie Grace Lavoie: In Medicamentum (2015) Ann Manuel: Forecast (2017) Emily Phillips: Coppermine Trail (2018) Collin Smith: Literacy (2020) Barbara Safran de Niverville: Caribou Lichen (2019) Matt Watkins: Receptacle for Preserving Fragments (2017)  The mandate of collectionArtNB is to support and feature New Brunswick artists.

It works in conjunction with Public Health guidance to the department and may be changed based upon the evolution of the pandemic. “While we released our high-level Return to School plan in June, we know students, families and educators still had many questions on what to expect when they go back into the classroom,” said Education and Early Childhood Development Minister Dominic Cardy. “A critical part of reopening schools while we live through this pandemic is protecting the health and safety of staff and students; however, our mandate continues to be ensuring that students have access to quality, inclusive education that positions them for long-term success.” In addition to reduced group sizes, classroom bubbles for students in kindergarten to Grade 8 and blended learning for high school students, the guide includes direction for face mask use, transportation, cleaning, outbreak management and learning plans. “Public Health was pleased to collaborate with the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development in establishing this comprehensive approach to returning to school safely,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “We will continue to provide guidance throughout the school year on various issues ranging from prevention measures to managing an outbreak and will support our students, families, educators and school staff every step of the way.” Face mask use Every student will bring a face mask to school daily, but masks will not be required inside the classroom. Students in Grades 6-12 will wear face masks on the school bus and in common areas of the school such as washrooms and in the hallways. Use of a face mask in common areas is encouraged for students in K-5 but is not required. If they stay within their classroom bubble, K-8 teachers can choose whether or not to wear a face mask or shield. In Grades 9-12, teachers will wear a face mask or shield whenever they are not able to physically distance. Transportation Curtains will be installed to provide a physical barrier between school bus drivers and students while students get on and off the bus. If physical distancing is not possible, the driver will be required to wear a face mask or shield. Students will sit in the same seat every day. To promote physical distancing, buses will be filled from back to front. As K-5 students are not required to wear masks, they will sit one student per seat, or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6-12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, but do not have to wear masks if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household. Personal safety and screening Parents will be responsible for screening their child before coming to school daily. Information packages, including screening questionnaires will be sent directly to families through the schools. Information is also available online. Educators will teach students age-appropriate ways to reduce physical contact and promote good hygiene. Students will be reminded to wash or sanitize their hands regularly, including each time they enter the school or classroom. Enhanced cleaning protocols Hand sanitizing stations will be installed at school entrances and in every classroom. Drinking fountains will be replaced with water bottle filling stations. Commonly touched surfaces will be cleaned regularly throughout the day. Personal spaces, such as desks and lockers, will be cleaned daily. Changing rooms will be cleaned a minimum of three times per day. More details on specific school cleaning protocols will be outlined in each school’s individual operational plan. “Everyone has a role to play in supporting a safe return to school,” said Cardy. “To achieve this goal, we will need the cooperation of parents, students and educators to model healthy and positive behaviours, build trust and be respectful with one another.” The department will continue to work with educators, schools and school districts in the coming months. Schools and districts will make individual school operational plans available to parents before students return to school on Sept. 8.

This is a great example of how we are energizing the private sector and helping to support vibrant and sustainable communities.” The Indigenous Agriculture Development Program is open to all First Nation communities, individuals or organizations interested in farming and agricultural development in the province. “This program is an important step towards engaging Indigenous New Brunswickers in the agri-food sector,” said Aboriginal Affairs Minister Jake Stewart. “With this kind of support in place, First Nations communities will have new opportunities to participate in farming operations, manage production and contribute to our economy.” Applications are already being accepted. Guidelines and application forms are available online. “This joint collaboration between the federal and provincial governments will provide an opportunity to share agricultural knowledge and enhance the viability and profitability of the agricultural sector,” said federal Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller. “The Canadian Agricultural Partnership will provide Indigenous people in New Brunswick with additional resources that support their involvement in agriculture, which will positively contribute to economic development in the province.” Successful applicants will receive support to develop viable business plans and manage finances and production costs. Funding is also available for Indigenous organizations that wish to assess their competitiveness, and for any training required for their farming operations. “There are tremendous economic opportunities in the agricultural industry, and with this program, our government is helping Indigenous entrepreneurs take advantage of those opportunities,” said federal Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau. “Beyond creating jobs and boosting local economies, their work will build long-term resiliency in our food systems and keep high-quality locally produced food on our kitchen tables.” Applicants are encouraged to apply to all the Canadian Agriculture Partnership programs for funding. Signed in 2018, the national partnership is a five-year, $3-billion investment by federal, provincial and territorial governments that aims to strengthen the agriculture and agri-food sector across the country and to ensure continued innovation, growth and prosperity. Funding is dedicated towards simplified programs and services that are easy to access, as well as enhancements to help producers manage their farm. The new program intended for First Nations draws its funding from the partnership’s existing budget. “This new Indigenous-specific program is a step in the right direction towards creating more opportunities for First Nations in the agriculture sector,” said Chief Ross Perley of the Tobique First Nation. “We are happy to see this progress, but we still have a long way to go. We are looking forward to working together to advance Indigenous involvement in the agriculture sector and improve on our food security.” 13-08-20"

The province’s justice system has been preparing for jury selection for the fitness hearing of Matthew Raymond, which is scheduled to begin on Aug. 17. “Being the first jurisdiction in Canada to hold a complete jury trial during the ongoing pandemic is something to be proud of,” said Justice Minister and Attorney General Andrea Anderson-Mason. “When court operations were scaled back it was understood that alternative ways would need to be found to continue to administer justice in a timely manner. With the help of the judiciary, a streamlined process has been developed to ensure the resumption of in-person trials during these extraordinary times.” Holding a jury trial during the pandemic poses significant challenges due to the high volume of individuals required to conduct the jury selection process, and because jurors must maintain physical distance throughout the duration of the trial. Several steps have been taken by the Department of Justice and Office of the Attorney General to ensure the hearing can be done safely, including:  acquiring larger spaces and creating temporary courtrooms to allow for physical distancing; implementing pre-trial screening for jurors to limit the number of people that must physically attend jury selection; assigning a barcode to jury candidates so they can register through a computer program to reduce the amount of time spent on site during the selection process; and implementing health screening and contact tracing.  “Jury duty is an important pillar of the justice system and is a segment of the law which protects our fundamental rights,” said Anderson-Mason. “All reasonable precautions have been made to adjust to our current realities and make it safe for people to play their part in ensuring the fair, efficient administration of justice.” Not everyone who is called for jury duty will be selected to serve as a juror, but under normal circumstances those who are summonsed must be present for the selection process. Those who fail to appear can be held in contempt of court and may face a fine of up to $1,000, or any other penalty that a judge may impose in contempt proceedings. 13-08-20"

Launched by the Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture, the Fresh AIR Program is intended to provide artists with a location separate from a regular studio or workplace, where they can produce work while engaging with the public. “Offering artist residencies, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, will help raise the profile of arts and culture in our province,” said Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Bruce Fitch. “Because of COVID-19, artists of all disciplines in New Brunswick have been facing challenges in showcasing and selling their work. This new initiative will be a great opportunity for our professional artists to get valuable exposure and provide New Brunswickers with an opportunity to learn more about the artistic work being done in our province.” The artist-in-residence initiative will take place from Sept. 5-7 at the following provincial parks and tourism sites:  Hopewell Rocks New Brunswick Botanical Garden / République Provincial Park Mount Carleton Mactaquac Village Historique Acadien  Eligible artistic disciplines include architecture, craft, dance, literary arts (including spoken word, storytelling, literary performance and literary translation), media arts, multidisciplinary arts, classical and non-classical music, theatre and visual arts. Selected artists will receive $500 per day for up to three days. More information for professional artists interested in participating in the program is available online.

We have looked to the science, spoken with Public Health, and together have determined what situations would trigger different levels of response.” To reduce the impact of another possible wave of COVID-19, Public Health has reviewed all alert levels and associated measures in light of new scientific knowledge and of the effectiveness of previous control measures in Canada and other countries. Details associated with these levels are available online. “New Brunswick is in a much different position to respond to COVID-19 than it was when the pandemic began,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “Everyone must take precautions to limit the spread of the virus and keep the province in the Yellow level of recovery by protecting ourselves and others.” Yellow Alert Level: This level applies today as the virus is considered controlled but there remains a risk of community transmission. Physical distancing and standard public health measures will continue to be required to mitigate the risk associated with sporadic cases or clusters. Revised measures under Yellow include allowing public venues with seating to reduce physical distancing down to one metre with the continuous use of a mask. This measure already exists when using public transit and will apply starting Monday, Aug. 17 in settings such as theatres or recreational facilities such as arenas with the condition that food and drink not be consumed when people are seated at this distance. Distancing of two metres would be required in order for food or drinks to be consumed. Orange Alert Level: This level would apply when there is a significant risk that COVID-19 is no longer under control. Restrictions on non-essential contact activities, both socially and in some workplaces, would be required to address a high risk of community transmission. Revised measures under Orange would include allowing public venues with seating to reduce physical distancing down to one metre with the continuous use of a mask. Other measures would include allowing unregulated health professionals to operate. However, close contact personal services such as barbers, hair stylists or spas would remain closed. The two-household bubble would remain, but households would now be able to add formal or informal caregivers as well as members of their immediate family (parents, children, siblings and grandparents). Red Alert Level: This level would apply when COVID-19 is no longer under control. Strong restrictions to limit unnecessary movement of people and contacts to contain community transmission would be necessary. Revised measures under Red would allow a much broader range of businesses to continue to operate as long as they have appropriate public health measures in place. Residents would need to return to a single-household bubble but they would now keep the ability to add formal or informal caregivers and members of immediate family (parents, children, siblings and grandparents) that were introduced in the previous levels. Daycares would remain open under appropriate guidance while kindergarten to Grade 12 schools would be limited to virtual instruction only. Teachers and school employees would continue to work at schools to teach virtually from their classroom. All primary care providers and regulated health professionals would be able to continue to offer their services utilizing virtual means whenever possible. Green Alert Level: This would represent the end of the pandemic. All directives specific to COVID-19 would be lifted. “It is imperative that we resume our lives, get back to school and work, support local businesses, and strengthen our economy,” said Higgs. “But it is equally imperative that we do all of this mindfully, remembering to take the simple but necessary steps to keep all of us healthy and safe, while keeping our province in the Yellow level. By following Public Health advice and obeying the mandatory order, we can keep our economy open and avoid a return to restrictive rules.” Transparent public health triggers have now been developed which, if met, would lead to a comprehensive risk assessment and recommendations to government to move either a region, or the province, through different alert levels. Details related to these triggers are available online. “We are better prepared to live with COVID-19 in our midst, even if the dangers the virus presents remain the same until a vaccine is developed,” said Russell. “As a result, the Public Health response in a second wave will focus on keeping society and the economy moving, while keeping people as safe as possible from the disease.” One new case Public Health reported one new case of COVID-19 today. The new case is an individual between 40 and 49, in Zone 3 (Fredericton region), who is self-isolating. The case is currently under investigation. The number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick is 177 and 168 have recovered. There have been two deaths, and there are seven active cases. As of today, 55,379 tests have been conducted. 11-08-20"

The funding is being provided through the Rural and Northern Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure program. “Despite the pandemic, our vision for a better economic future has not changed, which is why the provincial government is pleased to participate in this important project,” said Justice Minister and Attorney General Andrea Anderson-Mason, who is also minister responsible for the Regional Development Corporation. “By investing in projects like this wastewater treatment plant, we help build vibrant communities and contribute to the local economy.” The project will include the construction of new wastewater facilities for screening and grit removal with blowers, UV disinfection, and a moving bed biofilm reactor as well as the construction of new pumped outfall, pumping stations, three lagoon cells, and 2,500 metres of wastewater pipes. Once complete, the upgraded plant will increase the capacity to treat and manage wastewater. “Rural communities are an integral part of our country, and they have been highly impacted by COVID-19 in many different ways,” said Dominic LeBlanc, president of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada. “This is why support to local infrastructure like investing in wastewater treatment plant upgrades in Boudreau-Ouest is essential to building healthy and resilient communities and to protecting the environment. When our small communities thrive, the whole country gets stronger.” LeBlanc spoke on behalf of Maryam Monsef, minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development. The federal government is providing $16.1 million to the project, the provincial government is investing $10.7 million and the Greater Shediac Sewerage Commission is contributing $5.3 million. “On behalf of the Greater Shediac Sewerage Commission Board I extend our appreciation to the Government of Canada and the Government of New Brunswick for their support of this environmental stewardship advancement,” said H.J.

The announcement follows a recent agreement among municipalities to support a new regional model of economic development. “The spirit of co-operation shown by municipalities in Greater Saint John serves as a fine example for other regions of the province,” said Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour Minister Trevor Holder. “These communities are looking beyond their municipal boundaries and working together for the greater good. Our government is pleased to recognize this collaborative and historic effort through a multi-year commitment to employment and population growth initiatives.” The funding will go to a new regional economic development agency to procure labour market and population growth programming and services, thereby benefitting businesses and residents. “Having the provincial government as a financial partner sets the example of what can be achieved by working together as a region and demonstrates the commitment of the government in support of economic development efforts building on the past with a vision of the future. Economic Development Greater Saint John, with its focus on workforce development, is pleased to partner with the province to bring this funding to the new agency,” said Ron Gaudet, CEO of Economic Development Greater Saint John. The proposed model would involve the transition of Discover Saint John, Develop Saint John, Economic Development Greater Saint John and the City of Saint John’s Population Growth service into one regional agency. The agency would work to support a common vision of growth for the region, including the communities of Saint John, Grand Bay-Westfield, Rothesay, Quispamsis, St. Martins and Hampton. The initial funding contract is for five years, beginning in 2021-22; if all municipalities remain in agreement, the contract will be renewed for another five years.

The provincial government typically announces the annual recipients on New Brunswick Day. “With New Brunswick Day fast approaching our residents may be expecting to hear an announcement of this year’s recipients of the Order of New Brunswick,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 our selection process has been delayed, but we still intend to recognize individuals deserving of this honour before the end of the year.” Nominations for the order closed on April 15. Under normal circumstances, the order’s advisory council meets in the spring to review the nominations. A meeting was unable to take place due to restrictions related to COVID-19. The meeting will now be held in the fall followed by the announcement of this year’s recipients in late October or November. The Order of New Brunswick is the highest honour awarded by the province. Established in 2000, it honours and celebrates the achievements of New Brunswickers who have contributed to the economic, cultural and social development of the province.

It was important for the provincial government to find a creative way to celebrate our people and honour our history and cultures.” The event will focus upon the province’s vibrancy and diversity via performances from New Brunswick artists and musicians. There will be performances from iconic sites around the province as well as archival footage from previous Area 506 festivals. “We have always been focused on bringing to the fore the music, culture and goods that make New Brunswick such an amazing place to live, work, and create,” said Ray Gracewood, Area 506 chair. “This year, we obviously had to change our plans due to COVID-19, but we still wanted to find a way to celebrate and show our New Brunswick pride. This event is a great way to support our amazing artists in the province at a time when live shows are few and far between. It is a way to be together, yet apart – at home or at a cottage with friends and family. We are so pleased to partner with the province to be able to present this show.” The New Brunswick Day online show can be viewed Monday, Aug. 3, from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m. on the Area 506 You Tube, Facebook and at AREA506.ca.

The infrastructure investment will support the need for increased connectivity and digital collaboration. This includes increased access points in schools and upgrades to school firewalls and bandwidth. These investments support the Return to School plan. The model allows students to use the devices they already own while modernizing the way in which they learn and interact. It also allows teachers the freedom to use technology to innovate and enhance student learning. A subsidy program will be available for students from low- and middle-income families who do not currently own a device. Families will be provided with up to $600 per high school student to purchase a laptop through the program, depending on their eligibility. Eligibility:  Households with an annual income of up to $40,000 will receive a voucher of $600 per student.   Households with an annual income between $40,000 and $55,000 will receive a maximum voucher amount of $400 for their first student and $600 for each additional student.   Households with an annual income between $55,000 and $70,000 will receive a maximum voucher amount of $200 for the first student, $400 for the second student and $600 for each additional student.   Households with an annual income between $70,000 and $85,000 will receive a maximum voucher amount of $200 for the second student, $400 for the third student and $600 for each additional student.  Eligible families will be able to apply through the Parent Portal online as of July 31. More details on this program will be communicated directly to families. Enquiries may be made by calling 1-833-901-1963. “Our goal is to position every student for success by preparing them for long-term success in their education and in the workplace while also ensuring more equitable and consistent access to technology,” said Cardy. Online teaching platforms have been identified to support learning for high school students and will accompany everyday instruction. Microsoft Teams will be the main platform used in the classroom, which students and teachers can access through their Office 365 account. Some teachers may also opt to use Desire 2 Learn, also known as Brightspace, in the anglophone sector or Clic in the francophone sector. System requirements for these platforms are available online and families are encouraged to review these documents to confirm compatibility with their student’s device. “Providing students with options for a more personalized learning experience that meets their needs strengthens an important element of building a world-class education system,” said Cardy. Providing equitable access to information and communication technology is included in the 10-year Education Plan: Everyone at their best. Supporting ‘bring your own device’ policies, establishing provincial rules for the acquisition and use of technology and addressing technological inequity are action items outlined in the Succeeding at Home: A green paper on education in New Brunswick, which supports the 10-year education plans.   22-07-20"

Motorcycle schools can start offering the written test beginning July 18. Tests will still be offered at Service New Brunswick centres, and there are plans to provide online options for driving written tests in the future. The regular $25 test fee will still apply when taking a test at either a service centre or at a school. “As a motorcycle rider myself, I understand the frustration that people are feeling at not being able to get out on their motorcycles after they have taken the safety course,” said Wilson. “It is a short riding season, so this is a good solution for now.” There are nine licensed motorcycle training schools throughout the province. Participants are advised to check with schools directly to confirm whether the test is offered at their location. Participants who have already completed the safety course can still take the written test if their school is offering it. Safety course participants who do not already have a Class 5 driver’s licence must book the written motorcycle test through a Service New Brunswick office. New Brunswick introduced a graduated driver’s licence program for motorcyclists in 2015. The program is 12 months in duration, and includes the following criteria:  The minimum age of entry is 16 (applicants under 18 years of age must have consent that is witnessed by a non-relative). Participants must successfully pass an approved motorcycle driver training course. Participants will be required to pass a vision screening and their written, basic and sign tests. There is zero tolerance for alcohol or drug use for the duration of the graduated driver’s licence program regardless of age. Participants cannot drive from sunset to sunrise. Participants will not be permitted to tow a vehicle as defined in the Motor Vehicle Act (such as a trailer). Participants cannot have any passengers on their motorcycle for the duration of the graduated driver’s licence program. Participants must have their motorcycle graduated driver’s licence for 12 months without interruption. Participants must successfully pass an on-road test before becoming fully licensed.    17-07-20"

The campaign could be extended to ensure any newly identified risk areas are covered. There is no effective vaccine available for rabies prevention and control in bats. “Distributing oral vaccinations to vulnerable wildlife populations remains a highly effective way to prevent rabies from reaching domestic animals or humans,” said Wetmore. Oral rabies vaccine baits were distributed on Woodstock First Nation lands each year from 2016 through 2019 and will take place again this summer. In addition to hand distribution, an aircraft will be used to distribute bait in the southwestern part of the province Aug. 10-16. A first case of raccoon-variant rabies was reported in the province on July 4. Only one case of raccoon-variant rabies was reported in 2019, the first case to be identified in the province since July of 2017. Rabies continues to occur close to the border with Maine. The vaccine poses little risk to humans or domestic animals. People are urged to take steps to protect themselves, their families, their pets and any livestock from rabies by keeping a safe distance from wildlife, refraining from relocating wildlife, ensuring the vaccinations of pets are up to date, and seeking medical attention promptly if they have been bitten or scratched by an animal that could potentially be rabid. The public is urged to report animals with rabies-like clinical signs to Tele-Care 811. More information on rabies, including a surveillance map of confirmed cases, is available online. 17-07-20"

The funding will go to the Tourism Industry Association of New Brunswick, which proposed the idea and will oversee development of the videos. “We are extremely happy to be part of this great training offer for our restaurants across the province,” said Carol Alderdice, president and CEO of the association. “Restaurant owners need all the help they can get with the cost of doing business and having this training available for free will be one less thing to worry about.” The videos, to be produced separately in English and French, will give employees an overview of everyday tasks in their new positions but are not intended to replace specialized training or certification that may be required for roles such as bartending. ""We are thrilled to have this opportunity to develop introductory training for the restaurant industry here in New Brunswick,” said Peter Stoddart, a board member of Restaurants Canada and owner of Saint John Ale House. “Reducing the cost of onboarding new team members with assets like these will truly help businesses like ours be more resilient over time, and that is more important than ever these days.

The action plan identifies a number of priority areas of concern for persons with a disability. It builds on the progress made since the last disability action plan strategy that was released in 2012. The last status update report from this strategy was released in 2017. “Since the original plan was released, the provincial government has made some positive changes to many programs and services for persons with disabilities,” said council chair Randy Dickinson. “However, we still have a long way to go to achieve full citizenship and equitable access, for all persons with a disability, in a predictable and consistent manner.” In developing the report, the council undertook an extensive consultation process. In an effort to engage with the community, council members organized a Disability Stakeholders’ Summit for key provincial stakeholders, circulated a provincial survey, held several public meetings throughout the province, and held one-on-one meetings with key disabilities stakeholders. The council relied on the information gathered during community consultations and the Disability Stakeholders’ Summit to form the foundation of this new action plan on disability issues. “This plan would not have been possible if not for the input from many New Brunswickers who shared their stories, challenges, experiences and most importantly, their ideas on how to make New Brunswick more accessible, equitable and inclusive,” said Christyne Allain, the council’s executive director. “We thank everyone for their time, passion and contribution.” The resulting disability action plan is a multi-year strategy that includes recommendations with a focus on employment, education, poverty, housing, disability supports, accessibility, transportation, recreation and wellness. The action plan demonstrates an effort to provide a pathway forward. It is intended to be flexible, innovative and responsive to the needs of New Brunswickers. The council will hold the government accountable for the disability action plan by monitoring the progress made in implementing the recommendations through regular public updates. 16-07-20"

It is sponsored by the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour and led by a non-profit organization, Mentor Apprentice Program Strategic Workforce Services. The program has also been supported by the New Brunswick Building Trades Unions. “The New Boots program has continued to be proven successful and not only am I pleased to see it continue; our government is taking steps to ensure that it will,” said Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour Minister Trevor Holder. “It has succeeded in getting more women to register for apprenticeship and has been an important resource hub for women in construction-related skilled trades.” The cost of extending the program to March 31, 2023 is just under $500,000. “We are very pleased with today’s announcement for the continued support of the New Boots program,” said Jean Marc Ringuette, president of New Brunswick Building Trades Unions. “Over the past five years the New Boots network has expanded from a cohort of 14 tradeswomen to over 250 tradeswomen today. Employers are also seeing an increase in women filling positions in the skilled trades”. Priority areas for the program over the next three years include aligning with: department objectives related to training and labour; poverty reduction and women’s equality initiatives under the New Brunswick Family Plan Framework; the Social Development Strategic Plan; and the government’s economic growth and development targets. “Our partnership with New Boots resulted in nine women investing in developing skilled trades through our Skilled Trades Exploration Program for Women last year and joining our team,” said Linda Speedy, vice-president of human resources with J.D. Irving Ltd. “As we continue to grow our business and invest in the region, we look forward to continuing partnerships with government and community agencies that focus on increasing the representation of women and other underrepresented groups in our workplace.” Since its inception, the New Boots program has established connections for and among hundreds of female trades workers around the province. Program goals over the next three years include: connecting 36 women annually to a skilled trade job; increasing the program’s social media presence by 25 per cent; creating new opportunities for participants by fostering relationships among trades groups and employers; and finding more tradeswomen who can serve as counsellors to those who may face barriers entering male-dominated trades. 16-07-20"

The program now includes private sector home care support workers and early learning and childcare enhanced support workers who provide direct client care. “This program sets out to help frontline workers who are providing personal care to our vulnerable population,” said Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour Minister Trevor Holder. “These workers are vital to our COVID-19 recovery and I thank them for their contributions.” Private sector home care support workers who provided direct, in-home personal care to clients of the Department of Social Development during the period from March 19 to July 9 will be eligible to receive the benefit. The amount of the benefit is dependent on the number of hours provided to the client during the identified timeframe: $500 for hours at or above 30 hours a per week; $250 for hours of at least 20 but less than 30 per week; and $100 for hours of at least 10 but less than 20 per week. The benefit will be distributed through the client who received the service to the private sector home care or family support worker. Enhanced support workers working in early learning and childcare centres will receive monthly payments over 16 weeks of $500 a month and the first and last payments will be split to align with existing payment schedules. They will receive their top-up retroactive to May 19 and it will continue for 16 weeks. This is in recognition of their return to work when the child care sector reopened. Employers will be reimbursed by the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. “It is important to our government to constantly review our policies and procedures for best practices,” said Social Development Minister Dorothy Shephard. “We have done that in this case and are pleased to be partnering with our federal colleagues to amend and expand this program. I am confident that the funds will be helpful to many workers who provide essential support to clients of the Department of Social Development.” The following essential workers have already been eligible to receive wage top-ups through this program:  early childhood educators in early learning and childcare facilities;   home support workers providing direct in-person care to seniors, adults and children;   direct person care in group homes, community residences, special care homes, homeless shelters and transition houses;   domestic violence intervention workers; and   food bank and soup kitchen workers.  “We know the early childhood education sector has always played an important role in supporting our economy and positioning New Brunswickers for lifelong learning and success,” said Education and Early Childhood Development Minister Dominic Cardy. “Over the past year, workers in this sector have truly demonstrated their dedication and significant value and I thank educators and enhanced support workers for their ongoing commitment to young learners.” More information about the updated wage top-up is available online. 14-07-20"

The renewal of all licences, registrations, certificates and permits has been extended to July 31, 2020, unless suspended by a court or by other authority. Customers who must visit a service centre in person are reminded to keep two metres of physical distance from others and have a mask with them if physical distancing cannot be maintained. The number of people allowed to wait inside air-conditioned waiting rooms will be limited in accordance with Public Health guidelines. Anyone with a pre-booked appointment for a road or written driver’s test should identify themselves to the commissionaire. Traditionally, wait times at Service New Brunswick have averaged just under 15 minutes compared to the North American average of 44 minutes. However, due to the increased demand, lines and wait times are expected to be much longer. Wilson thanked Service New Brunswick centre staff for their hard work and dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic. “The public may not realize that Service New Brunswick employees have been on the job the entire time during the pandemic, working 12-hour days, seven days a week,” said Wilson. “Service centre staff were redeployed to help their colleagues on the phones and online.” The toll-free information line and email created by the provincial government to respond to non-health related questions about COVID-19 is staffed by Service New Brunswick employees, who have responded to 6,406 emails between April 20 and June 21 as well as more than 30,000 phone calls since the information line was set up in March. Service New Brunswick employees also staff the MyHealthNB website, which provides New Brunswickers who were tested for COVID-19 at an assessment site with access to their test results. Service New Brunswick’s regular Teleservices line and online transactions have seen a significant increase in volume due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, motor vehicle registration renewals online and through Teleservices have increased 56 per cent from an average of 5,433 per week in 2019 to an average of 13,542 per week in 2020. 10-07-20"

The Travel Registration Program website will allow those who intend to travel to pre-register, verify that they meet the health screening criteria and see what documents are required to enter the province. Travellers who pre-register will be given a registration document and information about current health guidelines. Travellers who reside in the Atlantic provinces will be approved if they meet the health screening criteria. Restrictions still apply to travellers from other provinces and territories. “The health and the safety of New Brunswickers is our priority,” said Public Safety Minister Carl Urquhart. “New Brunswickers have worked hard to flatten the curve and border screening helps protect our communities from COVID-19. Until today, travellers coming to our province have been providing their information at screening points. With this new service, we will address those requests clearly and consistently while also limiting delays.” Everyone entering New Brunswick by land, air or sea must register. That includes residents of New Brunswick and the other Atlantic provinces. Each adult entering the province, including a New Brunswicker returning after travel outside the province, needs to complete their own registration. Children may be listed on one registration along with the primary applicant who is their parent or guardian. Unaccompanied minors need their own registration. People who travel regularly, such as daily commuters travelling for work, to fulfil a custody order or to receive medical treatment, can apply for a multiple-use registration. “Implementing this program improves our ability to support Public Health in the event of an outbreak,” said Urquhart. “Information will be retained for six months and can only be shared for public health purposes.” During the pandemic, New Brunswick has consistently permitted travel through the province to reach other destinations. Travellers from outside Atlantic Canada must register and are only permitted to stop for food, fuel and personal needs while travelling through the province to reach their destination. Every person entering New Brunswick must follow the advice of the chief medical officer of health, including self-isolating within New Brunswick for 14 days if ordered. The latest guidance is available online. People can register online or by calling toll free 1-833-948-2800 (Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Atlantic time). It is recommended that travellers register at least five days before their intended date of arrival in New Brunswick, though turnaround time on their registration may be faster. Travellers who arrive at the border without having pre-registered will still be able to apply at the border but may face delays. Travellers who have obtained permits or authorizations to travel to other provinces, including Prince Edward Island and Quebec’s Magdalen Islands will still be required to pre-register to enter New Brunswick. New Brunswickers should consult the websites of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador before travelling to these provinces to determine the current regulations and documentation required. 09-07-20"

These two projects required a total investment of $45 million over the past four years from both the provincial and federal governments. The official opening marks an important step towards the completion of the Fundy Trail Parkway development. “Today’s announcement was a long time coming, but well worth the wait as people will now be able to experience the most stunning view on the east coast, no matter the season,"" said Premier Blaine Higgs. “This is a magnificent addition to what Tourism New Brunswick has to offer and is sure to put our province on the map when it comes to must-see destinations.” The new road extends about 12.7 km from the eastern gate of the Fundy Parkway towards Creek Road, south of Sussex. Its construction also involved enhancements including ditching, brush cutting, guiderail and slope stabilization on the existing Creek and Waterford Roads going towards Sussex. The new observation deck provides a view over Walton Glen Gorge. The area also offers a unique experience for visitors at the Little Salmon River Protected Natural Area. “Today’s official opening of the Fundy Trail Parkway is a huge step forward for tourism in this spectacular part of New Brunswick,” said federal Economic Development and Official Languages Minister Mélanie Joly, who is also the minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. “This beautiful route will help more visitors discover the Bay of Fundy and the region’s many hidden gems, while supporting local tourism as it recovers from COVID-19. Our message to our tourism sector is clear: we have been here for you with immediate measures, we are here for you now as our economy reopens, and we will get through this together. We are working with you to support good jobs and help New Brunswick tourism come back strong.” The Fundy Trail Parkway is a 2,559-hectare park that welcomes more than 50,000 visitors per year. It features views along the shore of the Bay of Fundy and is operated by the not-for-profit organization, the Fundy Trail Development Authority Inc. With more than 30 km of road, the park provides multiple opportunities to seek out beaches, waterfalls, rocks and cliffs. Visitors can access 20 trails ranging from easy strolls to challenging wilderness hikes along the Fundy Coast, four waterfalls and eight points of interest including the Walton Glen Gorge, the Flower Pot Rock at Fownes Head, a 284-metre suspension footbridge crossing the Big Salmon River and an interpretive centre. “After 25 years of dedication and hard work, we are pleased to reach a new milestone in the development of the Fundy Trail Parkway project,"" said Greg Turner, president of the Fundy Trail Development Authority Inc. “So many people have envisioned and dreamed about developing this beautiful area where visitors can view the natural, unspoiled beauty of the Bay of Fundy coast. Today’s openings will allow the park to develop even more in the future.” The connector road to Sussex and the observation deck are part of the Fundy Trail Parkway project, which began in 1995 with the objective of creating a world-class destination. At that time, it included an area that ended at Big Salmon River. A major expansion of the park was undertaken in 2007. Thanks to the completion of the bridge located at Big Salmon River in 2008, further expansion was possible, and the parkway was completed in 2018. 07-07-20"

This scam involves fraudsters advertising properties they do not own for rent, often on online platforms, using information and photos from legitimate real estate listings. Victims have reported that after responding to these ads, they have been asked to pay hundreds of dollars in cash to cover the first month’s rent and damage deposits, before discovering the rental properties do not belong to the scam artist. In one case, the victims arrived at the supposed rental location with their moving truck only to find out that they had lost their money and did not have a place to live. This scam has been active in the province for at least a year, and has occurred throughout New Brunswick, through several different websites. Warnings have been issued by the commission, as well as New Brunswick real estate boards, local police departments and the RCMP since late 2019. Mitch McLean, registrar of the New Brunswick Real Estate Association, said his organization has been working closely with local real estate boards to combat this rental scam. “Progress has been made to reduce the risk of loss to members of the public by identifying and removing rental ads using pictures taken from actual real estate listing sites, which are currently being used as part of these scams,” said McLean. “Public awareness and education on how to spot these scams remains paramount in our pursuit to eliminate the risk of financial loss.” Some of the red flags identified in rental scams are:  No ability for the potential renter to see the property in person before providing a deposit. Asking the renter to e-transfer a deposit, or meet at a location other than the property, to provide a deposit. Asking the potential renter to ignore the for-sale signs on the property. Spelling errors and typos in the ads. Pressure to act quickly.  New Brunswickers are encouraged to consider the following best practices before paying money to secure a rental property:  Be aware of the red flags of fraud. Never send money to someone you’ve never met, or only met online. Before signing a rental agreement and paying a damage deposit, insist on seeing the property in person. If you are moving from out of province, ask someone you know locally to look at the property for you. Do a reverse image search to determine if the images are shared on other websites. If there is a for-sale sign on the property, contact the listing realtor to inquire if the owner is also seeking to rent the property. If you are entering a rent-to-own situation, seek legal advice before signing a contract. When purchasing or negotiating on resale sites such as Kijiji, it is always buyer beware. When using sites such as Realtor.ca, you are dealing with licensed agents. Learn more about how licensing can protect you.  “At the commission, we share information on the red flags of fraud and information about current scams circulating in the province in an effort to help New Brunswickers protect themselves and their communities,” said Alaina Nicholson, director of consumer affairs. “While scams change and adapt, the red flags tend to be common across different types of scams. The more people can recognize the red flags, think critically about offers and be vigilant, the fewer people will end up being scammed.” If you suspect that you have been targeted by, or are the victim of a rental fraud scam, contact the police. The commission is responsible for the administration and enforcement of provincial legislation regulating mortgage brokers, payday lenders, real estate, securities, insurance, pensions, credit unions, trust and loan companies, co-operatives, and a wide range of other consumer legislation. It is an independent Crown corporation funded by the regulatory fees and assessments paid by the regulated sectors. Online educational tools and resources are available online. 06-07-20"

With July, August and September typically being low-flow months, there is even more reason to conserve water now. “We often take water for granted because New Brunswick is fortunate to have so many sources of clean water,” said Carr. “But everyone should be thinking about how they can reduce water use whether they are on a private well or on a municipal system.” The Department of Environment and Local Government suggests the following ways for residents to conserve water:  avoid washing vehicles; avoid watering lawns; avoid filling swimming pools; use washing machines and dishwashers less frequently and with full loads only; take quick showers to minimize water used for washing; consider plumbing alterations, such as installing low-flow faucets; and check for leaks in plumbing systems, such as leaking faucets and toilets, and repair as necessary.

Since 2012, the number of charges being filed with the provincial court has dropped by 48 per cent in Tracadie and 35 per cent in Caraquet. “It is evident that the demand for court services on the Acadian Peninsula has declined significantly over the past decade,” said Justice Minister and Attorney General Andrea Anderson-Mason. “Despite diminishing court volumes in Caraquet and Tracadie and pressures in relation to resources, we have worked hard to find a solution that will allow us to keep these courts open, while making better use of the capacity in our system.” The new operating schedule, which takes effect in early August, will vary week-to-week based on the number of hearings needed per provincial court. “These changes will have no effect on the quality and accessibility of court services being provided to residents of the Acadian Peninsula,” said Anderson-Mason. “We have said all along that we want to make evidence-based decisions that allow us to improve services for residents.” The changes will allow the department to enhance services for families by reinvesting resources in a child-support recalculation service. This service will allow parents who have separated to update child support amounts based on changes to income without involving the courts. This will result in a less costly process for parents and reduce the burden on the court system. This service is expected to roll out during the current fiscal year.   30-06-20"

This year, we are not able to mark the occasion as we normally would. Our country, along with the rest of the world, is still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot participate in large-scale group activities like parties or concerts, but we can still find ways to celebrate. In New Brunswick we are in the fortunate position of having access to parks and beaches. Canada Day is a wonderful time to experience the natural beauty around us, while remembering to follow physical distancing guidelines. For others, this will be the perfect opportunity to get together with a few loved ones and close friends for a backyard BBQ. Canadians are known for their kindness and strength, and those qualities have shone through brighter than ever during the past few months. Throughout these difficult times we have seen many examples of people helping their neighbours, friends and families. We have shown how strong we are, and we will continue to persevere by working together in the days ahead. Despite the uncertainty we are all experiencing right now, I hope that on July 1 you feel the same gratitude I do in being a Canadian. As a nation we have accomplished so many great things, and with our resilient spirit, we will take on whatever the future may hold. Happy Canada Day! 30-06-20"

Amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act allow victims of domestic violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence or stalking to end their lease early. Those with fixed term or year-to-year leases are able to give one month’s notice rather than the current three months. Fixed term leases have specified notice periods. For a tenant to qualify for early termination of a lease, they will be required to provide the landlord with one of the following:  an emergency intervention order; an order of the court; or a Third Party Declaration provided by a system contact with the victim (e.g. peace officers; victims services co-ordinators; domestic violence outreach workers, crisis intervener or support worker, or indigenous chief or elder).  The change is one of a series of legislative changes aimed at better supporting those experiencing domestic violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence or stalking. Other legislative changes in recent years are:  the Insurance Act no longer penalizes victims for damages caused by an abusive partner. the Occupational Health and Safety Act now requires employers to assess the risk of violence in the workplace. the Employment Standards Act now allows victims of domestic violence, intimate partner violence or sexual violence to apply for leave from work. the new Intimate Partner Violence Intervention Act allows victims to apply for an emergency intervention order.  30-06-20"

One example of the new bundling choices is the big game option, which bundles deer, bear and varmint licences for residents at a reduced fee. The fee for licences for resident minors has also been eliminated, and when a fishing licence is purchased an ice fishing licence is included at no extra cost. The New Brunswick Wildlife Federation, which represents hunters and anglers, supports the new purchasing options. “This is great news,” said Nathalie Michaud, president of the federation. “Eliminating the resident minor licence fee will certainly increase youth participation in our hunting heritage sport and including the ice fishing licence in the general angling or salmon licence is a great move. We commend Minister Holland and the department on this great initiative.” More information on the bundle options and fees is available online. 29-06-20"

We want to balance the freedom to travel with precautions that will limit the spread of COVID-19. I am confident that the plan, which we have created together, strikes that balance.” On July 3, New Brunswickers will be able to cross interprovincial borders into the other Atlantic provinces without the need to self-isolate provided they:  have not traveled outside of the Atlantic provinces for any reason, including work or personal travel, in the past 14 days (New Brunswickers returning from work in another Canadian province or territory continue to not be required to self-isolate when they return to New Brunswick); have not been advised to self-isolate; are not awaiting results of a COVID-19 test; are not experiencing at least two of the following symptoms: fever above 38°C or signs of fever (such as chills); a new cough or worsening chronic cough; sore throat; runny nose; headache; a new onset of fatigue; a new onset of muscle pain; diarrhea; loss of sense of taste or loss of sense of smell; and in children, purple markings on the fingers or toes.    “Limiting the movement of people has limited the movement of the virus, and that has kept our case numbers relatively low,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “But I am convinced that we can reconnect with others and still stay safe, if we remain committed to protecting ourselves and our loved ones.” Atlantic Canadians will be able to travel to and from New Brunswick without the requirement to self-isolate but will be asked to provide proof of their province of residence. Visitors from other Canadian provinces and territories must self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival and may then travel within the Maritime provinces. Each Atlantic province will choose its own public health processes to track and monitor people that enter their province.

The study was conducted by the Maritime Province Higher Education Commission. The most popular programs pursued were graduate degrees:  44 per cent of graduates pursued a master’s degree or PhD; 17 per cent enrolled in a second bachelor’s degree, including seven per cent who enrolled in a bachelor of education program; 16 per cent enrolled in a college program or apprenticeship; and seven per cent enrolled in a professional degree such as medicine or law.  “Pursuing another credential after a first degree is a common pathway for Maritime university graduates,” said commission CEO Catherine Stewart. “Many students intend to pursue a graduate or professional degree before they even start university.” The commission conducted a survey of Grade 12 Maritime high school students in 2014 and found that 65 per cent of university-bound students intended to complete a credential above a bachelor’s degree. The main reasons to pursue further education were career-related:  29 per cent said it was part of their chosen career path; 29 per cent said it was for career advancement or a promotion; 12 per cent of graduates who pursued further studies did so to learn more about a subject.  Graduates in the labour force reported that the education they pursued after their first degree was necessary for their current job (75 per cent), was related to their current job to at least some extent (90 per cent), and they used skills learned at least to some extent (93 per cent). “What is interesting is the extent to which graduates said their programs were related to their job,” said Stewart. “More than 60 per cent of graduates chose ‘to a great extent’ when asked how much the programs they pursued after their first degree were related to their current job.” The Class of 2012 Six Years On: Pursuing Education After a First Degree report provides statistics on programs pursued after a first degree. Additional statistical tables with provincial breakdowns can be found on the commission’s website. The total sample of 2,630 respondents represents 25 per cent of the total Class of 2012 bachelor’s graduate population of the 14 universities in the Maritime provinces that offer undergraduate degrees. The report focuses on 1,901 first degree holders and results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 per cent, 19 times out of 20. All statistics presented have been generated from weighted data; data were weighted on the basis of the university of graduation and gender. The Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission was established in 1974 as an arm’s length organization accountable to the ministers responsible for post-secondary education in the Maritimes. It comprises 20 members representing universities, the public-at-large (including students), and the three Maritime provincial governments. The commission’s mandate is to give first consideration to improving and maintaining the best possible service to students as lifelong learners. 23-06-20"

The Yellow level includes the gradual reopening of more businesses and activities while working to prevent a resurgence of the virus. “This will enable us to continue to reopen our economy and put New Brunswickers back to work,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “Two thirds of New Brunswick businesses are fully open already; more than in any other province. We are on the right path, making the hard decisions and taking the actions needed as we all come to terms with this new normal.” During this phase of the Yellow level, more restrictions are being eased, subject to maintaining physical distancing measures, general guidelines from Public Health and the Guidelines for New Brunswick Workplaces issued by WorkSafeNB. Businesses that choose to reopen during this phase must prepare an operational plan respecting Public Health guidelines that can be provided to officials, if requested. Effective Friday, June 19:  Overnight camps will be allowed to open.   Indoor visits with one visitor at a time for residents of long-term care facilities will be permitted, if the facilities are able to do so. (Unless the visitor requires support, in which case, two visitors at a time will be allowed.)   New Brunswick residents no longer need to self-isolate when returning from work in another Canadian province or territory but they should self-monitor.   Canadian residents owning property in New Brunswick will be permitted to enter the province provided they self-isolate for 14 days, or the duration of their visit if it is shorter than 14 days.   Canadian residents can visit family members in New Brunswick provided they self-isolate for 14 days, or the duration of their visit if it is shorter than 14 days.   All organized sports are permitted with appropriate distancing and sanitizing.   A cap on the number of people gathering in controlled venues is lifted. Occupancy is based on the ability to maintain physical distancing between participants that are not close friends and family. This includes churches, swimming pools, saunas, waterparks, rinks, indoor recreational facilities and organized sports which previously had a gathering limit of 50 people.   Venues with indoor events with controlled entry or controlled seating are required to maintain records of users’ contact information to allow Public Health to conduct targeted follow-up should there be a COVID-19 exposure at the facility.  If the virus infection numbers remain manageable, the following restrictions are anticipated to be lifted, effective Friday, June 26:  All remaining businesses can open with appropriate distancing and sanitizing, and operational plans respecting Public Health guidelines.   Zone 5 will move fully into the Yellow level with the rest of the province provided the outbreak continues to be managed.  Zone 5 Currently, Zone 5 remains at the Orange level of the province’s COVID-19 recovery plan. “We must be sure that the current outbreak has been contained before we are able to move Zone 5 out of the Orange level of recovery,” said Higgs. “I understand this is frustrating to those who live and work in the Restigouche region, but by taking the proper precautions in the short term, we will positively impact our province in the long term.” The following rules apply to Zone 5:  A two-household bubble is permitted. Your household can join up with one other household, if both households mutually agree. You must not have close contact with anyone else. You cannot join up with more than one household or bubble.

By following road and speed reduction signs in construction zones, motorists can ensure their own safety as well as that of our workers.” The Department of Transportation and Infrastructure is once again partnering with the New Brunswick Road Builders and Heavy Construction Association, WorkSafeNB and the New Brunswick Construction Safety Association on the annual safety campaign. “Everyone has a role to play when it comes to safety,” said Tom McGinn, executive director of the New Brunswick Road Builders and Heavy Construction Association. “This campaign is an important annual reminder to the travelling public to respect our construction zones and construction workers. By obeying construction signage and reducing their speed, motorists can assure they are not putting someone’s life at risk.” The annual campaign will include messages distributed through social media and on the radio. For safety reasons, speed limits are lowered in constructions zones. Drivers in New Brunswick are reminded that if they get caught speeding in highway construction zones they face double the minimum fine. “Each year, hundreds of men and women work long hours at construction projects to keep our roads safe for motorists,” said Oliver. “It is important that people slow down and do their part to keep everyone safe.” Oliver also encouraged all those involved in traffic control on provincial roads to review the Work Area Traffic Control Manual. 19-06-20"

More serious health effects such as gastrointestinal illness can occur if toxins are consumed. These toxins can also be harmful to fish, wildlife, livestock and domestic animals. “We understand residents want to be active and enjoy the outdoors, but they should consider the potential risks of exposure to blue-green algae,” said Dr. Cristin Muecke, deputy chief medical officer of health. “New Brunswickers should familiarize themselves with blue-green algae’s appearance, in order to avoid any of the risks associated with it this summer for themselves, their loved ones and their pets.” Blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) is a naturally occurring bacteria found in New Brunswick’s aquatic ecosystem but, under certain conditions, can increase in numbers to form surface blooms or benthic mats. These tend to occur during the warmer months. The public health advisory that was issued in 2019 for the Saint John River between Woodstock and Fredericton due to the presence of benthic mats remains in effect. Pet owners are advised that benthic mats that wash up along the shores of lakes and rivers can be toxic and particularly harmful to dogs. Dogs are attracted to their odour and should not be permitted to eat vegetation or floating mats, as they can be lethal if consumed. While most commonly blue-green in colour, surface blooms can also look green, red, brown, or yellow. Benthic mats form along the bottom of lakes and rivers and can look like clumps of vegetation that can appear black, brown or dark green in the water, but when washed up on the shore they may appear brown or grey once they have dried. They can also be attached to rocks or aquatic vegetation. “There are things you can do to help protect yourself while enjoying our recreational waters,” said Muecke. “Algal blooms can be unpredictable, so it is important that people always check the water before entering and avoid swimming in areas where there are visible blooms or mats.” Other safety advice includes:  Always supervise young children and pets near recreational waters. Do not swallow lake or river water. Bathe or shower immediately after swimming. Do not enter the water with open cuts or sores. Always wash your hands before eating. Do not handle benthic mats when wading, fishing or boating.  The provincial government supports various blue-green algae research projects through the Environmental Trust Fund. These projects, which are underway in the Saint John River and several lakes in the province, are intended to build a better understanding of the distribution of blue-green algae and their toxins.

The Staycation campaign is intended to build upon the momentum of the recent NBalways campaign which had the objective of restoring hope during the economic shut down due to the pandemic. Staycation aims to motivate people to take advantage of the tourism experiences available within the province. “There is so much to discover, explore and enjoy in our beautiful province,” said Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Bruce Fitch. “From Grand Manan to Miscou Island, from the Saint John River Valley to the east coast, there are options for day trips and trips lasting several days that include a variety of activities, attractions and experiences.” Videos from the campaign will show scenes from throughout the province with the main message being Welcome back. Developed with New Brunswick marketing firms, the Staycation campaign will run until November. A winter campaign will also be implemented to encourage participation in numerous winter events and activities in the province. Since the beginning of the pandemic, in March, the department has worked closely with the tourism industry to assess its impact and the challenges it has created. This has included a weekly conference call with members of the New Brunswick Tourism Industry Advisory Committee. The department has also engaged and invested in all regions of the province through the municipal and regional tourism associations. “The tourism industry has been hit hard by the pandemic,” said Fitch. “We now ask New Brunswickers to travel, explore and support local tourism operators. By doing so they will also help to restore our provincial economy.” As part of the campaign, the department will help regions and municipalities promote their priorities:  Parks, Scenic Drive/Road Trips, Accommodations, Outdoor Adventure, Local Food & Beverage & Coastal Communities.

The company's current approval expires on July 15, with the new approval taking effect on July 16. The approval follows a public consultation process that included a public review that ran from Dec. 20, 2019, to May 15, 2020. The refinery, which opened in 1960, was originally designed to process 38,500 barrels of crude oil per day. Two new process areas, constructed in 1976, resulted in the refinery becoming the largest in Canada. Continued improvements and process efficiencies mean the facility can now process more than 320,000 barrels per day. The refinery produces a range of fuels for transportation including, ultra-low sulphur gasoline, ultra-low sulphur diesel, jet fuel and combustion applications such as home heating oil, kerosene and Bunker C. Other fuels produced for use in more specialized combustion and transportation applications include butane and propane. The heaviest components of crude oil are used in asphalt, which is sold for paving. The information, along with approval conditions, can be viewed on the Department of Environment and Local Government website or at any regional office of the department. Class 1 major industries are required to comply with the Air Quality Regulation under the Clean Air Act, and to operate under the terms and conditions established in the approval to operate. 15-06-20"

It will run seven days a week. New Brunswick’s river ferries have a rich tradition dating back more than a century. Capt. William Abraham Pitt invented the underwater cable ferry and introduced it on the Kennebecasis River between Reeds Point and Gondola Point in 1903. In addition to their heritage and tourism value, the province’s ferries connect rural communities throughout southern New Brunswick, reduce commuting time and transport livestock and farm equipment to locations that otherwise may not be feasible to utilize. “Having reliable access to transportation infrastructure is critical for any community’s long-term viability and success,” said Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries Minister Ross Wetmore. “Restoring the ferry service will also ensure the tourism and agricultural sectors in Gagetown and surrounding communities continue to grow and thrive in the years to come.” There are currently six crossings on the Saint John and Kennebecasis Rivers operating free of charge and serving more than 3.5 million passengers each year.   15-06-20"

The Financial and Consumer Services Commission’s campaign is particularly appropriate now when many seniors are physically distancing to protect their health. “Through our work with seniors’ groups and with other regulators, we know that when seniors are isolated it increases their vulnerability to financial exploitation and fraud,” said Deb Gillis, senior legal counsel with the commission. “There are safe ways to remain connected with older family members, friends and neighbours.” During the campaign, the commission will share an online guide to encourage caregivers, friends and family members to connect with the seniors in their lives. Tips are included such as: scheduling regular telephone calls or virtual calls with loved ones; assisting with getting groceries or medications and having physically distanced visits when dropping these items off. The commission will also share an updated brochure later in the month on the province’s new legislation regarding power of attorney, and a video on how seniors can remain socially connected during self-isolation. Gillis said friends and family members should talk to the seniors in their lives about their finances, watch for the signs of financial exploitation, learn to recognize the red flags of fraud and take advantage of the estate planning tools and resources on the commission’s website. The commission recommends discussing with seniors the common frauds and scams stemming from the pandemic. These include the CERB email scam, unsolicited calls or texts giving medical advice or offering COVID-19 related products. The commission has a webpage devoted to such scams that are circulating in the province. Seniors are also advised to be mindful of other family members or people in their lives who may have become financially strapped due to circumstances caused by the pandemic and who could attempt to take financial advantage of them. In many cases, the perpetrators of senior financial abuse are trusted family members and friends. “Remaining socially connected, learning to recognize the red flags of fraud and exploitation, and talking about future financial plans can help protect New Brunswickers from becoming a victim,” said Gillis. “People should review their estate planning documents to ensure they are up-to-date. Seniors should consider who will have their power of attorney, ensure they are named in a legal document and discuss the financial roles they expect that person to undertake if they become unable to do so,” she said. “That way, family members may recognize when a person is acting outside of their authority. If these conversations are delayed until someone becomes ill, they are likely to be more difficult, hurried and emotional.” The commission has made the issue of senior financial abuse a priority, and is working with its regulatory counterparts across the country in proposing changes to address the issue. “World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is a good opportunity to highlight the issues surrounding senior financial exploitation,” said Gillis. “With 20 per cent of New Brunswick’s population in the senior age group, it is important to learn how to protect your loved ones every day from this devastating crime.” The Financial and Consumer Services Commission has the mandate to protect consumers and enhance public confidence in the financial and consumer marketplace through the provision of regulatory and educational services. It is responsible for the administration and enforcement of provincial legislation regulating mortgage brokers, payday lenders, real estate, securities, insurance, pensions, credit unions, trust and loan companies, co-operatives, and a wide range of other consumer legislation. It is an independent Crown corporation funded by the regulatory fees and assessments paid by the regulated sectors. Educational tools and resources are available online.   12-06-20"

However, families, learners and educators must understand the school and classroom environment will be quite different from the one they left in March 2020.” The Return to School: September 2020 plan outlines the operational requirements schools and school districts must meet while developing their COVID-19 operational plans. It works in conjunction with the Public Health guidance to the department and may be changed based upon the evolution of the pandemic. Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 will attend school full time and students in Grades 9 to 12 will be taught using blended learning methods, which supplement instruction in classrooms with distance instruction. This may include, online course work, guided projects, experiential learning or co-op placements. Some classrooms may have smaller groupings, depending upon the grade level. K-8 students will stay within their class grouping throughout the day. Transition times, such as arrival, breaks and lunches, will be staggered. Physical distancing is required for students in Grades 9 to 12 and will be observed to the greatest extent possible. “Teachers will identify gaps in learning from the 2019-20 school year and use a targeted approach, ensuring students meet the core curricular outcomes,” said Cardy. “While we are pausing the co-ordinated rollout of green paper initiatives for one year, we encourage schools to use concepts outlined in the Succeeding at Home document, such as mixed groupings, to meet student needs within the operational requirements for the 2020-21 school year.” Public access to school buildings will be limited to students, school staff and those who receive permission, in advance, from the principal. Students, staff and visitors will be subject to a screening process. Students, and their families, and staff must monitor themselves for symptoms outlined by Public Health and stay home if they feel unwell. Some schools may change their drop-off and pick-up schedules. “The pandemic situation is constantly evolving, and this plan will allow the education system to be responsive to the needs of educators and students throughout the 2020-21 school year,” said Cardy. The department will continue to work with educators, schools, and school districts in the coming months. More information on facilities, scheduling and transportation will be communicated directly to families through the school districts this summer as schools develop their individual plans.

It has allowed New Brunswick to be a leader in the reopening of its courts.” While courts have returned to near normal dockets, it will not necessarily be business as usual. Alternative options for attending court, such as telephone or video conferencing for certain types of hearings, will remain in place. “Court hearings can contain many variables and complications,” said Anderson-Mason. “We will continue to work with the judiciary and court participants to ensure that we can provide solutions deemed appropriate for matters to proceed. Since the courts are an essential component of our society, we must make adjustments and accommodations where possible to operate in this environment.” Measures are in place, including physical distancing requirements, to ensure the safety of court participants. Per the directives from the judiciary, courts continue to be restricted to participants who are necessary to the proceedings before the court. This includes counsel, accused, defendants, witnesses, complainants and/or victims, support workers and members of the media. The presiding judge may limit access to the courtroom as deemed appropriate. Anyone experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, or who have been advised to self-isolate, are asked not to attend a courthouse for any reason. Individuals whose presence is required for a proceeding, and who are experiencing symptoms or are self-isolating, should inform the appropriate court in advance. Counter services for all courts are once again available, but by appointment only. A list of court contacts is available online. 09-06-20"

The square has already been subjected to extensive surveys by ground-penetrating radar to better guide the archeological assessment. “Officers’ Square is the heart of our downtown and we know people are looking forward to it fulfilling its full potential as a place to remember our heritage and as our main community gathering place,” said Mayor Mike O’Brien. “It has taken longer than we had originally hoped, but this collaboration with the department is a major milestone in our journey toward a revitalized Officers’ Square.” Should any significant heritage artifacts be found, the department and the city will collaborate on a mitigation plan to ensure they are conserved during the upcoming phases of construction. The department will engage with First Nations representatives throughout the process and will begin a formal consultation with First Nations early this fall. Later in the summer, city crews will complete the wall revitalization by placing sandstone pillars, coping stones and sandstone fascia on the perimeter of the square. Additionally, sandstone will be installed on the Queen Street central stairs and the 104th Regiment monument will be returned to its prominent location. In the fall, contractors will complete the perimeter by adding the iconic metal railings into the balustrade.   09-06-20"

Located in Belledune, the generating station was commissioned in 1993. It was the first such plant in Canada designed with a Flue Gas Desulphurization system (also referred to as a scrubber). The facility, the second largest fossil fuel-fired generating station in New Brunswick, generates up to 490 megawatts from the combustion of pulverized coal as the primary fuel and petroleum coke as a blended supplemental fuel, in one large boiler. The information, along with approval conditions, can be viewed on the Department of Environment and Local Government website or at any regional office of the department. Class 1 major industries are required to comply with the Air Quality Regulation under the Clean Air Act, and to operate under the terms and conditions established in the approval to operate.   01-06-20"

Four patients are hospitalized with one in an intensive care unit. As of today, 28,462 tests have been conducted. This includes more than 2,000 tests that were processed on Sunday, which is the highest number of tests processed in single day since the pandemic began. “We are all in this together,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “With almost 300 people self-isolating, everyone, including those who recently tested as negative, needs to watch themselves for symptoms over the next 14-day incubation period.” New Brunswickers who were tested for COVID-19 at an assessment site were given a registration code which allows them to access their test results, usually within 48 hours, through the MyHealthNB website. If a test is confirmed as positive, the site will provide information on self-isolation and directions on how to prevent further spread of the virus. The site will also indicate if the person’s test is confirmed as negative or inconclusive. All the remaining residents on two separate wards at Manoir de la Vallée, a long-term care facility in Zone 5, were recently tested. All tests were reported as negative.

New Brunswick is the first Atlantic province to resume Class 5 testing, the most commonly requested test. There were about 500 Class 5 tests scheduled, then cancelled, when the COVID-19 restrictions were implemented in March. Customers that had tests previously scheduled will not have to rebook, unless their contact information has changed. “Service New Brunswick staff are contacting those who had a road test cancelled to schedule a new appointment for them,” said Service New Brunswick Minister Sherry Wilson. “We know there are many young drivers out there anxious to do their road test but we want to make sure everything is done safely for the examiners and the new drivers.” Road tests in the Campbellton region will resume when the region returns to the yellow phase. Those taking the test will be required to complete a COVID-19 health questionnaire and, since being in a vehicle does not allow for physical distancing, to bring and wear a face mask. Examiners will be provided with personal protective equipment, disinfectant wipes, and disposable seat covers for the testing vehicles. Service New Brunswick will announce when the online booking tool will be open to book new appointments, once the backlog is cleared.

MQM recently secured two contracts, with work to begin in early June, and intends to hire about 25 skilled workers over the next two years. “MQM is happy to secure an agreement with the province on a facility that is important infrastructure for the region,” said Serge Thériault, company president. “This facility will be an important part of MQM’s growth vision.” Headquartered in Tracadie, MQM has operated in the industrial construction field since 1993 and currently employs about 150 people. The Regional Development Corporation, through Provincial Holdings Ltd., manages the operations of the Bas-Caraquet Marine Centre. The Marine Centre remains active, in addition to the boat lift service the centre provides to the lobster and crab fisheries, there are three other employers on-site; Construction Navel Atlantic, Friolet Service Maritime and R.P.

Combined, these measures had been intended as an important first step in making the province’s tax system more competitive. “We are facing an unprecedent economic downturn and it will likely take a period of years before revenues stabilize,” said Steeves. “As we begin to move down a path to recovery, we will explore all options on how we can encourage economic growth in a sustainable manner.” 27-05-20"

The acquittal of Johnson in this case has raised many questions and comments from the public. In particular, some have stated that this case exemplifies how there is no justice for Aboriginal or Indigenous people in Canada. Public Prosecution Services releases this public statement, following our review of the trial decision for grounds of appeal, to address some of these questions and comments. Public Prosecution Services is well aware of the most recent comments from the Supreme Court of Canada in the 2019 R. v. Barton decision stating that “…Indigenous people are the target of hurtful biases, stereotypes, and assumptions, including stereotypes about credibility, worthiness, and criminal propensity, to name just a few…” and that “…discrimination experienced by Indigenous persons, whether as a result of overtly racist attitudes or culturally inappropriate practices, extends to all parts of the criminal justice system... In short, when it comes to truth and reconciliation from a criminal justice system perspective, much-needed work remains to be done.” (para.199) There is absolutely no indication from our review of this decision that racial bias or partiality played any role in the acquittal in this case. The decision was made on the basis of the evidence heard at trial and the applicable law. Brady Francis, of Elsipogtog First Nation, was tragically struck and killed by a vehicle on Feb. 24, 2018 in Saint-Charles. Maurice Johnson was subsequently charged in this hit and run accident. On April 28, 2020, the trial judge presiding over this case found Johnson not guilty of the offence and acquitted him of the charge. The judge concluded that the Crown did not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Reasonable doubt is a core principle of the criminal justice system that protects all persons in Canada who are charged with a crime. It refers to the obligation of the State to prove with certainty that an accused committed a particular unlawful act and that he or she did so with criminal intent. Our review of this decision takes into account that an appeal does not take the form of a second trial. It provides a review of the trial decision to determine if errors were made by the judge that impact on the ultimate decision of guilt or innocence. There is an extremely limited avenue for the successful appeal of an acquittal in our system of justice. Identifying an error of law alone on the part of the trial judge is not sufficient. Any error of law identified must be such that it would satisfy the appellate court that the error might reasonably have had a material bearing on the acquittal. This is considered to be a high standard to meet, described by the Supreme Court of Canada as the error being such “…that there is a reasonable degree of certainty that the outcome might well have been affected by it.” This limited avenue for appeal of an acquittal is justified by the regard had for the prohibition against double jeopardy. We recognize this principle in Canada through s. 11(h) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It states that individuals have the right not to be tried again for an offence for which they have already either been acquitted or convicted and punished. This is not interpreted to mean that the Crown cannot appeal an acquittal, but the limitation thereon is the Canadian way of giving expression to this principle. While the Crown believes there may be grounds to appeal the finding that the Crown did not prove that Johnson’s car struck Brady Francis, this is insufficient because of the trial judge’s finding on the issue of criminal intent that Johnson “…might have thought he struck a deer.” This is a finding of fact, not an error of law. It is well within the purview of the trial judge and is not appealable in this case. It is, in fact, fatal to the Crown’s ability to appeal this acquittal.   27-05-20"

If needed, alerts will be issued through the Heat Alert and Response System to inform New Brunswickers and community response partners when a heat event is coming. “While I encourage New Brunswickers to get outside and enjoy the warmer temperatures, it is important that we inform them of the risks of high heat so they can take appropriate health precautions when necessary,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. The heat alert system has three levels based on factors that characterize an extreme heat event: intensity, duration and nighttime exposure. The regional Public Health offices monitor meteorological alerting provided by Environment and Climate Change Canada to determine when it is necessary to issue a heat alert. New Brunswickers are reminded to take the following actions to prevent heat illness during any level of heat alert:  Drink plenty of cool fluids, especially water, before feeling thirsty.   Wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-coloured clothing.   Keep the sun out with curtains or blinds.   Plan outdoor activities around cooler parts of the day while respecting physical distancing.   Avoid exposure to the sun.   Never leave someone or a pet in your care inside a parked car.   Spend a few hours in a cool place or in an air-conditioned location while maintaining physical distancing, (i.e. a mall, library, church, shaded park or at a pool) or find a shaded area.   While following Public Health’s COVID-19 Community Public Health Measures, frequently check-in with vulnerable family members or neighbours to make sure they are coping well. Connecting virtually in light of COVID-19 is encouraged.   Avoid using the stove for cooking a meal.   Take cool showers or baths until refreshed. Use your air conditioner if you have one.   Make arrangements to spend time or sleep in a cooler place.   Sprinkle clothing with water.   Splash cool water on your face and back of neck.    Organizers of sporting events should follow the New Brunswick COVID-19 recovery plan. If outdoor sport events are allowed to occur, modify the rules to accommodate additional water breaks or consider rescheduling outdoor activities.  Heat alert advisories for the various cities and regions will be issued on the Department of Health Twitter account, @NBHealth, and the provincial government’s Facebook page.

The Financial and Consumer Services Commission is warning consumers to be wary of unsolicited offers that are COVID-related, particularly if they are asked to pay using a gift card. “From bogus offers for free face masks to fraudsters passing as health officials to collect personal information, frauds and scams evolve and adapt at a rapid pace to capitalize on our fears and stress,” said Alaina Nicholson, director of consumer affairs. “However, the red flags of fraud remain the same. In many of the recent reports, being asked to pay by gift card is one of the red flags that we are seeing.” The commission reminds consumers that no legitimate organization or business will ask clients to pay a fee using a gift card, and neither would someone selling an item from a buy-and-sell website. “Gift cards are used by fraudsters because once the card has been activated and the fraudster has the number and code, they are virtually untraceable,” said Nicholson. “Fraudsters will also try to pressure you to act quickly by offering limited time offers, threats of fines and other high-pressure tactics so that consumers do not have the time to think before they act, which is another red flag of fraud. Asking questions and thinking seriously before making financial or purchasing decisions is the best way to protect yourself from being victimized by a scam artist or from making a decision that is not in your best interest.” More red flags of fraud and details on common scams targeting New Brunswickers are available online. Consumers can receive regular updates, tips and fraud alerts from the commission by following the organization on social media. The Financial and Consumer Services Commission has the mandate to protect consumers and enhance public confidence in the financial and consumer marketplace through the provision of regulatory and educational services. It is responsible for the administration and enforcement of provincial legislation regulating mortgage brokers, payday lenders, real estate, securities, insurance, pensions, credit unions, trust and loan companies, co-operatives, and a wide range of other consumer legislation. It is an independent Crown corporation funded by the regulatory fees and assessments paid by the regulated sectors. Educational tools and resources are available online. 26-05-20"

They were developed in collaboration with the seven school districts, based on advice from Public Health. “I encourage schools to be creative in their planning and look at this as an opportunity to try new ways of celebrating,” said Cardy. Schools will be responsible for developing their individual graduation ceremony plans and submitting them to their respective districts for approval. Ceremonies are anticipated to take place between June 15 and 19. The final day for home learning options will be June 12. “I congratulate the graduating class of 2020 for their hard work over the course of their academic career, but also for their resiliency and compassion throughout this pandemic,” said Cardy. “I hope they continue to grow and pursue learning throughout their lives as they lead us into the future.”     26-05-20"

It was announced last week that Court of Queen’s Bench matters for the Fredericton judicial district would be moving to the Fredericton Convention Centre. This will provide space for a fourth full-time Queen’s Bench courtroom, when there are only three Queen’s Bench Courtrooms in the Fredericton Justice Building. “Fredericton’s Provincial Court has been experiencing a high volume of charges, both before and since the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Anderson-Mason. “Moving the Queen’s Bench out of the Justice Building will allow us to dedicate an additional courtroom to help with the provincial court docket. The efficiencies gained in merging the resources and capacity of the Burton docket within the Fredericton Justice Building will ensure the timely access to justice that everyone in the judicial district of Fredericton deserves.” Once COVID-related restrictions are removed the Queen’s Bench is expected to return to the Fredericton Justice Building and the Burton Provincial Court resources will move back.

Revenue is projected to be $291.4 million lower than budgeted because of pandemic-related effects. This is largely due to lower projections for provincial taxes, agency revenues, licences and permits, and interest revenue. Expenses are projected to be over budget by $100.2 million, of which $39.5 million is offset by federal revenue. This is largely due to increased expenditures in response to the pandemic. The net debt is projected to reach $14.1 billion, an increase of $266.7 million over the 2019-20 level. The Department of Finance and Treasury Board estimates that real GDP growth will be -4.3 per cent for 2020. The average real GDP forecast among private sector forecasters is -5.5 per cent. “This crisis underscores the importance of building fiscal flexibility and being disciplined during stable economic times,” said Steeves. “We are committed to providing support to New Brunswickers during this crisis while remaining strong fiscal managers to secure a brighter future.” The latest fiscal and economic update is available online.   21-05-20"

The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, praised the resiliency of New Brunswickers and the efforts that many have made to adjust to the stresses created by this pandemic. “As we move forward, we will need to continue to adapt, learn and prepare for the next phase of our recovery,” said Russell. “With each step we take, we are building resiliency, as individuals and as a province. As we adjust to each phase, there will be challenges that will test this resiliency. But as we figure out how to get through each situation, we will be stronger for the experience and better prepared for the challenges ahead.” Top-up funding for front-line workers “Since this pandemic began, essential workers across the province have stepped up for New Brunswick,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “In recognition of this, our province has sent a written request to the federal finance minister outlining a program to provide a monthly top-up of approximately $500 for 16 weeks for front-line workers in a number of sectors.” Those eligible for the funding include employees in:  early learning and child care facilities home support special care homes, community residences and group homes homeless shelters and food banks domestic violence outreach and transition homes Workers must earn $18 per hour or less to be eligible.  The top-up will be paid by employers every four weeks. The exception will be child care facilities, which will split the first and last payments to align with existing payment schedules. Workers at early learning and child care facilities will receive their top-up retroactive to May 19 and it will continue for 16 weeks. This is in recognition of their return to work as the child care sector reopened. All other sectors will be paid retroactively from March 19 to July 9. Employers will be reimbursed by the departments of Education and Early Childhood Development or Social Development. Early learning and child care facilities reopen More than 50 per cent of New Brunswick’s early learning and child care facilities reopened on Tuesday. That number is expected to reach 80 per cent by June 1. “The reopening of child care facilities is a key element in enabling people to return to work,” said Higgs. “New Brunswickers must be able to return to work if we are going to reopen our province.” Border restrictions remain in place All unnecessary travel into New Brunswick remains prohibited, and peace officers are authorized to turn away visitors when they attempt to enter. “As we continue to move through the phases of our recovery plan, it is important to remember COVID-19 still poses a risk to our communities.” said Higgs. “Quebec, Nova Scotia and Maine all have active cases of COVID-19, which is why we have chosen to keep our borders controlled at this time.” Higgs said it is recognized that travel by some people is necessary. This includes residents of other provinces who must enter New Brunswick to work or to receive medical treatment, and commercial vehicle drivers delivering goods. T-shirts promote provincial pride and support charity Stepping up for my New Brunswick / Faire ma part pour mon Nouveau-Brunswick T-shirts will be sold by the United Way, with proceeds going to support mental health initiatives in New Brunswick. “Stepping up in support of our province is something to be proud of,” said Higgs. “This is the latest in a long list of ways that New Brunswickers have shown their resilient and caring nature.

The coming weeks will allow staff and teachers to complete any outstanding tasks for the school year, including finalizing home learning options, participating in professional development opportunities, and preparing for the next school year. These returns to school may be staggered or based on schedules or shifts, depending on the school or district. Each district will be responsible for developing and communicating their return-to-work policy for staff, including providing orientation. The final day of work for teachers will be June 23. “Over the past few months, educators and school and district staff have been working hard behind the scenes,” said Cardy. “They have been busy adapting to this new reality while ensuring students have the opportunity to develop and grow. I want to thank educators, students and families for their excellent work and dedication in pursuing home-learning options and helping us flatten the curve.”   19-05-20"

After that date, landlords will be authorized to serve tenants with a notice to vacate for non-payment of rent. The Residential Tenancies Tribunal is encouraging landlords and tenants to work together to come up with a payment plan. “Throughout the state of emergency, the Residential Tenancies Tribunal has made extensive efforts to communicate to tenants that rent continues to be due and tenants financially impacted due to job losses must work with their landlords to come up with a payment plan,” said Service New Brunswick Minister Sherry Wilson. “The tribunal will continue to work with both parties to attempt a mediated agreement for payment when payment in full is not possible.” The tribunal will consider the details of each individual case, including the amount of rent owing; the active engagement of both the landlord and tenant to come up with a payment plan; and the availability and accessibility of financial support through provincial and federal government programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tenants who claim they have been unable to pay rent due to financial issues related to the pandemic will be required to provide evidence to support this claim. If a tenant has provided satisfactory evidence, he or she must then reach and follow through on a mediated payment plan agreement with their landlord if full payment is not possible. Tenants whose rent is left unpaid for reasons other than those directly related to the pandemic will be required to pay their rent in full or face possible eviction.

Water levels in all areas along the Saint John River basin continue to decrease and are returning to normal levels. “The freshet this year looked nothing like 2018 and 2019,” said Public Safety Minister Carl Urquhart. “While we are grateful for this, the New Brunswick Emergency Management Organization (NBEMO) and its River Watch partners were ready to respond.” The program started March 9 and provided information on the status of rivers and the potential for ice jams and other flood issues throughout the duration of the ice-out and spring freshet season. The program is a joint effort between the Department of Environment and Local Government, NB Power and NBEMO of the Department of Public Safety. Other partners include Environment and Climate Change Canada, watershed groups, and federal, provincial and state agencies involved in monitoring and forecasting the water flows in the province's rivers and streams. “The Department of Environment and Local Government’s Hydrology Centre is a key partner in the annual provincial River Watch Program,” said Environment and Local Government Minister Jeff Carr. “For the past several weeks, the centre has been collecting data from various sources to establish river modeling and five-day forecasting projections. Our efforts have helped residents stay informed of any risks that were identified.” Over the past 10 weeks, the River Watch 2020 team published public advisories, conducted interviews with provincial media, and kept people informed through Facebook and Twitter. “While the spring freshet is over, New Brunswickers need to stay vigilant about preventing the spread of COVID-19. Physical distancing is the best way to prevent the spread and we are counting on everyone to continue to do their part and follow the orders in the state of emergency declaration,” said Greg MacCallum, NBEMO director.   15-05-20"

Protect your two-household bubble Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, emphasized the importance of people maintaining and protecting the two-household bubble and limiting close contact to those within that bubble. “When you stay at home, or within your two-household bubble, you are denying the COVID-19 virus the opportunity to spread to others,” said Russell. “Every close contact you have outside your bubble increases the risk to your health and to the health of those within your bubble.” Russell also stressed the importance of people staying two metres away from those outside their bubble. When physical distancing is not possible, she recommends people wear a community face mask that covers their mouth and nose. Maintaining the two-household bubble is vital to the safe operation of daycares and early childhood education centres, which will reopen next week, said Russell. If each child in a daycare has close contact with only one other household, the risk of spreading the virus is greatly reduced. It is also important that parents and staff do not enter a daycare if they are feeling unwell. Business recovery More stores and restaurants have been opening during the past week. As others do so in the days ahead, business owners who need personal protective equipment for their employees can find information online about New Brunswick suppliers. If business owners have questions about the measures they must take to operate safely, they can contact the Opportunities NB Business Navigator line at 1-833-799-7966 or by emailing nav@navnb.ca.

We have good reason to be proud of the progress we have made as a province to minimize our risks and contain the spread of this virus. But we must also remember all of the hard work it took us to get to this point. We are still vulnerable to COVID-19. We have minimized the risks, but we cannot eliminate them completely.” Higgs also highlighted the fact that many retailers will be closed on Monday. “This will provide a much-needed rest for workers, many of whom have been serving the public and providing New Brunswickers with necessities throughout this pandemic, even when the rest of us were being asked to stay at home,” said Higgs. “This is a great example of residents stepping up for our New Brunswick.

They are also helping operators develop their COVID-19 Operational Plans. Operational plans outline how each individual business will be able to meet the requirements set out for reopening. For early learning and child care facilities, this includes keeping groups of children separated, enhanced cleaning, as well as mandatory screening for everyone entering the facility, including parents, children and staff. The full guidelines are available online. “These procedures are similar to the ones that were implemented in emergency child care facilities in March,” said Cardy. “Educators have done an outstanding job keeping the children of our essential workers safe. Now, we have slightly expanded group sizes for older children, who are better able to respect physical distancing, understanding that children under the age of five will be in groups of 10 children or fewer.” To support the enhanced cleaning practices, the department will provide operators with $20 per month for each licensed space until at least the end of June. This is part of a $1 million-per-month financial package to support operators as they begin to reopen through May and June. Anyone who has travelled outside of New Brunswick will not be allowed to visit early learning and child care facilities for 14 days. Since travel-related cases are the current risk, Public Health advises parents not to allow people who have travelled outside the province to self-isolate in their household bubble if their child is attending an early learning or child care facility. Parents are to ensure that the members of their household-bubble understand their responsibility not to introduce risk which could directly impact the daycare children and staff. Operators will be required to keep up-to-date information on children and staff, following screening practices. No one presenting with symptoms will be allowed to enter a facility until they contact 811 and are cleared to return. “This will not be business as usual, and operators and educators will have to work together to develop creative solutions that work for their families and facilities,” said Cardy. “Depending on the facility, this might include more time playing and learning outside or planning new games and activities to help children learn and promote their overall well-being.” Parents are encouraged to contact their child care provider to find out more about their facility’s operational plan. For more information about the guidelines and requirements, parents can contact early learning staff at 1-833-221-9339, Monday to Friday, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., or by email at ECSAP-PASPE@gnb.ca.   14-05-20"

We are in this together, and we can get through it together.” Vulnerable New Brunswickers Russell urged New Brunswickers to be mindful of the impact that COVID-19 can have on vulnerable members of society. The elderly are particularly susceptible, as are those with underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, lung disease, cancer and diabetes. Complications are also possible in those with weakened immune systems. The homeless and those with addictions or substance use issues as well as residents of special care homes and adult residential facilities are at risk. Russell said New Brunswickers can protect the vulnerable by avoiding visiting them if you feel unwell and by offering to pick up groceries and other supplies for them, so they can avoid places where they may come into contact with the virus. Working NB Virtual Job Fair On May 12 and 13 the provincial government hosted a virtual job fair to help connect those looking for jobs with employers.

The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said the emergence of a second case in two days, after more than two weeks with no confirmed cases, was not unexpected. “We are in the midst of a global pandemic,” Russell said. “We have fared better than most jurisdictions, but we cannot completely shut ourselves off from the effects of this disease. We will see more cases. What matters is how we respond when new cases arise.” Protecting vulnerable New Brunswickers Russell emphasized the need to protect the province’s most vulnerable, especially the 12,000 people who reside in New Brunswick’s 549 nursing homes, special care homes and other adult residential facilities. “In Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia, nursing homes have been devastated by multiple deaths from this disease,” said Russell. “No one wants that to happen here. We must make sure our long-term care residents, as well as those who work in these facilities, stay healthy and safe.” Russell said actions taken to protect the vulnerable and elderly, including restrictions on visiting, screening of staff and the use of personal protective equipment, will remain in place. Border restrictions Premier Blaine Higgs said border restrictions have been helping to contain the spread of the virus. “I know people are concerned about our borders. I am, too,” said Higgs. “I am discussing our border controls with the all-party cabinet committee, and if we find room to improve, I assure you that we will make changes.” Law enforcement officers are authorized to deny entry to any person who does not have a valid reason for travel in or through the province. Since border controls were implemented on March 25, five air travellers have been denied entry to the province. Over the past 10 days, an average of 38 vehicles have been turned away daily. Travel through New Brunswick Under the state of emergency, non-essential travel is restricted and any person who comes to the province and is remaining here is required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Those travelling through the province on their way to another jurisdiction will be screened on arrival at a land border or airport and made aware of Public Health directives. Those who pass screening will be told to proceed directly to their destination. Job opportunities and preparing to open Regional WorkingNB staff from the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour are working with employers and job-seekers looking for support. “If you are one of the New Brunswickers that currently does not have a job to return to because of the pandemic, I encourage you to visit the WorkingNB website to apply for the available jobs,” said Higgs. “We understand the urgent need to fill positions in various sectors, including fisheries and agriculture.” Job opportunities will be uploaded to JobMatchNB over the next few days. Employers are also encouraged to participate in the free virtual career fair May 12-13 at www.WorkingNB.ca. “I have been encouraging business for weeks to prepare for the new normal and reopening,” said Higgs. “We are days away and I am asking you again to plan and prepare.

These measures will support home learning and help families stay connected.” As part of the Continuity of Learning Plan, the anglophone and francophone sectors have each developed delivery plans and supporting materials that reflect their unique approaches and correspond with their curricular outcomes. Each sector has secured technology to support these delivery plans and associated home learning options. Over the past month, the department has been working with school districts and teachers throughout the province. Each family has been contacted, and a survey conducted, to learn what technology is available to each student at home. The new devices, along with existing school and district technology resources, will be distributed to students who require these tools to complete their home learning options. MiFi Hubs will be available for students who do not have access to the internet at home. “These devices will help students continue to learn from home, and also provide families of limited means the ability to stay up to date with information from the provincial government as we live through this pandemic,” said Cardy. Distribution of the devices to families will be co-ordinated through the schools in the coming weeks as students pick up their personal belongings. Students will be expected to return the loaned devices at a specified date.   06-05-20"

The program, launched today by the Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture, aims to address some of the challenges social isolation has caused for professional artists and for people who enjoy art and culture. Artists who have had their exhibition, project, showcase or performance cancelled due to the pandemic can receive up to $2,000 for an artistic presentation on social media. Cultural businesses or entrepreneurs who use digital means to promote themselves or their products in a new way are also eligible to apply. “Like most small businesses and people who are self-employed, professional artists in New Brunswick have been hit hard by the pandemic crisis and isolation,” said Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Bruce Fitch. “Most tours, shows and exhibitions have been cancelled. These activities are essential for the cultural sector of our province and represent an important source of income for artists from all sectors.” Arts organizations and similar associations may also apply. All proposals must respect any physical distancing and self-isolation directives issued by the provincial government. “These performances will represent unique opportunities to promote professional artists and cultural sector workers,” said Fitch. “These artists will not only be able to entertain members of the public through social media, but they will also have the opportunity to promote their own products.” Last month, the department partnered with Music NB to provide similar assistance to professional musicians. Musical artists may submit their proposals to Music NB, which will then help selected artists promote their performances. Information on the Special Projects program is available online.   06-05-20"

New case is not connected to WestJet flight to Moncton Public Health received word on Monday that a person confirmed to have COVID-19 was a passenger on WestJet flight 3456 to Moncton on April 27. The government took immediate steps to inform New Brunswickers as soon as it was made aware of the incident. Russell said the person was not tested in New Brunswick and that this case is separate from the new one announced today. “We have determined that the person in question landed in Moncton and, while we believe the person is not in New Brunswick, we are confirming with another jurisdiction the person’s whereabouts,” said Russell. “The established protocol for travel by known cases, where provincial and territorial officials are expected to notify their counterparts in the receiving jurisdiction, was not followed in this case. We have reached out to federal government officials to get information about this situation, and to discuss what can be done to try to reduce the risk of this happening again.” Russell said any person who travelled on this flight is directed to self-isolate for 14 days and to contact Tele-Care 811 or their primary health-care provider if symptoms of COVID-19 emerge.

The number of confirmed and recovered cases in New Brunswick remains at 118. The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said New Brunswickers must continue to stay at home, practise physical distancing, and wash their hands frequently to help slow the spread of the virus. “Going as long as we have with no new cases is a significant achievement, matched by very few jurisdictions anywhere in the world,” Russell said. “We have flattened the curve in New Brunswick. But keeping it flat will require continued vigilance, sacrifice and co-operation from everyone in our province.” Russell said maintaining controls on the province’s borders is required to limit the spread of the virus from neighbouring jurisdictions. But even with these controls, she said it is likely that there will be more cases in the weeks and months ahead. “Just because we have not detected new cases does not mean the virus is gone,” said Russell. “Continued success will be measured by how we respond to new outbreaks if they happen.” Job-matching platform launched A virtual job matching platform called JobMatchNB was launched today to connect New Brunswickers with available positions. Employers can add jobs into the system and they will appear on the site within a few days. “We need New Brunswickers to step up for New Brunswick to fill these positions,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “By stepping up, you will be playing an important role in helping your community, and our province’s economy.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online. 04-05-20"

The number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick remains at 118 but all affected individuals have recovered. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that with the onset of better weather, it remains important to follow Public Health’s recommendations on bubbling. “As we begin the third week of no new COVID-19 cases, I recognize families want to get outside and spend more time together,” said Russell. “But it is crucial that everyone adheres to the rule about two households bubbling only with each other. Also, when outside, it is important to continue to practise physical distancing.” “I would also strongly urge New Brunswickers to get tested if they have any two of the symptoms, even if those symptoms are mild,” she said. Testing protocols for COVID-19 have recently expanded. If you or a member of your family are showing two of the following symptoms, contact Tele-Care 811 for further direction:  fever above 38°C;   a new cough or worsening chronic cough;   sore throat;   runny nose;   headache;   a new onset of fatigue;   a new onset of muscle pain;   diarrhea;   loss of sense of taste or loss of sense of smell; and   in children, purple markings on the fingers or toes.  The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online. Cautious optimism Premier Blaine Higgs said New Brunswick has been a leader in the fight against COVID-19 on many levels. Residents listened to the advice of Public Health, stayed home, washed their hands frequently and respected physical distancing, all of which contributed to the positive results the province is now reporting, he said. “We have been able to manage a very difficult situation with positive results so far, and the fact that we are now entering the third week with no new cases is cause for cautious optimism,” said Higgs. “But we must remain diligent in our efforts to keep New Brunswickers safe and healthy. Throughout our country and in neighbouring jurisdictions there are new COVID-19 cases, and sadly deaths, daily. We must stay on guard and take precautions until a vaccine is found.” Higgs said that if New Brunswick continues on this path, residents will see fewer restrictions in the weeks ahead as the province moves into the next phase of economic recovery. “We have come a long way, but we are still vulnerable,” said Higgs. “We expect to have more cases. Our province is still under a state of emergency, and we must continue to follow the advice of Public Health.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   03-05-20"

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that although the curve has been flattened and everyone has recovered, there is still a need for caution. “Achieving this two-week milestone is significant,” said Russell. “But I cannot emphasize enough how important it is for us to continue practising physical distancing, wearing face masks and staying home as much as possible.” People are urged to call 811 if they have symptoms and follow directions provided by Public Health. The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online. Encouraging milestone Premier Blaine Higgs welcomed the positive news and said the province was able to reach this significant milestone by following the advice from public health. “I thank everyone, the frontline workers, essential workers, public safety employees and all New Brunswickers for helping us reach this milestone,” said Higgs. “Of course, we did not win the war yet and this victory may be short-lived. But what is important is that we find the balance between returning to a new normal while still staying on guard and protecting the health of our residents.” Weekend gatherings Higgs said New Brunswickers must continue to keep their distance from each other even though the government has removed several restrictions for outside activities such as golfing, fishing and gardening. “May is a synonym for warmer days and New Brunswickers are absolutely right to spend time outside. This is not only because the weather is nice but also because it is important for their mental health,” said Higgs. “We encourage everyone to safely enjoy our province’s beautiful outdoor spaces as long as they keep a two-metre distance from others.” Higgs also reminded the public that members of a household are only allowed to spend time with one other household. He said they cannot pick and choose different households and relatives to visit. “We know everyone is excited about spending time with their loved ones and we are pleased we were able to loosen the restrictions,” added Higgs. “However, people must not take advantage of this less restrictive phase. If individuals start attending gatherings that extend beyond their two-household bubble right now, we could begin to see a resurgence of cases of COVID-19.” Riverwatch The New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization reminds residents to be aware of rising water levels over the coming days and of the potential for a minor impact in the Saint John River watershed. Those living near waterways are encouraged to take appropriate precautions. New Brunswickers are asked to stay off the waterways at this time as the water is cold, levels are high, currents are strong and could be carrying debris.

Protect. #VaccinesWork. Publicly funded routine immunization starts at birth, continues through all stages of life, and is available at no cost to New Brunswickers. The New Brunswick Routine Immunization Schedule outlines routine immunizations recommended for infants, children, adolescents and adults which are provided by a variety of health-care professionals free of charge. “New Brunswickers must continue to manage their health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that includes following the routine immunization schedule,” said Dr. Chris Goodyear, president of the New Brunswick Medical Society. “Immunization is a safe, proven way to protect us all, including those most vulnerable to infectious disease such as children, pregnant women and seniors. It is quite simple: vaccines work.” Misinformation about vaccines is widespread and the volume of news and data may be confusing. A registered health-care provider is the best source of information and can provide guidance on accessing vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic. People should talk with a doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local public health office about the immunizations needed to keep their families healthy. More information on immunization is available on the Department of Health website.   01-05-20"

The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online. Two-household bubble Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, reminded New Brunswickers to keep extended contact to two households only. She said a “two-household bubble” will safely allow greater contact among people, but only if direct contact is strictly limited between the two groups. “It is very important to stay in your bubble – one household unit joined with another household unit – and avoid the temptation to go beyond it,” said Russell. “If you have matched up with a family friend or relation, neither group can form a bubble with anyone else. This sets up the potential for a chain of contagion where infection could be passed between groups. The potential consequences of this could be tragic.” Border restrictions remain in place Under the province’s state of emergency mandatory order, border restrictions remain in place. “We need people outside the province to understand that New Brunswick is closed to unnecessary travel,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “Travellers who are trying to enter for non-essential reasons are being turned away. These steps are necessary to keep New Brunswickers safe.” Nearing two weeks of no new cases New Brunswick has gone 13 consecutive days without a new case of COVID-19. “Some may think we no longer have to worry about the virus,” said Higgs. “We are still vulnerable. We are surrounded by COVID-19 and, though we are doing our best to keep New Brunswickers safe, we are still at risk.” Russell emphasized the continued importance of testing for the virus and urged those experiencing symptoms to call 811 and follow directions given by Public Health. “We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go,” said Russell. “By continuing to support each other we will maintain the success we have built together.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   01-05-20"

The mandatory order issued under the state of emergency due to COVID-19 that had banned all open fires has been lifted. However, burning restrictions may still be in place in some areas based on ground and weather conditions. As of today, May 1, all counties remain closed for burning. Restrictions for areas where burning is regulated by the province are updated at 2 p.m. each day. Current burning restrictions and the Provincial Forest Fire Summary are available online. Under the Forest Fires Act, if you ignite a fire on forest land, you are responsible for it. If your fire gets out of control, you may be liable for the cost of fighting the fire and/or damage to another person’s property. You may also face criminal penalties for violating burning regulations. Anyone igniting a Category 1 fire (fires with a diameter of three metres or less) should ensure burning is allowed in that area. This can be done by calling the toll-free burn line at 1-866-458-8080 or by visiting the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development website. Category 2, 3 and 4 fires require a written permit. Applications are available at the department’s district offices. Burning grass is considered a Category 4 fire. People who deem it necessary to burn grass must submit a written burn plan to the department, have an inspection beforehand, and then receive a written permit. During fire season, anyone who conducts an industrial operation on forest land must possess a valid work permit that specifies the required fire equipment and the location of the operation. Permits can be obtained at any of the department’s district offices at no cost to the applicant. Inspections will be conducted by officers throughout the season to ensure compliance with industrial operations. Cities, towns and some villages have bylaws that restrict burning. It is the public’s responsibility to understand and follow these bylaws. Details on other burning permits are available at the nearest office of the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development or by calling, toll-free, 1-866-458-8080. Because of concerns related to COVID-19, the government is offering essential services only at this time. All offices of the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development are closed until further notice. To obtain a permit, call your local district office and follow the instructions provided by voicemail. In 2019, 182 fires burned 228 hectares of forest land in New Brunswick. Forest land includes any land outside the boundaries of a city or town, not cultivated for agricultural purposes, on which trees, shrubs, plants or grass are growing. It also includes blueberry fields and peat bogs.   01-05-20"

The regulation also provides job protection for employees who cannot report to work because they are caring for their children due to school or daycare closures. “We want to minimize the pressure on workers and protect their jobs during the pandemic,” said Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour Minister Trevor Holder. “This is another measure we are taking to help ensure the health and safety of workers and workplaces.” Employees must request this emergency leave from their employers, in writing, as soon as possible. The request must include the reason for the leave, the anticipated start date and the duration of the leave. Employers are not required to pay employees while they are on a leave due to COVID-19.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said the government will continue to move cautiously in its recovery plan, to give businesses, workers, the health-care system and the public enough time to adjust to the “new normal.” “It is very likely that New Brunswick will see COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks and months,” said Russell. “Preparations must be made for a second wave of infections that may strike later in the year. Other jurisdictions have learned a painful lesson about the cost of rushing back to normalcy. I want us to learn from their experiences.” Support available to businesses and workers WorkingNB services are available to any New Brunswick employer or job-seeker looking for support. Staff are available to provide services over the phone, and more options will be available in the near future. “We know that, to have an environment where businesses and New Brunswickers can get back on track and thrive, we need to start re-energizing our private sector,” said Holder. “Our WorkingNB offices are a valuable piece of that puzzle for employers and job-seekers.” Businesses with human resource challenges, including with recruitment, retention or training, can contact WorkingNB for support through a workforce consultant. Workers seeking career or training opportunities can connect with an employment counsellor at WorkingNB. Counsellors can help clients identify career goals and connect them to the labour market through training and employment opportunities. Staff will also be working with municipalities and economic development agencies to help address community challenges. More information about WorkingNB is available online.

Recovery plan phases are flexible The province’s recently announced recovery plan contains public health alert levels that outline when various sectors will reopen and when certain activities will be permitted. New Brunswick is transitioning to the orange phase, which is aimed at reopening social and economic settings while preventing a resurgence of transmission. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, urged New Brunswickers to continue to maintain physical distancing and appropriate hygiene practices as the province gradually moves toward reopening. “The phase we are now entering will be, in many respects, more difficult than what we have been through so far,” said Russell. “Whether we are as successful in the next six months as we have been in the last six weeks depends entirely on you. Your actions, now more than ever, will determine what happens next.” Premier Blaine Higgs reminded New Brunswickers that the pandemic is evolving constantly and that people must be prepared to be flexible and adjust their behaviour as needed. “We may be able to loosen restrictions on one type of business or activity included in a certain stage while still restricting other activities that are part of the same level,” said Higgs. “This pandemic is a new experience for all of us. Things are changing every day and we are learning as we go.” Restrictions that have been eased may be reinstated at any time to protect public health. Helping businesses with reopening planning Businesses that might be allowed to reopen in the weeks and months ahead are looking at how to adjust their operations, so they can conduct business safely. “I know business owners want to do the right thing and operate safely once they are allowed to reopen,” said Higgs. “Each sector is going to have unique needs and requirements that will involve planning and activating new operational requirements.” Businesses are encouraged to review the Guidance Document of General Public Health Measures during COVID-19 Recovery, which includes pre-screening tools, signage templates and other information. Engagement sessions with specific sectors are being developed. These sessions will allow business owners to hear directly from officials at Public Health, WorkSafeNB and relevant government departments. Opportunities NB will issue a webinar on May 8 about economic recovery. It will feature an expert panel providing tips and answers to common questions that businesses might have as they get ready to reopen.   Temporary foreign workers Higgs said that, throughout this pandemic, the provincial government has acted with an abundance of caution, which has allowed New Brunswick to fare much better than other jurisdictions where less restrictive policies have been used. “The decision to restrict temporary foreign workers from entering the province was made to protect the health and safety of New Brunswickers,” said Higgs. “We must continue to exercise caution. To do otherwise puts us all at risk of contracting COVID-19.”   Higgs said steps will be taken to help affected businesses. They include:  Exploring opportunities to fill vacant positions by recruiting from the 30,000 post-secondary students; 7,000 Grade 12 students about to graduate; and tens of thousands of unemployed people who have been displaced by COVID-19.

People with positive results will be contacted by Public Health, which will monitor the person’s condition through follow-up calls.” The new symptoms are:  a new onset of fatigue;   a new onset of muscle pain;   diarrhea;   loss of sense of taste or loss of sense of smell; and   in children, purple markings on the fingers or toes.  These symptoms are in addition to:  fever above 38°C;   a new cough or worsening chronic cough;   sore throat;   runny nose; and   headache.  Russell noted that in the case of children with purple markings on their fingers or toes, testing will be done even if none of the other symptoms are present. “It is crucial that we do more testing at this stage, and with a broader range of symptoms,” said Russell. “This list of symptoms covers our current knowledge of the signs of COVID-19. As we continually learn more about the virus, and as symptoms are confirmed, they will be added to our testing protocols.” Priority in processing tests will continue to be given to those most vulnerable to the disease, including patients in hospitals and residents of nursing homes and special care homes. Priority will also be given to those working in the health-care sector, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and staff in health-care institutions. Temporary foreign workers restricted from entering province The provincial government has updated its mandatory order under the state of emergency to restrict temporary foreign workers from entering New Brunswick. Premier Blaine Higgs said with so many serious outbreaks of COVID-19 in surrounding jurisdictions, the province’s borders must remain closed for now. “Under normal circumstances, we welcome foreign temporary workers as they play an important role in New Brunswick’s continued economic growth,” said Higgs. “But right now, the risk of allowing more people to enter the province is simply too great.” This restriction does not affect the status of temporary foreign workers currently in the province.

That is why we are working with our partners to ensure interested Grade 12 students accepted into one of the province’s publicly-funded universities can begin working towards completing their post-secondary programs.” With parental consent, students who are on track to graduate in June may enrol in intersession courses to accrue credits towards their degree beginning in the fall. This would be concurrent with their obligations to complete the public-school year as currently being offered under the continuity of learning plan. “Intersession courses allow our students to smoothly transition from high school to university over the summer months,” said Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour Minister Trevor Holder. “Our universities are offering a valuable opportunity to students wishing to kick-start their first year and I encourage students looking for an extra challenge to explore this option.” These courses will be available online with no physical attendance required. Standard intersession fees will apply. Once enrolled in these courses, students of the public education system would be obliged to abide by any policies or requirements of the university offering the course. The University of New Brunswick (UNB) will be offering introductory courses using remote learning over the summer to incoming students. Students may choose from over 40 courses that can be applied to their university degree. Additionally, UNB will offer courses that are applicable to the transition to university, and remote learning skill-building workshops that will better prepare them with the skills they need to be successful in the post-secondary environment. “We are committed to exploring all avenues to help our students succeed,” said Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor. “The opportunity for incoming students to begin their post-secondary education will help ease the transition to university and will provide some stability in these uncertain times.” Admitted incoming students at St. Thomas University are eligible to enrol in intersession courses that begin shortly. The web-based courses in biology and political science begin next week, while a course in human rights begins in May. The university has communicated directly with all incoming students about this opportunity. “Every year, a number of high school students begin their university education early with introductory courses,” said Kim Fenwick, vice-president, Academic and Research. “These courses provide students with the opportunity to challenge themselves while also creating a rewarding introduction to university-level courses.” Grade 12 students admitted to Mount Allison University for the fall are eligible to enrol in one self-directed distance learning course for the spring/summer term, which begins on May 4 and runs until the exam date of Sept. 5. Students can choose from more than 20 first-year and second-year online courses in the arts, science, and music.

The number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick is 118, the number of active cases is six, and 112 people have recovered. Three people remain hospitalized, and there are no patients in an intensive care unit. The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that while testing results remain encouraging, real success against the COVID-19 virus will be measured by New Brunswick’s ability to manage new outbreaks as they occur. “Let me be clear, we are nowhere near ready to declare victory over the COVID-19 virus,” Russell said. “We will continue to have cases during the recovery phase. Success is not merely the absence of new cases. Success is knowing how many cases we really have, how widespread the disease has become, and that we are able to manage it so that our health-care system is not overwhelmed.” Russell urged New Brunswickers to continue to watch for symptoms of COVID-19 which include fever, cough, sore throat, running nose, and headache, and to call 811 and seek testing if symptoms emerge. She also stressed the importance of continuing appropriate hygiene practices, maintaining physical distance from others and strongly recommended masks when physical distancing or other barriers are not possible. Large gatherings still not allowed Premier Blaine Higgs reminded New Brunswickers that although the province has entered into an early phase of recovery, several rules remain in place. It is now possible for families and neighbours to visit another household unit, or “bubble.” Both households must mutually agree to only get together with one another. Individuals must limit their gatherings to these two households only. Golf courses, driving ranges, beaches and parks can now open, as long as physical distancing and safety measures are in place. All public playgrounds are still off limits, including those in municipal parks, provincial parks and at schools. Team sports, motorcycle gatherings and any gatherings of vehicles are still not allowed at this time. Driving ATVs is permitted, however, trails are not yet open. “We are pleased that we were able to lessen the restrictions,” said Higgs. “However, we remind everyone that this is not a free-for-all. New Brunswickers are still not allowed to participate in large gatherings. If we want to continue to move forward, following the rules that are still in place is more important now than ever before.” Law enforcement Law enforcement agencies are still focusing on educating the public whenever possible, but tickets are being issued when necessary. In the past week, 22 tickets were issued. A total of 77 tickets have been issued since the state of emergency was declared. “Ticketing people is a last resort,” said Higgs. “But we will continue to issue them as long as people break the rules. If we all continue to follow the rules, we will be able to enjoy even fewer restrictions in the weeks and months to come.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   27-04-20"

We want to give citizens and businesses every opportunity to recover from this crisis. We must follow a strategic, methodical approach to get there.” Recovery guidance document available The first phase of the provincial government’s COVID-19 recovery plan began on Friday. The plan contains several colour-coded public health alert levels to methodically, gradually and cautiously reopen businesses, educational facilities, the health-care system, recreational activities and cultural events. Premier Blaine Higgs thanked New Brunswickers for helping to fight the pandemic. “Thanks to your co-operation, we have been able to start easing some of the restrictions that have been in place for several weeks,” said Higgs. “We have come so far together; please continue to follow the directives of Public Health and the emergency order as we take these first steps so that, soon, we will be able to take the next steps forward.” A guidance document, which is available online, outlines health measures for the general public and businesses, service providers and organizations that have been permitted to open during the first phase of recovery. Restrictions that have been eased may be reinstated at any time to protect public health. “We are starting to see hopeful and encouraging signs, but that does not erase the reality that this virus remains out there,” said Higgs. “You still need to continue to practise physical distancing and hand-washing. You can expect to see some people wearing masks in public, limits on the number of people in a store, and surfaces being regularly cleaned. This is how we will keep New Brunswickers safe and healthy.”   Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   26-04-20"

Wash it after using it and do not share it with others.” Premier Blaine Higgs said the recovery phase, which began on Friday, should not be taken lightly. “We are opening the door slightly and we want to continue to loosen restrictions,” said Higgs. “However, we need to be vigilant during this phase and follow the directives of Public Health.

Roland was a man who believed in public service. Over his almost 20-year political career he served as the mayor of Petit-Rocher from 1995 to 1999 and as the MLA for Nigadoo-Chaleur from 1999 to 2014. During his time in the legislative assembly, Roland held multiple cabinet portfolios, including Education and Environment and Local Government. A passionate and kind man, Roland cared about his constituents and he represented them with great distinction.

The fact that over the past few days there have been no new cases is cause for measured optimism. I must say our success to date can largely be attributed to the ability of this group to put partisan politics aside and put New Brunswick first. Everyone in the province is focused on the same goal, whether they work in the departments of health, public safety or other frontline services, or whether they are at home doing their part by physical distancing. Your success thus far has made the next step possible.” “We are fortunate that we have the lowest number of COVID-19 cases per capita of any province in Canada” said Vickers. “We are thankful for the exceptional work of Dr. Russell, our public health officials, our front-line workers and all those who have played a role in supporting New Brunswickers through this difficult time. We are all anxious to have businesses back up and running and to returning to the activities and social interactions we enjoyed prior to this health crisis. It is imperative, however, that we follow the guidelines and direction of Public Health laid out in the recovery plan. Let's all continue to do our part to protect ourselves, our families and our fellow residents. Stay safe.” “New Brunswick has been a national leader in the COVID-19 fight with the fewest cases per capita in the country which is a testament to how bi-partisan cooperation works in the best interest of the people,” said Austin. “I believe it is now time to begin to re-open the economy while adhering to strict guidelines to prevent the spread and keeping our borders locked down to non-essential travel” “I am so proud of everyone for their commitment to keep each other safe, secure and healthy,” said Coon. “Together, we have written the first chapter in the story of our fight against COVID-19. We will need that same dedication to take care of each other as we begin chapter two, particularly to look after the vulnerable and those most affected by the consequences of the pandemic.” The plan to re-open businesses, educational facilities, the health-care system, recreational activities, and cultural events will be guided by four distinct public health alert levels:  Red: This is the present phase aimed at flattening the curve and containing the virus as quickly as possible.   Orange: The goal of this phase is to balance the reopening of social and economic settings while preventing a resurgence of transmission.   Yellow: The goal of this phase is to further increase the reopening of social and economic settings after the ability to control transmission has been demonstrated.   Green: This phase will likely come after a vaccine is available or more is learned about how to protect people from the virus.  The phased plan will allow health experts to monitor and evaluate the impact of the lifting of restrictions. At any time, restrictions that have been lifted may quickly be reinstated to protect public health. Restrictions may be put in place based on provincial, regional or local circumstances such as unlinked community outbreaks or cases that cannot be traced. “We will continue to carefully monitor COVID-19 in the province. This includes testing and tracing,” said Russell. ""New Brunswickers must continue following public health measures. Even as we begin to remove restrictions, you will be required to continue to practise physical distancing and good hygiene.” As a first step, the following will be allowed effective today:  Two-household bubbles: Households may now choose to spend time with one other household, if both households agree. The selection made is not interchangeable.   Golf courses and driving ranges: If all physical distancing and safety measures are in place, golf courses and driving ranges can now open.   Recreational fishing and hunting: The delay on springs seasons has been lifted.   Outdoor spaces: With physical distancing, people can now enjoy the outdoors including parks and beaches.   Carpooling: Co-workers or neighbours can carpool if physical distancing measures are maintained by transporting the passenger in the backseat.   Post-secondary education: Students requiring access to campus to fulfill their course requirements will be able to do so.   Outdoor religious services: As an alternative to online worship, religious organizations can hold outdoor services if parishioners stay in their vehicles that are two metres apart.  A guidance document of the public health measures during the recovery phases is being developed and will be available soon.

There are five patients hospitalized, including one patient in an intensive care unit. The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, thanked New Brunswickers for their continued adherence to physical distancing and other practices that have slowed the spread of the COVID-19 virus. She said it is important that these practices continue as elements of the “new normal” when restrictions now in place are gradually loosened. “My advice to New Brunswickers has been clear and consistent since the pandemic began and it will not change in the weeks ahead,” said Russell. “Let’s not lose the advantage we have built over the last six weeks.” Recovery plan on the way Premier Blaine Higgs said the provincial government will present a recovery plan in the coming days. “Recovery is not as easy as flipping a light switch,” said Higgs. “We have to be strategic and make sure that the government, daycares, businesses, restaurants and shops can operate with the necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of their employees and customers. I caution everyone that recovery comes with risks and we need to minimize those risks.” Removal of the 30-day limit on prescription drugs The 30-day limit on prescription drugs will be eliminated for drugs where shortages do not exist. In some cases, the limit had resulted in people paying additional dispensing fees and co-payments. “We realize this is a difficult decision, but in light of the unprecedented circumstances we are in, we strongly believe this is the right one,” said Higgs. “We are taking this action to ensure that our vulnerable population is not put in a position where they have to choose among paying for their medication, buying groceries, or paying their rent.” However, the government will create a working group which will identify those drugs which could experience a shortage and put in place a 30-day supply limitation if necessary in order to protect the supply. Higgs praised pharmacists in the province for their co-operation and collaboration with this complex issue. “During this difficult time, pharmacists have played an important role in our communities as essential front-line workers,” said Higgs. “Our government understands that pharmacists want to ensure residents have the medications they need. We share the same concerns and that is why we will create this working group to keep a close eye on the drug supply, and to identify any anticipated drug shortages.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online. 23-04-20"

There are five patients hospitalized, including one patient in an intensive care unit. The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said the test results continue to be encouraging. But she urged New Brunswickers to practise physical distancing when they go out. Continued adherence to these practices will help prevent the re-emergence of the virus, she said. “This is not the end,” Russell said. “I ask that you continue to observe the restrictions set under the provincial state of emergency and continue to take precautions against the spread of the virus, even when those restrictions have been eased.” Ramadan celebrations Russell reminded New Brunswick’s Muslim community that communal meals traditionally held to break the daily fast during the holy month of Ramadan are not permitted under the current state of emergency. Only gatherings of people currently sharing a home are permitted. She suggested Muslims participate in online events that will allow them to safely practise the tenets of their faith. Assistance to help families stay connected The provincial government is providing nursing homes with iPads to help residents stay in contact with loved ones. Each nursing home will be provided with one iPad for each 10 residents, for a total of about 480 tablets. The government is working with BrunNet Inc., which will be responsible for delivering the tablets to nursing homes and for providing support as needed regarding their use. In addition, to maximize the use of the tablets, each will be equipped with a virtual care application. This feature will enable physicians to provide care to residents remotely. “We are very pleased to announce this initiative,” said Premier Blaine Higgs.” We understand how difficult it is for nursing home residents to be cut off from their families. We hope this will give residents and staff a great option to help keep families as close as possible under the circumstances. “Our government will explore more ways it can use these tablets to improve the lives of nursing home residents,” said Higgs. “This is just one way we are using technology to our advantage during the COVID-19 pandemic.” Toll-free line The toll-free information line which was set up to help answer non-health related questions, including questions about compliance with the state of emergency, has been useful. Early statistics from Service New Brunswick show that more than 8,000 calls to this line have been responded to since its launch on March 23. The number, 1-844-462-8387, offers services in both languages and is operational seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The email address is helpaide@gnb.ca. Depending upon the nature of the query, a caller may be directed to resources such as Opportunities NB’s Business Navigator or to WorkSafeNB. Complaints about non-compliance with the state of emergency are referred to law enforcement agencies for further review. High level of compliance Higgs said he is pleased to see that New Brunswickers are complying with the state of emergency order, as only in a very small number of cases has enforcement been required. As of April 20, 29 tickets had been issued across the province for violations of the order. “The level of co-operation across New Brunswick, from law enforcement officials to the individuals patiently waiting in line at the grocery stores, is amazing,” said Higgs. “New Brunswick is on the right track and thanks to everyone’s co-operation we anticipate that we will be able to reduce some of the restrictions under the emergency order very soon.” Open fires prohibited New Brunswickers are reminded that under the emergency order, all open fires are prohibited until May 1. Conditions across the province vary. Even after receiving significant amounts of rain, grasslands dry very quickly and become extremely flammable. Under these conditions, a fire can spread quickly. The ban on open fires applies to any burning where combustion products are not vented through a stack or chimney. It does not apply to stoves and barbecues that burn gaseous material or briquettes or to CSA-approved outdoor fireplaces. Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   22-04-20"

The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online. Secure web portal for COVID-19 test results                      With support from Canada Health Infoway, the provincial government has set up a secure web portal to enable eligible New Brunswickers to obtain faster access to their COVID-19 test results. This website will provide information to those who have been tested at an assessment centre. It can be accessed through the MyHealthNB website. Effective today, those who have been tested for the virus at an assessment site will be given a registration code for the website. This code will enable them to check for results as soon as their tests have been processed, usually within 48 hours. “With this new portal, patients will be able to access their test results faster from the safety of their home,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “The quicker access to test results will relieve some of the stress associated with the testing process and enable those with positive tests to take immediate actions to protect the health of their family and community.” If a test is confirmed as positive, the site will provide information on self-isolation and directions on how to prevent further spread of the virus. The site will also indicate if the person’s test is confirmed as negative or inconclusive. Those with positive results will be contacted by Public Health, which will monitor the person’s condition through followup calls.   Support for non-profit groups The provincial government added a new category under the Community Investment Fund to support non-profit groups affected by COVID-19. This funding will provide eligible small to medium-sized non-profits with grants between $500 and $10,000. “New Brunswick’s non-profits and community groups play an important role in building vibrant communities, and they will help us rebuild our economy following this pandemic,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “This assistance is designed to address gaps within the existing support being made available by the federal government.” The application form and program information can be found online. Interprovincial border restrictions remain in place Higgs said, although the number of cases in New Brunswick remains low, the province is still vulnerable to further spread from other provinces and people need to remain diligent. “We are still surrounded by COVID-19,” said Higgs. “Because of this, we can expect that our borders may remain closed for some time. If you have been outside the province for any reason and any amount of time, you must still self-isolate for 14 days.” Recovery planning New Brunswick’s recovery from the pandemic will be discussed this week at the all-party cabinet committee meeting. “We must reopen our communities and our province methodically, and gradually, to ensure we do not set ourselves back,” said Higgs.     Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online. 21-04-20"

That means continuing to stay at home, in your own home, as much as possible.” Premier Blaine Higgs thanked New Brunswickers for their hard work and sacrifice in keeping the cases of COVID-19 at a minimum. “Because you paid attention and put the health and safety of your fellow New Brunswickers first, we have been able to slow the virus’s spread,” said Higgs. “We have been fortunate in New Brunswick, but we must not take this for granted. We must continue to follow the directives of Public Health.” Kearl Lake work site Russell reported on a recent COVID-19 outbreak at an oil sands work site at Kearl Lake, Alberta, north of Fort McMurray. The outbreak has been linked to cases in British Columbia and Saskatchewan, where workers from the site returned home. Russell urged any New Brunswickers who have recently been at Kearl Lake, or have had close contact with anyone recently working there, to self-isolate for 14 days as per travel instructions and call 811 for further instructions. “Even if you feel well and are showing no symptoms, you may still be carrying the virus and may infect others around you,” said Russell.

Of the 118 cases, 66 are travel-related, 42 are close contacts of confirmed cases, nine are the result of community transmission and one is under investigation. During the pandemic, 13 people have been hospitalized and eight have since been discharged. Three of the five patients remaining in hospital are in an intensive care unit. To date, 87 people have recovered. As of today, 10,347 tests have been conducted. The new case is an individual aged 30-39 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region). Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, thanked New Brunswickers for their understanding and patience during the past few weeks, but cautioned that the road ahead is still long. “It is going to be a beautiful weekend and some people may be tempted to see family and friends,” Russell said. “I encourage you to send your love with a phone call or an email. This is a health-care crisis that does not discriminate based on where you live, what you do, your age or gender.” Russell said people need to continue to practise physical distancing and to wash their hands thoroughly and frequently. Anyone experiencing two or more of the following symptoms should contact 811 and follow the directions provided:  fever above 38°C;   a new cough or worsening chronic cough;   sore throat;   runny nose; and   headache.  Premier Blaine Higgs asked New Brunswickers to keep in mind the progress that has been made in fighting COVID-19. “The low number of cases reported in our province is promising, but we all must continue the fight to beat this virus,” said Higgs. “If we all keep following the directive of Public Health, I am confident we will see fewer restrictions in the weeks ahead. Like all of you, that is something I am very much looking forward to.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   18-04-20"

Of the 117 cases previously confirmed, 66 are travel-related, 42 are close contacts of confirmed cases and nine are the result of community transmission. During the pandemic, 13 people have been hospitalized and eight have since been discharged. Three of the five patients remaining in hospital are in an intensive care unit. To date, 83 people have recovered. Continued vigilance necessary Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said these results are encouraging but warned that the gains the province has made could quickly be lost if the public does not remain vigilant in preventing the spread of the virus. She urged New Brunswickers to continue to stay at home as much as possible, and to keep interactions brief when they go out. She said it remains important for people to practise physical distancing, and she suggested wearing a non-medical mask that covers the mouth and nose when physical distancing is not possible. New Brunswickers are urged to continue to monitor themselves and their families for the symptoms of COVID-19:  fever above 38°C;   a new cough or worsening chronic cough;   sore throat;   runny nose; and   headache.  Anyone experiencing two or more of these symptoms should contact 811 and follow the direction provided. “If we all remain vigilant against this disease, and consistent in our practices to limit its spread, we can continue to have good outcomes,” said Russell. “If we let down our guard, the virus will take advantage and resume its spread through our communities. We have seen the tragic consequences of this in other jurisdictions around the world. No one wants that to happen here.” Premier Blaine Higgs echoed her comments. “We cannot make the mistake of going back to our regular lives too early,” said Higgs. “If we do, we could see a resurgence of cases. We all have to continue to play our part.” Higgs said that even when the current restrictions are reduced, it will not be business as usual. “We are not at the point where non-essential businesses can reopen, but it is important that they take these factors into account as they plan for the future,” said Higgs. “I encourage business leaders to start considering how they can reopen once it’s safe to do so, while taking new measures to protect the health of their patrons.” Higgs shared the same message during a conference call with municipal leaders earlier today. He answered questions about the eventual economic recovery and addressed their concerns. Higgs told the mayors that some festivals and celebrations in the summer months are likely to be cancelled or postponed this year. Legislative amendments passed Higgs highlighted the collaboration of all the political parties represented in the legislative assembly to pass legislation to protect New Brunswickers. Legislative amendments to the Emergency Measures Act were passed to ensure the government can continue to deliver enhanced measures to help contain the spread of COVID-19. One amendment provides authority to allow the government to quickly set up child-care centres for the children of essential service workers, if needed. These changes are necessary in areas where these workers have had difficulty in obtaining child care. Amendments were also made to the Employment Standards Act to address issues related to leaves of absences due to a state of emergency. “Together, the leaders of the four provincial parties represented in the legislative assembly and our municipal leaders need to forge a direction for this province,” Higgs said. “This will be very important moving forward. No matter which party comes into power in the future, there must be a road map for recovery, independent of partisan politics, and agreed upon by all.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   17-04-20"

We cannot take a break from these actions. They remain very important in protecting the health of all New Brunswickers.” Russell praised the work of Public Health teams that are engaged in contact-tracing to slow the spread of the virus. Community-based teams administered by the regional health authorities are working with the Department of Health to determine and limit the spread. Russell stressed that public co-operation is needed to ensure that contact tracing is effective. She urged New Brunswickers to closely follow directions from Public Health if they have been in contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. State of emergency extended to April 30 Premier Blaine Higgs announced that the declaration of emergency under the Emergency Measures Act was formally extended today. A state of emergency was declared on March 19, however such declarations expire after 14 days unless extended by the lieutenant-governor in council. Both cabinet and the all-party cabinet committee have approved the extension. “We will extend the declaration every 14 days until we are confident we do not need the emergency powers to impose restrictions to slow the spread of this infection,” said Higgs. Some parts of the emergency order have also been clarified to ensure that residents and business owners understand what they can and cannot do. For example, the government clarified that restaurants offering take-out must ensure physical distancing of customers who are on the premises waiting for their food, and that property owners must take steps to prevent gatherings. “We have been listening closely to the feedback of New Brunswickers throughout this evolving situation,” said Higgs. “We have received a number of requests for changes to the emergency order that could make life a little bit easier during these difficult times.  However, there are some requests that we still cannot accommodate because the goal of keeping New Brunswickers safe and healthy must remain our top priority.”   The latest version of the declaration is available online. Gardening and agricultural retailers to reopen Since gardening and agricultural retailers are an important part of the food supply, Higgs announced that this sector will be allowed to reopen starting today.       “In the weeks ahead, we will look for other adjustments,” said Higgs. “We are all keen to help our businesses recover, and we want New Brunswickers to begin to return to some of their normal activities.” Public drug plans Higgs addressed the issue of medical coverage under New Brunswick’s public drug plans. He said the government encourages all pharmacists to remove the extra dispensing and co-pay fees associated with the new limits of prescription refills.   More flexible rules for restaurant owners Higgs also announced that, for the duration of the state of emergency and at the request of restaurant owners, restaurants with a licence will be allowed to sell liquor off their menu for take-out or delivery. Owners will also need to ensure they do not sell liquor to minors.      Closed borders and cottage owners The government is asking non-residential cottage owners from outside the province to be patient and not to visit their cottage in the coming weeks. “I appreciate that some individuals have chosen to make New Brunswick their second home,” said Higgs. “But right now, due to the situation we are all in, I ask them to remain in their primary province of residence.

They can also monitor the latest lower Saint John River five-day forecast and the latest upper Saint John River five-day forecast. New Brunswickers are reminded to:  keep watercraft off rivers and avoid the banks of waterways as they become dangerous this time of year. The water is cold, and currents are swift and could be carrying debris;   be prepared for possible flooding and have a plan to evacuate and be self-sufficient for at least 72 hours;   move belongings to higher ground if their property is near a waterway or is in an area that is prone to flooding;   report ice jams or rising water.

But we must not get ahead of ourselves and we must continue to do all that we can to slow the spread of COVID-19.” Extra-Mural Program   The Extra-Mural Program provides a unique benefit to the province by offering at-home care to people who might otherwise require hospitalization. Russell said the program is taking steps to reduce the risk of spreading the virus through its work by providing care remotely, when possible, and screening patients and employees. “As with any other health-care setting, it is very important that you be truthful with Extra-Mural staff about any symptoms you may be experiencing,” said Russell. “They need to be ready if COVID-19 is potentially present in your home and to have the appropriate protective equipment when they visit.” Long-term care workers Premier Blaine Higgs said he will be exploring further an announcement by the federal government to supplement the salaries of essential workers, including those employed at long-term care facilities, who earn less than $2,500 per month.    “We have not received a lot of detail on how this program would work or how many – if any – New Brunswick workers will qualify,” said Higgs. “We believe that our front-line workers deserve all the support they can get, and I look forward to speaking with the other premiers, as well as the prime minister and the deputy prime minister, to learn more about this program.” Avoid flood-watching River Watch officials report that water levels have risen between Fredericton and Gagetown but, according to flooding forecasts, those levels should decrease in the coming days.   “We know people will be tempted to go get a closer look at the waterways, to see how high the levels are,” said Higgs. “Flood tourism is never a good idea, and this is especially true as we work to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that people who want to donate items such as masks, gowns, gloves, hand sanitizer and other personal protective equipment should contact Service New Brunswick, which manages government procurement. “While we have enough supplies in the health sector to meet the current demand, New Brunswickers have been calling the public health office asking how they can help those working in our hospitals, nursing homes and special care homes to stay safe,” said Russell. “These gestures of generosity are touching.” Donators will be asked to complete and submit a form detailing specific information on the manufacturer, specifications, and certifications (CSA etc.) of the material to be donated, so it can be determined if the material is free of contamination. If a donation is accepted, specific instructions for delivery will be provided. Physical distancing will be followed in the drop-off and delivery process.

Those who are exhibiting at least two of these symptoms are advised to immediately self-isolate and contact 811 or their family physician for further direction. Symptoms can range from relatively mild (runny nose and sore throat) to severe such as difficulty breathing. “Having two of these five symptoms does not mean that you have COVID-19,” said Russell. “But by isolating yourself quickly, you lessen the chance that the disease will spread to your family, neighbours and the wider community, if you are infected.” Two new cases Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified two new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 116.

These projections indicate that, with no public health measures, New Brunswick could have had up to 5,600 deaths over the course of the current outbreak. With the public health measures now in place – and adhered to by the public – the number of deaths could range from 550 to 1,750. “I want to do everything in my power to make sure we keep the numbers as low as possible,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “Together, we are already taking the steps to make the best-case scenario our reality.” While there have been no COVID-19 deaths in the province to date, Health Minister Hugh J. Flemming emphasized that the eventual number of deaths is entirely dependent on the efforts that all New Brunswickers take to slow the spread of the virus. “One death is one too many, but we must be realistic and expect that there will be deaths from COVID-19 in New Brunswick,” said Flemming. “Limiting the number of deaths requires that everyone follow the direction of the chief medical officer of health by staying home and maintaining physical distance from others when you have to go out.” The pandemic modelling was developed by staff from the Department of Health, Public Health and the regional health authorities. It was inspired by similar modelling released by the governments of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Quebec and Ontario. The models will be revised as new information is provided during the outbreak. Facts about the modelling:  The scenarios are based on the experience of northern Italy, as a case where a large impact has been experienced, and on all of Italy, as a medium-impact scenario.   The scenarios show potential outcomes up to April 30, beyond which projections become less reliable.   In the large-impact scenario, New Brunswick could experience up to 132 deaths by the end of April; under the medium-impact scenario, the figure is estimated at 70 deaths. On its current trajectory, with all public health measures now in place and adhered to by the public, New Brunswick could have 15 COVID-19 deaths by April 30.   The projected number of patients hospitalized on April 30, based on the current trajectory, is 28. That number could be as high as 125 under a large-impact scenario.   The number of patients requiring admission to an intensive care unit, currently projected to rise to 13 by the end of the month, could peak at 84 on April 30 under the large-impact scenario.  The province’s health system is preparing for any of these scenarios by securing personal protective equipment for health-care workers, pursuing expanded capacity for COVID-19 testing, and strengthening its ability to trace contacts and respond to potential clusters of the disease as quickly as possible. Three new cases Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified three new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 111. Of the 111 cases, 62 are travel-related, 33 are close contacts of confirmed cases, six are the result of community transmission and 10 remain under investigation. Ten people have been hospitalized and five have since been discharged. Four of the five patients remaining in hospital are in an intensive care unit. To date, 53 people have recovered. The new cases are:  An individual aged up to 10 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)   An individual aged 30-39 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)   An individual aged 40-49 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)  Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, directed New Brunswickers to continue to stay at home, practise physical distancing and maintain good hygiene practices to further slow the spread of the virus. “The message is simple: keep doing what you are doing,” said Russell. “We cannot afford to let up, even for a moment.” Applications for income benefit close at 8 p.m. More than 66,000 applicants have registered for the New Brunswick Workers Emergency Income Benefit. The one-time $900 benefit was created for workers or self-employed people who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 situation.

Applications close today at 8 p.m. and may be completed through the Red Cross, which is administering the program, at 1-800-863-6582. The applications will continue to be processed in the coming days. Recreational fishing and bear hunting seasons delayed The Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development has delayed, until at least May 1, the opening of all recreational fishing seasons and the spring bear hunting season due to COVID-19. Fishing season normally begins on April 15 and the spring bear hunt on April 20.  “As a government, we are committed to doing everything possible to protect our citizens,” said Higgs. “I am a fisherman and I love the outdoors. I know what this means, and I am hopeful conditions will change soon.”   This decision will be re-evaluated April 30. Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   09-04-20"

Environment and Climate Change Canada is forecasting between 15 to 25 centimetres of snow starting today through later in the day Friday, and rain next week from Monday through Tuesday. River Watch officials are watching closely for ice movement in the upper Saint John River basin which would increase the risk of ice jams. Ice jams have the potential to cause a rapid increase of water levels in affected areas. At the moment there are two minor ice jams, one near Sainte-Anne-de-Madawaska, on the Saint John River, and one at the mouth of Tobique River. Water levels remain below flood levels in all areas, but the situation could change quickly. Residents can report ice jams and localized flooding at any time by calling 1-800-561-4034. They can also monitor the latest lower Saint John River five-day forecast and the latest upper Saint John River five-day forecast. New Brunswickers are reminded to:  keep watercraft off rivers and avoid the banks of waterways as they become dangerous this time of year. The water is cold, and currents are swift and could be carrying debris;   be prepared for possible flooding and have a plan to evacuate and be self-sufficient for at least 72 hours;   move belongings to higher ground if their property is near a waterway or is in an area that is prone to flooding;   report ice jams or rising water. If you need advice, contact the Emergency Measures Organization at 1-800-561-4034; and   read helpful tips, the latest forecasts and public advisories by visiting the River Watch website, or by following the Emergency Measures Organization on Twitter and Facebook.  The River Watch program is in effect to provide New Brunswickers with information on the status of rivers, potential ice jams, and other flood issues across the province over the coming weeks. The program is a joint effort between the Department of Environment and Local Government and the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization of the Department of Public Safety. Other partners include NB Power, watershed groups, and federal, provincial and state agencies involved in monitoring and forecasting the water flow in the province's rivers and streams. Updates on information related to the potential for flooding or ice jams, including 24/7 emergency updates, is available online.   09-04-20"

Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified three new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 108. The new confirmed cases include the first recorded in Zone 6, the Acadie-Bathurst region. Of the 108 cases, 60 are travel-related, 33 are close contacts of confirmed cases, six are the result of community transmission and nine remain under investigation.

Clergy members can livestream a religious service, but individuals operating video equipment must maintain the physical distancing requirements of two metres. “With Easter weekend approaching, it is important to remember that in-person religious services in New Brunswick are prohibited,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “With your co-operation, we will make Easter and all religious observations as safe as possible for everyone.” Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, has directed New Brunswickers not to hold family gatherings, attend in-person religious services or hold recreational events over the Easter weekend, to avoid further spread of the COVID-19 virus. “The temptation to gather with friends and loved ones will be great this weekend,” said Russell. “You may think ‘it’s just my family’ or ‘it’s just my friends.’ But the COVID-19 virus may be an uninvited guest at your event, brought along by someone who has only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. Do not let that happen.” Buying essentials Residents are reminded that many retailers will be closed on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. Higgs encouraged people to make any essential purchases in advance, or plan to wait until next week, and to continue to observe restrictions and physical distancing requirements. “We are grateful for all the essential retail workers who continue to provide important services and necessities,” said Higgs. “For everyone’s safety, we ask that households choose one person to be the designated shopper, whenever possible.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   08-04-20"

However, an assessment is still required through 811 or an individual’s primary health-care provider.” Testing will continue to focus upon the protection of health-care workers, patients in hospitals and nursing homes, as well as first responders. Priority will also be given to testing those who may be more vulnerable to the disease, including people over 60 and people with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, or cancer.

When people go out, they should keep their interactions brief and maintain six feet of physical distance between themselves and others.” Loans for working capital now available Small, medium and large employers in New Brunswick whose businesses have been impacted by COVID-19 can now apply to the provincial government for loans for working capital. “We understand that this pandemic is impacting New Brunswick business,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “We acted swiftly to address the needs of the business community and support these employers during this challenging time.” The new loans are to support New Brunswick-based companies. A total of $50 million has been allocated for two distinct loan programs for working capital. Businesses can access more information about the application processes on a dedicated web page which features frequently asked questions and online resources.

We will have more cases. That is why we are doing everything we can to fight this.” He underlined the provincial government’s efforts, on the advice of Russell, to contain the spread of COVID-19 by making tough choices early on; to shut things down and restrict travel into the province while making sure essential services remained in place. Higgs also praised the leaders of the other political parties for their collaboration and engagement during this difficult time and noted how having an all-party cabinet committee has made a difference. “We are united in our mission,” said Higgs. “We have all put politics aside to make the tough decisions.

The funds will be distributed by post-secondary institutions based upon eligibility criteria and will provide a one-time amount of up to $750 per student. “The fund will support post-secondary students, including international students, who demonstrate a financial gap in meeting their basic needs between now and the end of the term,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. Students must contact their institution directly to be considered and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Funding support will be based upon the need for food, shelter, unanticipated medical costs not covered through health plans, and unforeseen additional academic costs. To qualify, vulnerable students must not qualify for the one-time $900 provincial emergency fund as of March 30. They must be in a position in which they cannot access money through student loans, Employment Insurance, personal savings, or other COVID-19 related financial assistance programs. Parks All provincial parks as well as playgrounds provincewide are closed. Higgs said today that if municipalities are going to keep their parks and trails open, they must have mechanisms in place to ensure that the limitations on the number of people that can gather is enforced. “Appropriate signage must be put up at access points to identify limitations on gatherings and the requirements for physical distancing,” said Higgs. “If a municipality cannot monitor usage of their premises, they should be closed.” Landlords and tenants Higgs clarified confusion that has arisen around the state of emergency and how it impacts tenants. The mandatory order under the Emergency Measures Act suspends the right for landlords to evict tenants for non-payment of rent, through to May 31. “People can still be evicted,” said Higgs. However, the reason for the eviction cannot be that they are unable to pay their rent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All other tenant obligations remain.” If somebody is unable to pay their rent, they must discuss the matter with their landlord and make the appropriate arrangements for payment.

Every dollar will make a difference during this crisis.” Seven locations across New Brunswick, in both regional health authorities, will have the capability to find out the results of COVID-19 tests faster. The sites will be in Edmundston, Campbellton, Bathurst, Miramichi, Moncton, Fredericton and Saint John.

Unless the situation drastically improves, schools will not be reopened to students and the school calendar will not be extended. “We understand families have been anxiously awaiting more information on how we will support students during this uncertain time,” said Education and Early Childhood Development Minister Dominic Cardy. “While our immediate concern continues to be public health and safety, we are committed to helping students continue their education while school facilities are closed. In response, we have developed a plan to continue to deliver education to students.” Anglophone and francophone sectors have each developed a delivery plan and supporting materials that reflect their unique approaches and correspond with their curricular outcomes. Students between kindergarten and Grade 12 will be asked to dedicate between an hour to two and a half hours a day to completing home learning options, depending upon their grade level. In addition, students of all ages are encouraged to read for a minimum of 30 minutes daily (as a family, aloud or silently depending upon grade level) and engage in 30 minutes of physical activity daily. “We understand each family has a different home environment,” said Cardy. “While parents will have a key responsibility to encourage students to complete the provided material and continue learning, it is important that families understand we are not asking them to recreate a classroom in their home or take on the full role of a teacher.” In the coming days, schools in both sectors will be in contact with families to share home learning options. Educational resources for students in the anglophone sector will also be shared on the newly-established New Brunswick Family Resources website. Francophone school districts are in the process of developing their own website and more information will be available in the coming days. Educators will be contacting families weekly and teachers will participate in the development of home learning options, as well as preparing for the eventual return of students to the classroom. Graduation and grade advancement All Grade 12 students who, as of January 2020, were on track to graduate in June 2020 will graduate on time and receive a New Brunswick high school diploma. Decisions on graduation ceremonies and other graduation events will be made in the coming weeks, based on direction from the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. The government will work with post-secondary institutions to ensure this crisis does not prevent students from being eligible for admission to post-secondary studies in the upcoming school year.

Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified 11 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 81. Out of the 81 cases, 43 are travel-related, 22 are close contacts of confirmed cases, three cases are from community transmission and 13 cases remain under investigation. Fourteen people have since recovered from the virus and four people are in hospital, including two of the latest cases. The new cases are:  An individual aged 20-29 in Zone 1 (Moncton region) An individual aged 50-59 in Zone 1 (Moncton region) An individual aged 40-49 in Zone 2 (Saint John region) An individual aged 60-69 in Zone 2 (Saint John region) An individual aged 50-59 in Zone 2 (Saint John region) An individual aged 30-39 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region) An individual aged 40-49 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region) An individual aged 50-59 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region) An individual aged 50-59 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region) An individual aged 50-59 in Zone 5 (Campbellton region) An individual aged 60-69 in Zone 5 (Campbellton region)  Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it becomes increasingly important that we protect those who are protecting us. “Doctors, nurses, paramedics, lab technicians and a host of other health-care workers are working hard every day to protect us against the spread of this virus and provide care to those who become ill because of it,” said Russell. “They are putting themselves in harm’s way for all of us and they deserve our profound gratitude.” State of emergency enforcement The all-party cabinet committee on COVID-19 and the cabinet have agreed to extend the state of emergency declaration issued March 19 for another 14 days. The order will be reassessed after two weeks and will be extended as needed. Premier Blaine Higgs stressed that failing to obey the emergency order has serious consequences, with fines ranging from $292.50 to $10,200. “Most New Brunswickers understand that we are under a state of emergency and have been acting appropriately,” said Higgs. “But we are still seeing reports of people who are not taking the situation seriously. We need these people to understand that violating an order is against the law.” Personal protection equipment (PPE) for health-care workers Higgs said he was pleased to hear the federal government will invest $2 billion to produce necessary supplies, including ventilators, testing kits and personal protective equipment such as masks, face shields, gowns and hand sanitizer. “We will continue to work closely with the federal government and the other provinces to ensure we have access to these supplies in New Brunswick as the demand increases,” said Higgs. Russell urged the public not to obtain or use supplies made for the health-care sector. “I am confident we have the medical supplies we need to meet the current demands of this pandemic,” said Russell. “But we cannot afford to waste our resources. We must maintain our supplies and use them appropriately.” Flatten the curve Higgs repeated calls for everyone to do their part to protect all New Brunswickers. “Since this pandemic began, we have all been asked to make sacrifices,” said Higgs. “We need all of you to do your part. We need you to continue to stay at home and keep a safe physical distance from other people. We need you to help us flatten the curve.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   01-04-20"

It will then be released to the public. Local businesses Higgs encouraged business owners affected by the state of emergency to use existing supports to keep operating and to think long term. “Use any financial assistance you receive to stay afloat, but keep employees working and look to the future,” said Higgs. “Now is the time to be innovative.

Two new cases have been confirmed, bringing the total number of cases to 68; two of those people have since fully recovered. The new confirmed cases are:  an individual aged 30-40 in Zone 2 (Saint John region)   an individual aged 60-70 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)  Public Health is advising people who visited Shoppers Drug Mart at 175 Old Hampton Rd. in Quispamsis on the dates below that they were potentially exposed to COVID-19:  March 18 – 3:30 p.m. to midnight   March 19 – 11:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.   March 26 – 8:15 a.m. to 11:45 a.m.  In addition, individuals who visited Shoppers Drug Mart at 57 Lansdowne Ave. in Saint John on the date below were potentially exposed to COVID-19:  March 20 – 10 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.  Anyone who was in those stores during those times should self-monitor and call 811 if they have any symptoms. Dr. Jennifer Russell, the province’s chief medical officer of health, confirmed that incidents of community transmission are now present in New Brunswick; these are cases that cannot be directly traced back to an infection which took place outside the province. There are confirmed cases of community transmission in zones 1 (Moncton region), 2 (Saint John region) and 4 (Edmundston region). There are additional cases being investigated in other regions. “This follows the trend we have seen in other parts of Canada. We have been expecting this and preparing for it,” said Russell. “People everywhere in New Brunswick have to act as if the virus is in their community whether it is confirmed or not.” Russell said the potential for community transmission was the reason the province took proactive measures, such as directing people to stay at home, asking people to maintain physical distancing with others, limiting travel, and cancelling events where crowds may gather. These actions will limit the spread of the virus and the disease it carries, said Russell. With community transmission now a reality, Russell said further changes are being made to the province’s testing protocols to ensure protection for those in greatest need. Testing will now focus on:  symptomatic health-care workers and staff of long-term care facilities and prisons   hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms and no alternative diagnosis   residents of long-term care facilities and other vulnerable communities  Symptomatic travellers from outside New Brunswick will continue to be tested. Russell emphasized the continued importance of New Brunswickers being on alert for COVID-19 symptoms – a new or exacerbation of a chronic cough or a fever – among themselves and their families. People should use the self-assessment tool at the www.gnb.ca website for guidance and contact 811 if they have symptoms. “If you have the symptoms of COVID-19, you must act as if you have COVID-19,” said Russell. “That means isolating yourself immediately for at least 14 days. Do not put others at risk by behaving as if you do not have this disease. “More than ever, what you do matters. What each of us does matters. It remains within our capability to slow the progress and limit the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak.” Entering the third week of emergency Premier Blaine Higgs thanked all New Brunswickers for their quick action and innovation to address the pandemic. Higgs said the government made difficult decisions early to flatten the curve and reduce the spread of COVID-19 by closing schools, government offices, businesses and all non-essential services. Higgs said he anticipates these decisions will have a positive effect in the days and weeks ahead.    “Taking action before we were experiencing the full impact of the pandemic may have seemed extreme at the time, but I am confident it was the right thing to do,” said Higgs.  “We took these actions earlier than some jurisdictions because we saw what happened all around the world in places that waited too long to react.” Emphasis on physical distancing New Brunswickers are being reminded of the importance of physical distancing and self-isolation, particularly following stories in the media over the past week about people engaging in unacceptable behaviour that puts residents, essential workers and first responders in danger. “The more successful we are at flattening the curve now, the quicker we can all get back to our regular lives,” said Higgs. “Many people and businesses have taken this situation seriously from the beginning, and they have done their part to help keep us all safe. We have to continue to do our part by staying at home and maintaining physical distance from others. There are still people disobeying the emergency order and putting us all at risk.” New Brunswick Workers Emergency Income Benefit Applications are now available for the $900 income benefit for workers or self-employed people in New Brunswick who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 situation.

This includes employees of regional health authorities, long-term care facilities, the Extra-Mural program, First Nation communities; Ambulance New Brunswick, community physicians and pharmacists. Health-care workers who are self-employed or employed by other organizations and who have developed COVID-19 symptoms since March 20, are also directed to immediately self-isolate.

They should not call the toll-free number designated for health-care workers. The toll-free line is also not for employees who have questions regarding pay, entitlements, or other concerns. In view of the good weather this weekend, Russell suggested people enjoy the outdoors while practising physical distancing. Food production Agriculture, aquaculture, fishing and processing operations are essential services and are permitted to continue; however, workplaces must take measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. “I thank New Brunswick’s farmers, harvesters, aquaculturists and processors for their dedication in providing high-quality and safe products to families across the province in these critical times,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “They play an important role in keeping New Brunswickers healthy. We will continue to work with these sectors to address challenges as they arise.” In addition to operating loans for small businesses announced by the provincial government, the federal government announced earlier this week that it has enhanced Farm Credit Canada’s lending capacity by an additional $5 billion to ensure producers, agribusinesses and food processors continue to have access to capital.

Businesses Employers are reminded of their duty to comply with the measures in the state of emergency declaration. For the safety of employees and customers, businesses that are allowed to be open must limit the number of customers on their premises to maintain physical distancing rules and must check that customers entering are not among those required to be in self-isolation. Failing to comply could result in enforcement by the Department of Public Safety or a stop-work order by WorkSafeNB. Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online. 27-03-20"

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, emphasized the rapidly changing nature and course of the pandemic, and said New Brunswick’s public health strategies are shifting to meet this challenge. “By practicing physical distancing, we are depriving the virus of the opportunity to spread more widely,” Russell said. “By doing this, we are improving our chances of lessening the severity of this outbreak.” Premier Blaine Higgs outlined economic support measures to help alleviate financial pressures faced by residents and business owners. “We are facing a situation unlike anything we have experienced before, and we are acting swiftly to help families with their immediate needs and to bridge the financial gap for employers,” said Higgs. “While the federal government has announced comprehensive measures to support employers, gaps exist in the immediate term for businesses to access the working capital needed to address cash-flow shortages.” To provide emergency-income benefits to the estimated 25,000 to 35,000 New Brunswickers who have found themselves suddenly unemployed, the provincial government will assist in the following ways:  Income support for workers          Announced earlier this week, this will be a $4.5 million investment for workers who have recently become unemployed. The benefit will help to bridge the gap between when a person lost their job or closed their business after March 15, to when the national benefit takes effect. The objective will be to provide access to the benefit before the end of March. The benefit will end on April 30.  Job protection for workers          Legislative and regulatory amendments will be introduced to provide job protection for workers who must take a leave of absence due to COVID-19. It will allow an unpaid leave of up to 15 weeks to New Brunswickers who have COVID-19 or are caring for someone with the virus.    To support the province’s economy, keep workers employed, and help businesses continue to operate, a total of $50 million in assistance is being made available, including:    Elimination of interest on WorkSafeNB assessment premiums          WorkSafeNB is deferring the collection of assessment premiums for three months. The current interest rate is prime plus three per cent. The rate will be reduced to zero per cent to align with the three-month deferral.  Deferring interest and principal payments on existing Government of New Brunswick loans          On a case-by-case basis, the provincial government will defer loan and interest repayments for existing business loans with government departments for up to six months. Businesses can request deferrals by contacting the department that issued the loan.  Up to $25 million in working capital for New Brunswick small business owners          Small business owners will be eligible for loans up to $200,000. They will not be required to pay principal on their loan for up to 12 months.  Up to $25 million in working capital for medium-sized to large employers          The province will provide working capital of more than $200,000 to help medium-sized to large employers manage the effects of COVID-19 on their operations. Businesses can apply directly to Opportunities NB for this support.  Information about the assistance for business is available online and application details will be made available in the coming days. “We will continue to closely monitor and assess the economic situation,” said Higgs. “If additional actions are required in the future, we will respond accordingly.” Interprovincial border restrictions Higgs welcomed the co-operation of travellers being screened upon entering New Brunswick. Since the restrictions went into effect yesterday, peace officers have been collecting contact information of travellers and details about their intended destinations. “I am very encouraged by how people have reacted to the entry changes at border crossings,” said Higgs. “We know this is an inconvenience, but these measures are essential to protecting New Brunswickers. Everyone’s continued co-operation is appreciated.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   26-03-20"

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, reassured New Brunswickers that testing is adequate, efficient and increasing to meet the ever-changing shape of the current pandemic. The province has conducted more than 1,700 tests and 1.7 per cent have been confirmed cases. The microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton, where all the province’s COVID-19 testing is being administered, is meeting the existing and anticipated demand. “We have the capacity to conduct 600 tests per day,” said Russell. “Soon we will be able to process 1,000 tests every day.” Beginning today, restrictions will be implemented for all travellers arriving in New Brunswick from outside the province. Interprovincial travellers, like international travellers, will need to self-isolate for 14 days. All unnecessary travel into New Brunswick is prohibited, and peace officers are authorized to turn away visitors when they attempt to enter. “We must do all we can to prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in New Brunswick,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “We are implementing screening at interprovincial borders. Regardless of where you are, we urge you to avoid any non-essential travel.” Travellers entering the province from Quebec, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia will be stopped by peace officers and required to produce identification. Contact information and intended destinations are being collected and tracked for all travellers, including those travelling through New Brunswick to another province. Like measures at the Canada-United States border, commercial traffic and essential employees will be exempt so that services are maintained and critical supplies can continue to move across provincial boundaries unimpeded. Police officers, firefighters, paramedics and members of the military will also be exempt from these measures. Help line established to assist people in self-isolation The provincial government has partnered with the Canadian Red Cross to support New Brunswickers affected by the requirement to self-isolate. This service is available to all residents and visitors. The Canadian Red Cross can assist people in accessing a wide range of supports and services.

The laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton is now able to give final confirmation of any tests completed in New Brunswick, without the necessity of sending them to the national laboratory in Winnipeg. The new case is a female, between the ages of 20 and 30, in zone 1 (southeast) who had recently travelled. Two of the 18 cases have required hospitalization. These include a case in zone 2 (southern New Brunswick) who was hospitalized briefly and has been discharged and a case in zone 3 (central New Brunswick) whose condition is being evaluated. New Brunswick has not yet seen cases of community transmission, in which a case emerges with no clear link to a known source of infection. However, Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said the province must be ready for this. “We are working to increase the pace of COVID-19 testing, to effectively identify those who may have the disease, those who have been in contact with suspected cases, and those who are most vulnerable to its effects,” said Russell. Premier Blaine Higgs and his fellow premiers spoke last night with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. One of the topics of discussion was interprovincial borders. “We need a national plan that addresses travel between provinces,” said Higgs. “We are seeing new measures being put in place each day, and these measures can vary widely between provinces and territories. Enacting a national state of emergency is the best tool to ensure consistency across our country in the level of health care, safeguarding our supply chain, and mitigating the economic impact.” The provincial government will provide a one-time income benefit to either workers or self-employed people in New Brunswick who have lost their job due to the state of emergency. This one-time $900 benefit will be administered through the Red Cross and will help to bridge the time between when people lose their employment or close their business and to when they receive their federal benefit.

Currently, New Brunswick has 17 cases. All cases are related to international travel or to a confirmed case that has travelled outside the province. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, thanked New Brunswickers for their continuing efforts to reduce the spread of the disease and noted the many sacrifices being made to slow the progress of the disease. She also saluted the efforts of health-care professionals and others working in the health-care system. “We have to protect our health-care workers, so they can carry on with this important work,” said Dr. Russell. “When we take actions to limit the spread of this disease, among those we are protecting are the front-line workers that are so valuable in this situation. When you stay home and practice social distancing, you are not only protecting yourselves, you are protecting the people who may soon be saving your life.” Russell also announced that the laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton is now able to give final confirmation of any tests completed in New Brunswick, without the necessity of sending them to the national laboratory in Winnipeg. This will speed up the testing and confirmation process in the province. After the remaining tests that were already submitted are returned, the province will be announcing positive and negative test results without the need for a presumptive category. “It is also important that we track those who have been in contact with others who have since become infected,” said Russell. “A case from Prince Edward Island has implications for New Brunswick. The patient was showing symptoms on March 16 when they travelled from Toronto to Moncton on WestJet flight 3456. We are confident that PEI’s public health has undertaken appropriate contact tracing but want to reiterate that anyone who travelled on that flight must immediately go into self-isolation for 14 days.” Premier Blaine Higgs thanked businesses that are complying with the emergency declaration and mandatory order for prioritizing the health and safety of their employees, customers and all New Brunswickers. “The Department of Public Safety has been checking businesses across the province and has found 94 per cent of them are in compliance,” said Higgs. “No one wants to make this a law enforcement matter with charges and fines, but we are ready to do what is needed for everyone to comply,” said Higgs. “We are especially concerned with businesses operating despite the order and with individuals who are required to self-isolate who are not doing it. We are not asking you to do this lightly. We know it impacts your business. But it is imperative that non-essential businesses comply if we are going to flatten the curve.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online. Other information related to the response to the virus includes: Information line and email A toll-free information line and email address, which offers services in both languages, has been set up to help answer non-health related questions, including questions about compliance with the state of emergency.

There are still 17 cases in New Brunswick: eight confirmed and nine presumptive. So far there have been 865 tests conducted in the province. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, reminds New Brunswickers to stay home and engage in proper social distancing practices to help slow the spread of COVID-19. “All of us can take simple actions that can help stop the spread of any type of communicable disease,” said Russell. “Regular hand washing, coughing or sneezing into your elbow, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth, practice social distancing by maintaining two-metres from others and staying home (self-isolating) when you are sick can greatly reduce the risk of infection spreading.” To limit the spread of COVID-19, all non-essential travel between Canada and the United States is restricted, until further notice. People who are returning to New Brunswick from international travel are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days. This means they must not make any stops, including at the grocery store or pharmacy. They must go directly home and connect with a relative, friend or volunteer to help them with any required errands. Many New Brunswickers are returning from a lengthy stay in the southern United States or elsewhere. Over the 14 days they need to monitor themselves and their families closely for symptoms, which include a fever, or cough or difficulty breathing. Anyone with those symptoms can:  use the Government of New Brunswick’s online self-assessment tool at www.gnb.ca/coronavirus;   make a virtual appointment with their primary care provider; or;   call Tele-Care at 8-1-1 to speak with a registered nurse.  It is imperative that people remain home, self-isolating until directed otherwise by a health professional. Everyone entering New Brunswick from outside Canada will be given a brochure explaining all the measures associated with COVID-19 and the State of Emergency. The objective is to ensure appropriate actions are taken to address the pandemic. The provincial government will have a phone line available on Monday, March 23, which New Brunswickers can call if they have concerns about people not complying with the state of emergency orders. In the meantime, concerned individuals can remind returning travellers of their responsibility to do their part to keep everyone safe by staying in their homes. All residents, including those who have travelled and those who have not, are reminded to follow the guidelines laid out in the orders. Russell is encouraging people to look after themselves and others, both physically and mentally. “I encourage everyone to take the opportunity to get outdoors and enjoy the fresh air,” said Russell. “Several things are closed but the outdoors is not one of them! There are many activities that you and your family can do outside that still respect social distancing practices. Go for a walk or hike, do yoga in the backyard or look for signs of spring.” Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online.   22-03-20"

Testing has identified six new presumptive cases and confirmed two previous presumptive cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in New Brunswick to 17: eight confirmed and nine presumptive. There have been 771 tests administered to date in the province. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, continues to urge people to stay home, maintain social distance and wash their hands frequently. “It is critical that everyone do their part to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Russell. “This can and will save lives.” Premier Blaine Higgs acknowledged that the increase in cases is not surprising. “Based on what we have seen in other jurisdictions, we know that the numbers will continue to rise,” said Higgs. “We have put measures in place here in New Brunswick to try to slow down the rising number of cases. With our province under a state of emergency, I am imploring people to continue to take this situation seriously.” The six new cases are:  a male, between 40 and 50, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise; a female, between 50 and 60 in zone 3 (central), who is a direct contact of a previously identified presumptive case; a female, between 40 and 50, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise; a male, between 60 and 70, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise; a female, between 50 and 60, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise; and a female, between 20 and 30, in zone 2 (south), who is a close contact to a travel-related presumptive case.  Additional testing to confirm the cases will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. A new online self-assessment tool is now in use and Russell is pleased with the public response. “Yesterday, almost 5,500 individuals used the self-assessment tool,” said Russell. “This has led to a reduction in the number of calls to the 811 line, which has allowed our health-care professionals to assist callers more promptly.” Effective immediately, and for the duration of the emergency, patients with drug coverage under New Brunswick’s public drug plans will only be responsible for the initial co-payment on a prescription fill or refill. For example, a patient with a 90-day prescription will only have a co-payment for the first 30-day fill. There will be no co-payment required for the second and third 30-day fills on the same 90-day prescription. This applies to all New Brunswickers that are on the public drug plan, including many seniors and low-income individuals. Among the steps being taken to address the pandemic is closing off non-essential travel between Canada and the United States, effective today. “I want New Brunswickers to know government is doing its part to make sure returning travellers know what is expected of them,” said Higgs. The premier added that travellers with symptoms are not being allowed to board airplanes. Everyone who arrives, by air or by land, is being screened at the border. If they have symptoms, they will be separated from others and Public Health will conduct isolation and testing. If they do not have symptoms, they will receive detailed information on what is expected of them. As well, all travellers must isolate themselves for 14 days after returning home. Anyone transporting these travellers from the airport, or those who mingle with them in other ways, must also self-isolate. Up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available online. 21-03-20"

Using this tool will help New Brunswickers determine when they should call the 811 line, which will reduce the volume of calls we have seen from people seeking basic information. Maintaining our blood supply is vital to our health-care system in ordinary circumstances, and these are not ordinary circumstances. Canada Blood Services has alerted us to an urgent need for new donations to maintain supply. Additional screening and social distancing measures are in place, and it is safe to donate blood. This is an important way to make a difference at this critical time. No new presumptive cases of COVID-19 were reported in the province today. There are still 11 cases in New Brunswick: seven confirmed and four presumptive. Premier Blaine Higgs acknowledged front-line workers who are vital to the province’s supply chain and continue to do their jobs during these challenging times. “Right now, across this province, people are working hard to ensure that our lives function in as normal a manner as is possible,” said Higgs. “I want to take a moment to thank all of these dedicated workers on behalf of all New Brunswickers. It is not easy to go to work when many are being told to stay home. I appreciate that you continue to do so.” Other information related to the response to the virus includes: Travellers Canadians returning home from other countries must self-isolate for 14 days. If they are returning by air, they should arrange to have a family member drop off a vehicle at the airport if possible. They must not go to the grocery store when they return, but instead arrange to have someone pick up groceries before they arrive home – and continue to do so during the 14 days of isolation. Employers and employees Employers and employees have responsibilities under the state of emergency. Health and safety at work is especially important in these times. Employers need to take precautionary measures to reduce the level of exposure: practice good workplace hygiene; and allow workers to work remotely if possible. In addition to the recommendations put in place, Public Health is preparing a questionnaire that employers can use to screen workers, customers and other members of the public before they enter. Anyone with questions or concerns about employers who are not complying with these recommendations should contact WorkSafeNB. Business Declaring a state of emergency in our province has resulted in a lot of calls about what can stay open and what must close. Businesses that are open must take precautions to keep their workers safe. This includes social distancing, providing a clean working environment, and any other precautions needed to keep workers healthy and safe. An interpretative guideline to provide clarification of the Declaration of a State of Emergency and Mandatory Order and how it is applied to various businesses and functions is available online. Businesses with questions should contact: nav@navnb.ca, call the Business Navigator line at 1-833-799-7966, or consult the COVID-19 page specifically for businesses. WorkSafeNB WorkSafeNB is deferring premiums for businesses for three months. Business property taxes Though business property taxes must be paid by May 31, late penalties will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to see if the penalty can be waived due to undue financial challenges, such as having to close a business due to COVID-19. Critical sector adjustment committees The Department of Post-secondary Education, Training and Labour is creating critical sector adjustment committees to help minimize the impact felt by any closures and is working with companies to mitigate impacts felt in affected regions of the province. Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency The province is working with the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency to come up with a comprehensive plan to ensure any issues businesses may face during this time are addressed. Service New Brunswick Service New Brunswick provides more than 400 services to the public on behalf of other government departments and agencies.

This includes those paying to reserve a space at their usual child care facility but whose child is attending one of the emergency child care facilities. In this situation, the department will cover the costs of emergency child care. Parents should notify the department to ensure they are not double-billed. This also means that parents must continue to pay to hold their space at a centre that has not laid off its staff. “We understand this is difficult for many New Brunswickers,” said Cardy. “Paying for a service you do not use on a snow day is one thing but paying for weeks or months is another. Our department’s immediate focus has been ensuring essential needs are met. In the coming weeks, we will continue to explore how we can address identified gaps.” Information for essential service workers will be available through the department’s parent portal or by calling 1-833-221-9339. The directive that people who have travelled internationally on or after March 9 still applies, and travellers are to avoid early learning and child care centres for 14 days. 20-03-20"

Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries Minister Ross Wetmore; Prince Edward Island Fisheries and Communities Minister Jamie Fox; Newfoundland and Labrador Fisheries and Land Resources Minister Gerry Byrne; and Nova Scotia Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Keith Colwell spoke on Wednesday, March 18, and agreed to hold regular conference calls until the period of concern over COVID-19 has subsided. “It is imperative that we work together to support Atlantic Canada’s seafood industry in these difficult times,” said Wetmore. “Our harvesters, aquaculture producers and seafood processors have always been ready to adapt to maintain their livelihood for current and future generations, and this is no exception. We will continue to focus efforts to support this resilient industry and to ensure it remains a sustainable way of life for rural, coastal and Aboriginal communities.” All four ministers underlined the economic importance of the fishing and aquaculture sectors to their respective provinces. The two sectors provide billions of dollars and thousands of jobs to the region. They also discussed the close relationship between the four Atlantic provinces and agreed to work with the federal government to find mechanisms to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on the two sectors.   19-03-20"

Schools, colleges, universities and private schools must be closed to students. Institutions which have students in residence are permitted to allow them to remain in residence until they can safely return home. Online course delivery may continue.  The premier reiterated that construction activities continue and that they are not prohibited under this declaration. Other measures under the declaration of state of emergency include:  All businesses in retail sales will stop admitting patrons, except: grocery stores; pharmacies; repair garages; post offices; financial and lending institutions; retailers of fuel, hardware and automotive parts; convenience stores; animal and fish feed providers; and corporate and agency stores of NB Liquor and Cannabis NB.

Every person directed by a physician to self-isolate will obey. Every person who has been outside Canada will self-isolate within their home for 14 days after their return to Canada, and, if they experience symptoms of COVID-19 during that period, will remain self-isolated until they are free of symptoms. This requirement does not apply to people exempted by the chief medical officer of health. Owners and operators of all other premises at which people may gather in large numbers will take all reasonable steps to prevent gatherings of more than 10 people. All regulated health services providers will cease operations unless the services to be provided are to address essential health care or an emergency health-care situation. All unregulated health services providers, with the exception of those that are providing direct support to regulated health services providers, shall cease operations immediately. Owners and managers of all workplaces and organizers of all activities will take every reasonable step to ensure minimal interaction of people within 2 metres of each other and carry out advice to minimize risk as issued by the chief medical officer of health. All owners and managers of all workplaces will reduce to critical functions and will take every reasonable step required to prevent people who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 from entering the workplace, in accordance with advice issued by the chief medical officer of health or Worksafe New Brunswick. They will also take every reasonable step required to prevent people from entering workplaces who have travelled internationally in the previous 14 days.

The right of landlords under section 19 of the Residential Tenancies Act to require tenants to vacate for non-payment of rent, and the authority of residential tenancies officers under section 22 of that act to evict tenants for the same reason, are suspended, until May 31, 2020.  The declaration is available online. “This declaration provides us with the tools we need to ensure the safety of New Brunswickers. This is not a decision we took lightly,” said Higgs. “We are confident that these measures will result in New Brunswickers taking the necessary actions.” No new presumptive cases of COVID-19 were reported in the province today. There are still 11 cases in New Brunswick: seven confirmed; and four presumptive. “Although we have no new cases today, we know there will be more cases of COVID-19,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. 19-03-20"

It is natural to feel distress, anxiety, grief, and worry during and after a stressful situation.” Russell said there are actions individuals can take to support themselves and their families:  Connect with others while maintaining safe social distancing - Share your concerns and how you are feeling with a friend or family member. Check-in regularly with loved ones, especially those affected by the virus.   Take breaks - Take deep breaths, stretch or meditate. Make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade. Try to do activities you usually enjoy. Maintain a sense of hope and think positively.   Get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well.  Testing has identified three additional presumptive cases of COVID-19, bringing the number of presumptive or positive cases in New Brunswick to 11. The three new cases are:  a female, between 60 and 70, in zone 1 (southeast) who had been on a cruise;   a male, between 60 and 70, in zone 3 (central) who had been in contact with an individual who had direct contact with a traveller; and   a female, between 50 and 60, in zone 3 (central) who had travelled to the United Kingdom.  Additional testing to confirm the cases will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. Premier Blaine Higgs implored New Brunswickers to heed recommendations from Dr. Russell and the Public Health team. “People should stay home whenever possible, I cannot stress that enough,” said Higgs. “No play dates; no sleepovers; family visits only when required. Enjoy the fresh air, but avoid doing it in groups, and keep six feet away from others when you absolutely need to go somewhere.” Higgs said these measures are designed to flatten the curve and reduce the impact of the virus. He also thanked New Brunswickers who continue to provide essential services. “There are those on the front lines of our health-care system, but there are also people like the truck drivers who are making sure goods get to our stores, the staff working in those stores and keeping the shelves stocked, and the people working behind the scenes every day to enable us to continue to get these important updates to you,” he said. “They are leaving their families at home and in service to the greater good. We need to do what we can to help them stay healthy and safe, and that means we must stay at home as much as possible.” Higgs stressed the importance of following the advice of health professionals to protect New Brunswickers, especially the more vulnerable residents. He warned that if people do not act as advised, additional measures may need to be taken to ensure that everyone follows the Public Health recommendations. Other information related to the response to the virus includes: Pharmacies Pharmacists are considering the long-term needs of New Brunswickers and wish to ensure that medications are dispensed responsibly during this uncertain time. Providing patients with a 30-day supply of medication will help them continue to ensure a stable supply for patients. Requesting early refills unless absolutely necessary or stockpiling medications could create unintended drug shortages and put the health of other patients at risk. In order to help keep pharmacists and their staff healthy, New Brunswickers are asked not to go to any pharmacy if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, new onset of cough or difficulty breathing), in the 14 days after the onset of symptoms or if they think they have been exposed to the virus. Food Security The Department of Social Development is in constant contact with food banks, soup kitchens, agencies such as Meals on Wheels and similar organizations, to ensure the continued provision of services. If volunteers are needed, many civil servants are available and have offered to help. If these organizations experience an influx of new clients, the department will provide additional financial support. Shelters for the homeless The Department of Social Development is working closely with shelters for the homeless to encourage best practices in preventing the onset and spread of the virus. The shelters are reinforcing safe hygiene practices, including constant handwashing, among the clients and staff are cleaning the shelters thoroughly. Most shelters are operating at or near capacity, but plans are being finalized to provide temporary separate accommodations in the event a shelter client becomes ill with COVID 19. Canadian Red Cross As part of its efforts to encourage social distancing and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the Canadian Red Cross will close its offices and branches to the public by the end of day, March 18. Regarding the Health Equipment Loan Program, delivery services are by appointment only between 9 a.m. and noon, if absolutely necessary. New Brunswick courts New Brunswick courts are closed to the public except for those people necessary to the proceedings including counsel, litigants, accused, witnesses, victim service workers and members of the media. No one who is experiencing any COVID-19 related symptoms should attend. Information related to the courts is available online. Businesses Information specific to businesses is available online and will be updated as more information becomes available. Businesses impacted by sudden shifts in the economy are encouraged you to get in touch with their local Opportunities NB office, or by emailing info@onbcanada.ca. Daycares Higgs said parents will not be charged while daycares are closed to their children and said essential service workers, whose children are at daycares, will continue to pay their regular rate. “We are asking daycare operators not to increase their usual rates at this time,” he said. “Today the federal government announced relief for small businesses. We are working to determine how this applies to daycares, but we are committed to closing the gaps.” Federal government initiatives Higgs noted the federal government today announced a new set of economic measures to help stabilize the economy. “These measures will provide up to $27 billion in direct support to Canadian workers and businesses,” he said. “As this was just announced, we need to determine the role New Brunswick will play in this. As we learn more, we will share the information.” Higgs said he was pleased that Canada and the United States have agreed to collaborate on mutually restricting discretionary travel across the border. “I was relieved to hear during a call with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and all the premiers, that this will not impact essential travel and trade, including trucking,” he said. “Specifically, we were given assurances that they are making progress to find a way to minimize the impact on Campobello Island.” 18-03-20"

An Act Respecting Elections in 2020 received royal assent after first, second and third readings all occurred in one day. “With the large number of electors, polling stations and poll workers, there was no safe way to undertake the municipal election at this time,” said Kim Poffenroth, New Brunswick’s Chief Electoral Officer. “Elections are contact-heavy events and with the guidance of the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s directive on public gatherings and social distancing, it was felt to be the only option at this time.” The legislation also includes district education council, regional health authority and local service district elections as well as a plebiscite in Saint-Quentin. The legislation also postpones the two provincial byelections, currently scheduled for June 15, 2020. The byelections would have to be held no later than 30 days prior to the day that the legislature begins a new session in the fall as long as it is safe to do so. “Everyone has a role to play in mitigating the impact of COVID-19,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, the province’s chief medical officer of health. “Mass gatherings can have the potential for serious public health consequences if they are not planned and managed carefully. They can increase the spread of infectious diseases and cause additional strain on the health-care system when held during outbreaks.” With the municipal budget cycle being organized on the calendar year, an election in the fall would impact the ability of local governments to prepare and pass their budgets. Subsequently, elections are expected to be held in May 2021 or sooner depending upon how quickly the outbreak subsides. 17-03-20"

Staying home will reduce direct contact with New Brunswickers. Everyone has a responsibility to stay home and go out only for essentials. In an effort to allow 811 health-care professionals to support more people who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, the Department of Health has authorized physicians to see their patients “virtually” for routine services such as prescription renewals and providing follow-up health advice. You can receive care and advice over the phone, or if available to you, via secure video chat software. These provisions have also just been authorized for psychiatrists for the provision of mental health-care services. These measures will enable New Brunswickers to maintain social distance and still get the care they need. More importantly, these measures will better enable our health-care professionals to focus on meeting the needs of the most urgent cases and minimize in-person contact in an environment where the risk of passing on infection may be high. Testing has identified one additional presumptive case of COVID-19, bringing the number of presumptive or positive cases in New Brunswick to eight. The case is a male, under 10 years of age in zone 3 (in the central part of the province). The patient is a close contact to a confirmed travel-related case. Additional testing to confirm the cases as positive COVID-19 cases will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. The provincial government has taken a number of steps to address the impact of COVID-19. As of today, only those public-sector workers who work in critical functions or areas that support critical functions will remain on the job. Other changes include: Nursing Homes Premier Blaine Higgs reminded New Brunswickers visitation is restricted at nursing homes and hospitals in order to protect people over the age of 70 who are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. Starting today, the Department of Social Development is introducing an urgent nursing home placement process to move 65 individuals currently in hospital beds receiving alternative levels of care into nursing homes around the province. These people will be moved into a nursing home that provides services in their language of choice within 100 kilometres of their permanent address. Doing this will enhance the well-being of seniors who require 24-hour nursing care while freeing up dozens of hospital beds. This will allow for more capacity in our health-care system to address the needs of people facing serious illness. Legislature Today, the legislative assembly sat with a quorum of 15 members. All the parties worked together to pass numerous pieces of legislation, including the legislation to postpone the municipal elections planned for May. This legislation will also make it possible to postpone the provincial byelections if that becomes necessary. A decision was also made today that the house is going to rise until further notice. This will help reduce interactions among members of the legislative assembly. The government is leading by example to highlight the importance of social distancing. Businesses Some businesses have had to temporarily close to help slow the spread of the virus, but Higgs reassured New Brunswickers that grocery stores and pharmacies have access to supplies and will stay open. Higgs congratulated the businesses that are not just staying open and that are making accommodations to make life easier for the most vulnerable residents by setting aside specific times for seniors and persons with disabilities to shop. Higgs called on banks to consider what they can do to help small local businesses stay afloat, and he is working directly with the federal government to ensure there is a coordinated approach to assist small businesses and individuals who need help. Correctional Services In an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in correctional institutions, the province has closed public access to these facilities effective immediately. The restriction includes all members of the public, including inmate family members, volunteers and legal representatives. These measures include all facilities in the province: Southeast Regional Correctional Centre; Saint John Regional Correctional Centre; Madawaska Regional Correctional Centre; Dalhousie Regional Correctional Centre; New Brunswick Youth Centre; and New Brunswick Women’s Correctional Centre. Inmates will be offered extra phone calls during this time. Correctional Services will be monitoring the need to continue with this restriction and will be taking advice from officials with the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Child care Information for essential service workers on how to access child care services is now available through the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development’s Parent Portal or by calling 1-833-221-9339. Facilities remaining open to support essential service workers will follow the advice set out by the chief medical officer, including reduced group sizes and social distancing.

They may work on site or from home, depending on the nature of their job. Those workers sent home will remain on the payroll.

New Brunswickers are reminded to limit visits to nursing homes to help protect the most vulnerable residents. Those over 70 years old are at the highest risk of becoming infected with COVID-19.

Public Health is also asking restaurant owners to limit the number of customers to 50 per cent of the capacity of their dining areas. Take-out orders, deliveries and drive-through services are permitted. “It is imperative that everyone keep a distance of two metres (six feet) between themselves and others at all times,” said Russell. “Everyone must practise social distancing in all their interactions with neighbours, co-workers and fellow residents.” Russell said there is one additional presumptive case of COVID-19 in the province, bringing the number of presumptive or positive cases in New Brunswick to seven. The new case is a female, between 20 and 30 years old in Zone 2 (in the southern part of the province). The patient was screened, her recent travel history to Greece was confirmed and the patient was treated, tested and is in self-isolation. Diagnostic testing confirmed the case as presumptive. Additional testing to confirm the case as a positive COVID-19 case will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. “Active contact tracing is being conducted by regional public health officials. These individuals are already isolating, and Public Health officials have already taken swift action to implement effective precautions to prevent the infection from spreading,” said Russell. The regional health authorities will be opening community assessment centres to allow those who have been identified as high risk to be tested, without going to an Emergency Department. Individuals who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms will be directed to the assessment centres by Tele-Care 811. Once the individual has been assessed by Tele-Care, and if they require an in-person assessment, a referral will be provided to the Community Assessment Centre in their area. It is important to note that these centres are not walk-in clinics. They are appointment based and all appointments are made through Tele-Care 811.   16-03-20"

All four new presumptive patients, who are in Zone 3 (the central part of the province), are mildly symptomatic and are all close contacts to an earlier confirmed travel-related case. “I understand that today’s announcement might be frightening for New Brunswickers, but I ask that everyone keep this in perspective,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “All of these cases are connected to the first case. This has not spread through the community, and that is significant in terms of risk to the public. The risk to you and your family is still relatively low, and the majority of people who do get sick will fully recover.” The cases are as follows: ·         male, between 50 and 60 years of age; ·         female, between 50 and 60 years of age; ·         male, between 20 and 30 years of age; and, ·         male, between 20 and 30 years of age.

Effective Monday, March 16, all schools across the province will be closed for two weeks. This is in response to the COVID-19 situation. This closure will be reassessed on an ongoing basis. This was the first meeting of the all-party cabinet committee, with the collective goal of minimizing the spread of COVID-19. At this time, early learning and child-care facilities, including those located in schools, are not being closed. The directive continues to be that all individuals who have travelled internationally on or after March 9 still applies. Those travellers are to avoid early learning and childcare centres for a period of 14 days.

The vote came after members from the recognized political parties in the legislative assembly unanimously decided to accelerate it. This decision was a result of the evolving situation the province is facing due to COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus). “These are unprecedented times that require unprecedented leadership,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “We are moving forward in co-operation with the other political parties by putting New Brunswickers first and we are ensuring the effective continuity and stability of government operations. We will continue to work together, not only in the legislative assembly, but in the province to get through this critical time. Today’s actions reflect that all the members of the legislative assembly are committed to doing that.” “We are in the midst of an unprecedented situation with the concerns over the spread of COVID-19,” said Liberal Party leader Kevin Vickers. “Ensuring the health and safety of people is our top priority. I think we are all focused today on a common goal of protecting and supporting New Brunswickers.” “The details of the provincial budget became outdated in the last 24 hours, as our health system and public service need to rapidly draw on the money in this surplus budget to respond to the needs of New Brunswickers during the COVID-19 outbreak,” said Green Party Leader David Coon. “I am grateful that all MLAs agreed to co-operate so that our health-care workers and public servants have the money they need to care for us.” “Never before, in the lifetime of New Brunswickers, has there been a health crisis that has reached around the world,” said People’s Alliance leader Kris Austin. “It requires calm, patience and co-operation from everyone. It is a situation which goes beyond party lines. With this in mind, I and my fellow People’s Alliance MLAs Rick DeSaulniers and Michelle Conroy, are willing to do whatever is asked of them by the government to assist in reducing the numbers of cases this province could experience. Together we are stronger and so is the province as we work in co-operation, across party lines, to fight COVID-19 and for the health and safety of all New Brunswickers. We thank Dr. Russell and Dr. Muecke, along with their team at Public Health, for all they are doing during this difficult time. We will get through this together.” House business will continue at the legislative assembly on Tuesday, March 17, when members will assess what is needed to support government operations in response to COVID-19.     13-03-20"

Anderson-Mason said continuing with jury trials could have put New Brunswickers in a difficult position if they were forced to decide between protecting their health and fulfilling their legal obligation if summoned for jury duty. This decision will ensure no one is put in such a position. Sheriffs are contacting prospective jurors already summonsed for trials to advise them they are not required to attend. The Department of Justice and Office of the Attorney General will continue to work closely with members of the judiciary and other case parties to adjust to these exceptional circumstances, while ensuring important files move forward in a timely manner, said Anderson-Mason. 13-03-20"

Public Health would support a government decision to close schools in New Brunswick for two weeks in response to COVID-19. While we recognize the significant impact such a decision would have on families, students, schools and the entire community, this measure would help keep our residents safe. People may still be travelling and, as the spread of COVID-19 is continuing to escalate internationally, additional measures should be considered. Such measures should not extend to operators, staff or youth within early learning and childcare facilities at this time. The current risk assessment indicates that the risk of children acquiring COVID-19 is very low and the risk of them having serious disease outcomes is even lower. Early learning and childcare facilities operating within schools should also remain open at this time. Daycares should screen for the virus by asking parents if their child is unwell and if they have travelled in the last 14 days. Early learning and childcare facilities operators and staff who have travelled outside the country are asked to monitor themselves for symptoms for 14 days after they have returned to Canada. Operators can access information online to guide them in implementing appropriate measures within their facilities. Like our health-care workers, the role of early learning and child-care providers is a crucial one and I recognize their contribution to ensuring that essential services can continue to be provided to New Brunswick families. 13-03-20"

It takes more than governments and action from the health sector to protect the health and safety of New Brunswickers. Social distancing measures are a way to minimize COVID-19 transmission in the community. This means minimizing close contact with others during the peak of an outbreak. In addition to staying home when ill, New Brunswickers should plan actions they can take to reduce the spread of infection in places where people gather. Some social distancing measures need extensive preparation, especially those with large crowds. At this time, in an abundance of caution and to address public anxiety, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health recommends that any non-essential mass gathering (150 or more people) be cancelled or postponed until we are able to better determine the risk to our population. We understand that such a measure will disrupt the normal activities of our residents but believe it the prudent path to ensuring that we delay and minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our population. We are also encouraging amateur sports leagues or social gathering activities like dance or theatre to consider suspending their non-essential activities. Mass gatherings can have the potential for serious public health consequences if they are not planned and managed carefully. They can increase the spread of infectious diseases and cause additional strain on the health-care system when held during outbreaks. Infections can also be transmitted during transit to and from an event, and in the homes of event participants upon their return. Event planners need to consider the COVID-19 outbreak. Aside from cancelling or postponing an event, other measures to reduce infection risks during smaller mass gatherings include:  avoiding shaking hands; practising proper hygiene; avoiding common sleeping areas; discouraging attendees from sharing food or drinks; increasing social distance between others (ideally to two metres) by: broadcasting events offering virtual participation moving the venue from indoors to outdoors   eliminating self-serve buffet style eating at social or religious gatherings; encouraging people who are ill or those with high-risk medical conditions not to attend gatherings; supporting hand hygiene by providing hand sanitizer dispensers in prominent locations; ensuring event organizers have arrangements in place to safely isolate and transport people who become ill onsite; and communicating clearly to attendees about the risks and directing them to our advice on reducing the spread of illness.

Anyone who is feeling unwell should not enter such a facility. We are very concerned about keeping this infection out of nursing homes, seniors’ residences, and other locations where vulnerable people gather. Visitors who have travelled outside the country in the last 14 days are restricted from entering long-term care homes. Those who have travelled outside the country in the last 14 days are also restricted from entering health-care facilities to visit those most at risk for severe illness. These measures do not apply to health-care professionals who work in those institutions unless they have visited the Hubei province in China, Iran or Italy. Anyone who has traveled internationally in the past 14 days should monitor themselves for 14 days from when they arrived back in Canada. Individual risk will vary depending upon the destination. People arriving from Iran or the Chinese province of Hubei will need to isolate themselves regardless of symptoms.

Symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing may take up to 14 days to appear.

The Building Code Administration Act would ensure that safe building standards are met. “We have heard from stakeholders who have been waiting years for the government to ensure consistency across our province, and we are taking action to make it happen,” said Public Safety Minister and Solicitor General Carl Urquhart. “This legislation will give cabinet the authority to adopt the latest version of the National Building Code, which would allow for the construction of wood-framed buildings of up to six stories.” The act would also allow cabinet to adopt the National Energy Code for Buildings. Having the same standards across the province would also lead to benefits and help ensure efficiency for builders. “That is good news for people who want to see us using New Brunswick resources and good news for those who want to see us lowering everyone’s carbon footprint,” said Urquhart. “The government’s goal is to have the new building code in place across New Brunswick in time for the start of the 2021 construction season.” The act would see the Department of Public Safety take over administration of building codes in the province from the Department of Environment and Local Government within one year. This change would also ensure that building-related matters will be separated from the development, land-use and community planning matters which will continue to be the responsibility of the Department of Environment and Local Government.

Today’s tax measure is a concrete step towards a prosperous, greener and more vibrant New Brunswick.” Under the proposed amendments, the gasoline tax will decrease from 15.5 cents per litre to 10.87 cents per litre. The motive fuel tax will decrease from 21.5 cents per litre to 15.45 cents per litre. The reductions are part of the made-in-New Brunswick carbon tax announced earlier in December. The New Brunswick carbon tax, which will be effective on April 1, is the alternative to the federal government’s backstop carbon fuel levy and applies to 20 separate fuels. “Our made-in-New Brunswick carbon tax is fair and will achieve results,” said Steeves. “It brings parity to fuel prices in other Atlantic provinces to New Brunswick consumers, businesses, and industry. It also recognizes our unique economic realities, and it will help us to reach the federal government’s emissions targets.” With this reduction, there will be an effective price on carbon of two cents per litre in 2020-21. All carbon revenue will stay in New Brunswick and will be reinvested into climate change initiatives. More details on the made-in-New Brunswick carbon tax plan will be available in the coming weeks.

Revenues are projected to grow by 3.4 per cent, while spending is expected to grow by 3.5 per cent. Net debt will be reduced by $129.3 million. The Department of Finance and Treasury Board projects that the New Brunswick economy will expand by 1.2 per cent in 2020-21. The government is projecting a surplus of $97.8 million for 2019-20, an improvement of $74.6 million over budget. This is the first time a surplus was budgeted and successfully achieved since before the global financial crisis in 2008. Also, for the first time in 13 years, the net debt is projected to decrease by $148.4 million from the 2018-19 level. Addressing priority areas Responsible financial management allows the government to address the following pressing issues: Dependable public health care  More than $2.9 billion in funding for health, a 3.9 per cent increase over last year which is double the rate of inflation expected for New Brunswick. $1.5 million will be added to the vaccination program so that all New Brunswickers will have access to free flu shots to protect themselves and their families. An Immunization Registry will also be launched. An additional $6.2 million will be added to oncology drug funding and CAR-T therapies to more effectively treat cancer. $5.5 million to mental health programs in social development, health care, and education ($3 million in mental health services across the province, $1.4 million in the education system, $1.1 million in addiction and treatment programs). $4.2 million for placing nurse practitioners in emergency rooms and clinics around the province. $5 million for a rural incentive program to ensure that rural New Brunswick maintains and gains new physician resources in the years to come. $5 million to help move Alternative Level of Care (ALC) patients out of the hospitals and to relocate them into nursing homes and special care homes.  World-class education  $7.1 million to hire more teachers for the upcoming school year. $3 million to support teachers with inclusion in the classroom. $6.1 million to address the growth in demand for educational assistants in schools. $1.3 million to work with 12 schools to create new opportunities for learning French as a second language in the elementary, middle, and high schools. $1.1 million more in the francophone education sector to support change leadership with school administrators, and further career exploration for students; A wage increase of 75 cents-per-hour for early childhood educators. A decrease of interest rates on the provincial portion of student loans to the prime rate from the prime rate plus 2.5 per cent.  Vibrant and sustainable communities  $5.4 million to increase social assistance rates under the Transitional Assistance Program, Transitional Assistance Program – Single Employable, and the Extended Benefit Program. The indexation of social assistance rates to the Consumer Price Index. $36 million for investments in climate change initiatives, and an additional $9 million to ensure the competitiveness of the natural gas distribution system. $500,000 to the Arts Development Trust Fund, a 70 per cent increase over the 2019-20 level. $500,000 for the Sports Development Trust Fund, double the amount in 2019-20. $1.6 million to the New Brunswick Legal Aid Services Commission (NBLASC) to improve access to legal services for those who need the support. A 25 per cent increase in the rates paid to foster caregivers to assist them in providing a safe and secure home to children under their care. $800,000 to ensure core funding for resource development consultation co-ordinator positions within First Nation communities. The role of these co-ordinators will be to act as liaisons to the community, Chief and Council, government and proponents.  Lower taxes Responsible financial management allows the government to begin reducing taxes:  Beginning with the 2021 taxation year, a 50 per cent reduction of the provincial non-owner-occupied property residential tax rate (double-taxation) over a four-year period to $0.5617 per $100 of assessment from $1.1233. This represents a reduction of 14.04 cents per year until 2024. Beginning with the 2021 taxation year, a reduction over a four-year period of the provincial non-residential property tax rate to $1.8560 per $100 of assessment from $2.1860, which is a reduction of 8.25 cents per year until 2024. As part of the made-in New Brunswick carbon plan, effective April 1, 2020, the gasoline tax will decrease by 4.63 cents per litre and the motive fuel (diesel) tax will decrease by 6.05 cents per litre.  Continued debt reduction Responsible financial management allows the government to reduce its net debt. To further ensure continued fiscal progress, the government is acting on the recommendation of the Auditor General and will publish, for the first time ever, multi-year net debt-reduction targets and net debt-to-GDP targets. Under this plan, the government expects to reduce net debt by $530 million over the next four years and, combined with economic growth, the net debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall to 32 per cent by 2023-24. “By acting with a sense of urgency, our government has built a solid financial foundation,” said Steeves. “We have made great progress in a short period of time, but there is still much more to do. There are many challenges ahead, and we see constant rising demands. Our 2020-21 budget recognizes our challenges, addresses them head-on, and creates the conditions for growth while improving our financial flexibility.” The 2020-21 budget speech and other relevant documents are available online. 10-03-20"

Individual risk will vary depending upon the destination. People arriving from Iran or the Chinese province of Hubei will need to isolate themselves regardless of symptoms. Older adults and people who have certain chronic medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart and lung disease are more likely to contract the novel coronavirus and to experience more severe symptoms. This particular group should plan to start minimizing attendance at crowded gatherings and mass events or think of other ways of participating (i.e. virtual attendance). Stay in touch with others through phone, email or text. This group should think about what health and food supplies they need on hand should they have to stay home, and slowly start replenishing their shelves with non-perishable, easy-to-prepare foods like dried pasta and sauce and canned soup, vegetables and beans.

Higgs said he wants to ensure residents in these regions have the opportunity to fully engage in the consultation process. The vacancy in Saint Croix was created when the incumbent, Greg Thompson, passed away in September of 2019. The vacancy in Shediac Bay-Dieppe was created when the incumbent, Brian Gallant, resigned his seat in October of 2019. Currently, the Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals each hold 20 seats in the legislative assembly, the Greens and the People’s Alliance each hold three seats, one MLA sits as an independent and two seats are vacant.   09-03-20"

As New Brunswickers get ready this year, I encourage them to check with insurance providers about flood insurance. People who can get affordable insurance that would cover the costs associated with flooding are ineligible for disaster financial assistance.” The River Watch program is a collaboration between the Department of Environment and Local Government and the Department of Public Safety’s New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization. Other partners include NB Power, watershed groups, federal and provincial governments as well as agencies in the United States involved in monitoring and forecasting the water flow in the province's rivers and streams. “A number of factors contribute to flooding, including precipitation, snow pack, air temperature, and river ice,” said Environment and Local Government Minister Jeff Carr. “Our hydrologists work with numerous partners to monitor and forecast water levels, flows and identify any potential problems that could come with the spring freshet.” Each morning River Watch officials, including hydrology experts, receive a weather briefing and collect data from several sources to build river models and forecasts. The public is then informed if there are potential threats. During the River Watch season, New Brunswickers are advised to:  be prepared for possible flooding and have a plan to evacuate and be self-sufficient for at least 72 hours;   move belongings to higher ground if their property is near a waterway or is in an area that is prone to flooding;   avoid the banks of waterways, as they become dangerous this time of year. The water is cold and currents are swift and could carry debris;   be aware that, as ice continues to deteriorate, it will become unsafe to cross waterways on foot, in cars, or on snowmobiles or ATVs;   call the River Watch toll-free number, 1-888-561-4048, to receive the latest recorded water levels, forecasts and public advisories;   call 511 for road closures and conditions or check online;   read helpful tips, the latest forecasts and public advisories by visiting the River Watch website, or by following the Emergency Measures Organization on Twitter and Facebook; and   report significant ice jams or rising water. If you need advice, contact the Emergency Measures Organization at 1-800-561-4034.  Weather warnings are also available online.

Every year we dedicate this day to acknowledging the economic, political and social contributions of women from the past, the present and the ones we know will contribute in the future. Recognized for the first time by the United Nations in 1975, International Women’s Day celebrates women’s achievements and acknowledges the challenges they continue to face in the quest for gender equality. By empowering women, we are helping to create a better future for us all. For when women succeed, so do families, communities and our whole society. International Women’s Day provides us with an opportunity to celebrate women from all walks of life. It is a time to reflect upon how far we come, as well as all we have left to do to ensure gender equality here at home and across the globe. This year, in honour of this important day, we have launched a new initiative to celebrate the contributions of New Brunswick women. Women face unique challenges within our society and often have many inspiring stories to share; stories of courage, strength and perseverance. However, these women and their stories often do not appear in history books. So, in an effort to recognize and highlight the impact they have had on our lives, we are introducing the new VIVE Awards (Visionary, Inspirational, Vibrant, Empowering) to honour these New Brunswick women.

STEPHEN (GNB) – The provincial and federal governments have announced the third project from round one of the Healthy Seniors Pilot Project. The project aims to engage seniors in proactively monitoring their health status and risk factors with the use of a new digital health platform and support from health-care professionals. “Helping seniors stay healthy and at home for as long as possible is important to our government and our health care system,” said Social Development Minister Dorothy Shephard. “This project will help to improve the health of its participants as they track different risk factors and will encourage them to make healthier lifestyle choices, which in turn will have a positive outcome on their overall well-being.” The Healthy Seniors Pilot Project was announced in June 2018 and will be carried out over three years. It focuses on exploring new ideas, with the goal of improving the quality of life for seniors. “Right across the country, seniors have made tremendous contributions over the course of their lives,” said federal Health Minister Patty Hadju. “Our governments want Canada’s older population to enjoy a positive quality of life and to learn more about how to promote healthy aging for seniors. Through projects like the one announced today, and others funded through the Healthy Seniors Pilot Project, we can help seniors maintain health, independence, and quality of life.” “We are excited to discover how weekly client monitoring will immediately increase the quality of life for seniors as they become more aware of their health and are empowered to take action,” said Will Bernard, chief operating officer of Kindred Home Care. “The longer-term goal is to discover trends in their health data using predictive analytics which could be used to prevent hospitalizations, allowing seniors to stay healthier in their own homes, while reducing expensive hospitalizations for the province.” More than $1.6 million is allocated for the project, which targets seniors receiving services from Kindred Home Care in St. Stephen, Fredericton, Moncton, Sackville, Saint John, Kings County, Carleton County, Victoria County, Grand Manan, St. George and Saint Andrews. The project is a collaboration with Fredericton-based VeroSource Solutions and the University of New Brunswick. “We know that innovative technology is playing an increasingly vital role in health care,” said Mark McAllister, chief executive officer of VeroSource Solutions. “We are excited to be part of the transformation that is unlocking potential in Canadian health care. Our collaboration with Kindred Home Care and the University of New Brunswick ensures our technology addresses real-world issues and is backed by evidence-based research.” “Experience shows that technology innovation is only part of the battle,” said Erik Scheme, New Brunswick Innovation Research Chair in Medical Technologies at the University of New Brunswick. “Our focus is applied research programs that explore the use of tools and technology that support and add value to regular person-to-person interactions as part of a preventative monitoring program.” Funding for the project was announced as part of the 2018 federal budget, and is available for government and non-governmental groups to initiate projects that will align with, support and further the implementation of the New Brunswick Aging Strategy.

Clocks should be moved forward one hour as of 2 a.m. on Sunday, March 8. “Smoke and carbon monoxide alarms are the first line of defence,” said fire marshal Mike Lewis. “A working smoke alarm remains the single most effective tool in preventing fire deaths and injuries by giving you precious moments to escape. Check that they are working properly by changing batteries and testing them.” The Office of the Fire Marshal urges the public to follow these steps to ensure their home is protected:  Install smoke alarms in every bedroom, outside each sleeping area, and on every level of your home including the basement. Replace smoke alarms that are older than 10 years, whether they are battery powered or hardwired. If you have an attached garage or any device that burns wood, gas, oil or propane, install a carbon monoxide alarm outside all sleeping areas. Replace these alarms every seven to 10 years depending upon the manufacturer’s guidelines. Press the test button on each smoke and carbon monoxide alarm. If it sounds, it confirms power is present and circuits are operating. Create and practice an escape plan with your family.  Additional fire safety tips are available online. 06-03-20"

It includes nine priority actions divided into three pillars:  Income Security: includes actions addressing improvements to social assistance, changes to the Employment Standards Act and an increase of the capacity and sustainability of social enterprises. Co-ordination of Programs and Services: includes actions towards a review of government programs, services and tax policies targeted to low-income individuals, and the implementation of a One-Stop-Shop service to help New Brunswickers access information and navigate government and community programs and services. Inclusion and Healthy Communities: includes actions bringing improvement to mental and addictions services, the development of regional transportation plans, work with partners to provide inclusive opportunities for recreation activities for New Brunswickers on a low income, and the development of food programs in all schools.  The objective of the plan is to reduce income poverty by at least 50 per cent by 2030, in line with the objectives of Opportunity for All, Canada’s first poverty reduction strategy, and those of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainability of the United Nations. Stéphane Leclair, executive director of the corporation, said the innovative approach adopted over the past 10 years of bringing together people who live or have lived in poverty with representatives of the non-profit sector, the business sector, and the government has produced a stimulating movement of community capacity building. The Community Inclusion Networks will continue to play a critical role in calling upon local and regional partners to help them develop their regional plans for poverty reduction and economic and social inclusion, said Leclair. Some of the highlights of Overcoming Poverty Together over the past 10 years include:  New Brunswick Drug Plan Healthy Smiles, Clear Vision program Provincial transportation strategy and community transportation services in New Brunswick Minimum wage increases Free daycare Free post-secondary tuition program  Below are a few statistics about poverty in New Brunswick:  In 2009: the poverty rate was 14.2 per cent or a total of 104,000 people. In 2018, (the most recent year of available data): the poverty rate was 7.9 per cent or a total of 58,000 people. There has been a 44 per cent decrease, or a total of 46,000 fewer people living in poverty from 2009 to 2018. The goal for Overcoming Poverty together 3: Reduction of the number of people living below the poverty line in New Brunswick to 50,000, or seven per cent, by 2030.  The Economic and Social Inclusion Corporation received 25,000 comments from 2,500 participants during a public engagement process that took place across the province in the winter and spring 2019. “This was the most comprehensive in the province in terms of poverty since the adoption and implementation of the first plan in 2009,” said Leclair. “Forty community dialogues, eight sectoral dialogues, an online survey, focus groups with people living in poverty, a call for briefs from non-profit organizations and gatherings with subject matter experts were also part of the process.” The plan takes effect immediately. 05-03-20"

We are asking all travellers who are returning to New Brunswick from outside the country, no matter where they were in the world, to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms for 14 days. Symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing may take up to 14 days to appear. Should an individual who has recently traveled outside the country experience these symptoms, they should:  isolate themselves from others as quickly as possible;   immediately call 811 or their health-care provider;   describe their symptoms and travel history; and   follow instructions carefully.  There are several ways that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could affect the province but the provincial government is committed to being prepared for any eventuality.

A new process comes into effect today, March 2, which will eliminate the requirement for an individual to appear in court to set a court date. Instead, individuals will now need to file a notice of dispute with the court within 45 days of receiving a ticket to get their court date. If no notice is filed, the individual will be deemed guilty. “These changes will create efficiencies in our courts by removing uncontested tickets from the court process and by reducing the number of times an individual appears in court for a contested ticket,” said Justice Minister and Attorney General Andrea Anderson-Mason. “This will free up valuable time in our court system which could be used on other important matters.” More information about the process will be printed on tickets and is available online. The change in the ticketing process comes as the RCMP will begin issuing e-tickets in the province as of today. “We are excited to be introducing e-ticketing into the province’s enforcement activities,” said Public Safety Minister Carl Urquhart. “Not only will this create a more modern and efficient system, it will help reduce the time peace officers spend roadside.” The e-ticketing process will consist of an officer swiping a driver’s licence through an electronic card reader. The offence information is then added by the officer and an e-ticket is printed directly from the officer’s vehicle. The electronic record is then shared with the province and saved in an information system that is accessible to the police, the courts and Service New Brunswick. The RCMP in New Brunswick will be the first to employ the technology as part of a phased-in approach. Initially, it will only be used for most violations under the Motor Vehicle Act.

As of today, New Brunswick continues to have no confirmed cases, but we cannot be complacent. We need to take the appropriate precautions to lower the risk to all of us. I know many people have already left or will be travelling outside of New Brunswick for the March break. For those travelling, the Public Health Agency of Canada is regularly posting travel notices. In addition, all travellers who are returning to New Brunswick, no matter where they were in the world, need to monitor themselves and their loved ones closely for symptoms, which include a fever, a cough and difficulty breathing. Anyone with those symptoms should call Tele-Care at 8-1-1 before going to a hospital or doctor’s office so that the proper precautions can be taken to reduce further spread of the disease. All of us can also take simple actions that can help stop the spread of any type of communicable disease. Regular hand washing, coughing or sneezing into your elbow, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth, and staying home when you are sick can greatly reduce the risk of infection spreading. I want to assure New Brunswickers that our government officials are conducting emergency planning so that we are communicating, planning and co-ordinating with first responders, our communities and individual New Brunswickers to ensure we are ready. I am personally having daily briefings with Public Health and Emergency Measures Organization leaders to receive any pertinent updates on the situation and our preparedness plans. Recognizing that this disease knows no borders, I have also written to Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, the chair of the Council of the Federation which represents all premiers across the country. The goal is to ensure that good information is shared nationally about how our response plans will work, and what Canadians need to do to be ready. I know that information has and will continue to come from a number of sources. It is important that people only count on the information from trusted sources to direct what they should do. In that regard, as the situation continues to evolve, information will be continuously provided and updated at gnb.ca/coronavirus, on the Government of New Brunswick social media channels, through traditional media and other methods as required.

Recognizing the red flags of fraud is the best defense against these losses, according to the Financial and Consumer Services Commission. The message coincides with Fraud Prevention Month, during which the commission will be sharing tools and resources to help New Brunswickers stay out of fraud’s reach. The $3.5 million is what was reported to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, however research indicates that only about five per cent of frauds are actually reported. According to the centre, over the past year, extortion scams are a type of fraud that have become prevalent in New Brunswick. “While extortion scams can each look very different, at the heart of the fraud is the attempt to compel you into sending money or personal information by scaring you and catching you off guard,” said Sara Wilson, acting director of education and communications and spokesperson for the commission. The commission reminds New Brunswickers that even though frauds and scams such as extortion scams are changing all the time, the red flags of fraud are consistent across the board. These include:  An offer sounding too good to be true. A threat that if you don’t act immediately you will be arrested or prosecuted. A request for you to confirm personal or financial information when they have contacted you. A request that you to pay for something in the form of gift cards or cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin.  More red flags of fraud and details on common scams targeting New Brunswickers are available online. The commission will be sharing videos on private mortgages on its social media channels and will be holding a fraud-themed contest on Fortune, its online trivia game, from March 2 to April 1. The top three players at the end of the month will receive prizes. The commission will also host a booth at the Greater Moncton Home Show from March 20 to 22 to share information on how to stay out of fraud’s reach. “Asking questions and thinking seriously before making financial or purchasing decisions is the best way to protect yourself from being victimized by a con artist or from making a decision that is not in your best interest,” said Wilson. “We want New Brunswick consumers to have the tools to protect themselves so they can realize their financial goals.” Fraud Prevention Month is an annual awareness initiative to help empower Canadians with the information they need to recognize, reject and report fraud. There are numerous partners across the province, and the country, who participate in the initiative including the commission. The Financial and Consumer Services Commission has the mandate to protect consumers and enhance public confidence in the financial and consumer marketplace through the provision of regulatory and educational services. It is responsible for the administration and enforcement of provincial legislation regulating mortgage brokers, payday lenders, real estate, securities, insurance, pensions, credit unions, trust and loan companies, co-operatives, and a wide range of other consumer legislation. It is an independent Crown corporation funded by the regulatory fees and assessments paid by the regulated sectors. Educational tools and resources are available online. 28-02-20"

Restrictions will continue until midnight on Sunday, May 17 in southern New Brunswick and until midnight, Sunday, May 24 in northern New Brunswick.

The commission is seeing an increase in complaints from consumers about inappropriate behaviour from payday lending businesses that are not licensed to operate in the province. These complaints include reports of intimidating collection practices and aggressive communication methods. Some consumers have reported that unlicensed payday lending businesses have contacted them at their place of employment or contacted their employer or coworkers when they fall behind in their payments, which is against the law. Consumers seeking out credit options should be aware that using the services of a company that isn’t licensed to operate in the province puts them at a greater risk for harm. Using licensed lenders provides consumers with some added legal protections from predatory lending practices, such as interest rate caps, disclosure requirements and cancellation options. Since the implementation of the Cost of Credit Disclosure and Payday Loans Act in 2018, payday lenders must be licensed by the commission, whether they have a physical location or are only offering loans online. Payday advances are high-cost loans. New Brunswick legislation caps the cost of a payday loan at $15 per $100 borrowed, which is the equivalent of 392 per cent interest over a 14-day period. Consumers are reminded to consider all the options available for short-term borrowing situations and make sure they understand the cost of borrowing before agreeing to a payday loan. Consumers are cautioned that the following online businesses are not licensed to offer, arrange or provide payday loans in New Brunswick: ·         Truepaydayloan.ca ·         cash2gonow.com ·         cashbuddy500.com ·         cashflow500.ca ·         cashflow500payday.com ·         creditmontreal500.com ·         fastmoneyloans.ca ·         nationalpaydayloan.ca ·         Paydayking500.com ·         pretsohben.com ·         Rapidpaydayloans.net ·         royalfinances.ca ·         solutions500.com ·         speedypayloans.ca Consumers can check if a payday lender is licensed by visiting the commission’s website. The commission also has resources on its website to educate consumers about the importance of using licensed payday lenders and to help consumers understand their rights and responsibilities when using a payday lender.

Most New Brunswickers understand and agree that we have a crisis in health care in this province, however we do not have clarity about what is required to address it. I am concerned by the number of gaps in the health system that have been identified as the days have rolled on. The current state is not acceptable. I believed that before; I believe it even more today. New Brunswickers deserve better. I recognize that people in rural New Brunswick face unique challenges and come to the table with a unique perspective. With that in mind the regional health authorities have agreed not to proceed with the implementation date of March 11 for the reform plans. This means they will not proceed with the reduction of hours in emergency departments in Sussex, Sackville, Sainte-Anne-de-Kent, Caraquet, Grand Falls and Perth-Andover. I cannot in good conscience move forward without addressing the concerns and fears that have been brought to light. That is why I will personally visit these communities to initiate the process to ensure that we hear from community leaders, the people delivering care and concerned citizens. We will conduct these meetings in April and May. Our government will also hold a health-care summit in June with the goal of developing a strategy to ensure a sustainable and reliable public health-care system for the future.  This must also address the challenges faced in rural communities. We will release findings from the community meetings and the summit in the fall. I have said time and time again that we are on a mission to save New Brunswick, and that includes tackling the crisis in health care. An aging demographic coupled with a growing labour force shortage is hampering our ability to provide the right care, in the right place, at the right time. But we need people in this province to be part of the solution and that must start with hearing from the people most impacted. 16-02-20"

The changes we will be implementing are designed to improve access and ensure services are there when patients need them most.” “Working closely with our colleagues at Vitalité, we have proposed these changes based on a careful and thorough review of Horizon’s programs and services, the needs of our patients and clients, and the reality of our staffing resources,” said Karen McGrath, president and chief executive officer of Horizon Health Network. “In order to really improve care, we must make significant changes to the way we are currently doing things. These changes we have announced today prepare us for the challenges we are facing.” Approximately 35 per cent of physicians, 40 per cent of nurses, and 40 per cent of medical laboratory technologists are eligible for retirement over the next five years – a significant challenge that cannot be managed through recruitment alone. Health-care professionals must be moved from services which are underutilized and redeployed to meet the growing needs of the New Brunswick population. To that end, the following measures are being taken to improve the sustainability of the health-care system, enhance quality of service to patients, and increase timely access to much-needed services. Importantly, these changes will ensure all hospitals remain open across New Brunswick and are better positioned to contribute to the health of their communities: Optimizing emergency department hours to support vital services To free up time and resources for physicians and nurse practitioners, the hours of emergency departments in six community hospitals will be adjusted. These hospitals are currently open 24 hours and see, on average, only five patients overnight. Effective March 11, the emergency departments at Sussex Health Centre, Sackville Memorial Hospital, Hotel-Dieu of St. Joseph in Perth-Andover, Stella-Maris-de-Kent Hospital in Sainte-Anne-de Kent, Enfant-Jésus Hospital in Caraquet and Grand Falls General Hospital will operate from 8 a.m. to midnight with the last patient being accepted before 10 p.m. This model has provided care for patients at Oromocto Public Hospital since 2002. On average, these hospitals see five patients per night, and most are not emergencies. “In critical situations, such as trauma, heart attacks and strokes – ambulances often take patients directly to larger centres where they can access the specialized services they need,” said Horizon president and CEO Karen McGrath. “These changes will allow physicians and nurse practitioners to see more patients in the daytime, in their community practice.” Reducing waitlists by more than half Adjusting the emergency department hours in these six communities will allow for a nurse practitioner to be hired in Sussex, Sackville, Perth-Andover, Sainte-Anne-de Kent, Caraquet and Grand Falls. Nurse practitioner clinics will also open in the province’s largest urban centres to handle high case loads and reduce the provincial waitlist for a family doctor or nurse practitioner by 18,000 people or 54 per cent. In addition, nurse practitioners will also be added to emergency departments in Moncton, Saint John and Fredericton to reduce wait times. Improving addiction and mental health services Mental health services will be added in the six communities where changes are being made to emergency department hours. These additional mental heath clinicians will add to the resources that currently exist in these communities. To further address this growing need, the regional health authorities are developing a new model of care to reduce wait times and offer a broad range of services in community mental health clinics. Converting 120 acute care beds into long-term chronic care beds In the six hospitals with changes to emergency department hours, the regional health authorities will convert acute care beds to long-term chronic care beds, recognizing most are already used today by seniors waiting for an alternative level of care in the community or a nursing home. By officially re-classifying them as long-term care beds, this will allow staff to support acute care patients and provide the right resources to these patients to receive more appropriate care. Ongoing patient-centric decision making and planning The regional heath authorities have also announced they are reviewing several service areas to better deal with wait times, the aging population and rising demand for mental health services. Areas under review include the creation of a centralized co-ordination and referral model for specialists to reduce surgical wait times across the province, better organizing laboratory services, improving food and environmental services, accelerating nursing home assessments, and creating more comprehensive home-care options in communities through the use of technology, such as text and email to enhance the existing Tele-Care 811 program. Furthermore, the New Brunswick Health Council will launch an independent and transparent review of clinical services offered within the provincial hospitals to identify a more sustainable model. These changes further build on initiatives that have already been implemented, including eliminating the physician billing number system and strategies aimed at recruiting and retaining nurses, rural physicians, psychologists and paramedics. Government receives and endorses recommendations “We are listening to the experts, and I am pleased that the regional health authorities have taken several important steps to improve our health-care system in New Brunswick,” said Health Minister Hugh J. Flemming. “I am confident the plan will improve access to care and quality services – all while ensuring the long-term sustainability of our system for the people of this province and generations to come.” 11-02-20"

During the winter months wildlife is more vulnerable to being chased by dogs. The exhaustion caused by running from dogs can lead to their death even if they escape from being caught. During the winter, Conservation Officers with the Department of Public Safety conduct routine patrols for dogs at large. Owners who let their dogs run loose are liable to a minimum fine of $124.50. In addition, several regulated hunting and fur-harvesting seasons are now open and extend through the winter months. In the past, there have been incidents where pets running loose have been caught in traps or snares. Fur harvesters operating in areas visited by owners of pets should modify their traps or snares or place them away from trails or roads. Hunters and trappers are reminded that it is illegal to set traps or snares within 300 metres (984 feet) of dwellings, schools, playgrounds, athletic fields, solid-waste disposal sites and places of business. Pet owners are reminded that: ·         under the Fish and Wildlife Act, it is illegal for dogs to run at large in a wildlife area; ·         pets should be kept under control or leashed at all times to minimize harassment of wildlife; and ·         it is illegal to disturb any legally placed trap or snare.

Consumers who have inquiries or complaints about services rendered by RH Enterprises are encouraged to contact the commission at 1-866-933-2222. In November, the commission released two news alerts about high-pressure sales tactics by door-to-door sellers when offering home inspections and mould removal services. Complainants have reported that upon visiting the home for a free inspection, they are informed that their attic is filled with mould and that for health and safety reasons remediation needs to happen immediately.

The committee will also gather information on climate change, environmental stewardship and other related issues from stakeholders and subject-matter experts and prepare reports with recommendations to the legislative assembly. “We believe as a committee that the issue of climate change is urgent and that action needs to be timely,” said Riverview MLA Bruce Fitch, committee chair. “We also want to be proactive about environmental concerns and look for long-term solutions to issues that impact us all.” This week, the committee is receiving its first round of updates from the departments of Environment and Local Government; Natural Resources and Energy Development; Transportation and Infrastructure; Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries; Public Safety, as well as from Service New Brunswick and NB Power. The hearings are open to the public and take place at the legislative assembly building in Fredericton. The audio of the hearings is also available on the assembly’s website.

He said experts from across the country helped to develop the plan, which will increase the province’s population, productivity, private investment and exports. During his state of the province address this evening, Higgs said the province worked closely with industry, the academic community and technology leaders to develop new initiatives to support an energized private sector. “We know that with the right infrastructure, tax and policy environment, our province can become a natural magnet for investment,” he said. “We need to lessen our dependency on incentives, expand our tax base, reach one million in population and lower our median age.” Higgs said the provincial government must be bold enough to aim higher and make the right changes to facilitate investment and spur business growth. That includes pursuing innovative technologies to boost the competitiveness of traditional resource sectors, more aggressively supporting export growth in key international markets, and focusing upon the areas where the province has a clear advantage. These initiatives include:  Working with the federal government to increase immigration to 10,000 people per year by 2027.   Creating a program to help newcomers obtain faster recognition for credentials and to help them cut through the red tape of opening a business, thereby increasing the likelihood they will remain in New Brunswick.   Launching a special service for large-scale projects to help proponents navigate the regulatory and approval process.   Opening new offices in Europe and India to increase and diversify exports and to attract international talent and investments.   Standardizing economic development funding to reduce duplication, improve oversight and maximize results.   Adjusting policy and regulation to facilitate the development and introduction of emerging technologies.   Investing in globalizing the New Brunswick brand to support export sales.  Higgs also outlined strategies to help Opportunities NB act more aggressively over the coming three to five years in order to promote growth. These include:  Creating strategic networks that connect business in new ways across the province to take advantage of lower production costs which can result from combining their efforts for export and research.   Supporting the growth of the manufacturing and services sectors through innovative technology.   Attracting clusters in three emerging sectors: cybersecurity, digital health and energy innovation.  “We know that the low rate at which our businesses adopt to new technology is holding them back,” said Higgs. “So, we will help them understand, assess and adopt the tools that will enhance their productivity.” “It is time for New Brunswick to let the world know that we are back on track,” said Higgs. “In addition to balancing the budget, for the second year in a row, the net debt is projected to go down this fiscal year by $233 million. “We will use the approximately $10 million saved in interest each year to help address the serious addiction and mental health issues we are facing in our society,” he said. Higgs called upon the business community to continue their efforts to support growth, embrace diversity in their workplaces and help expose young New Brunswickers to the multitude of career paths available in the province. “Each of us needs to be a brand ambassador for this province,” he said.   30-01-20"

Construction is expected to begin this spring. “I am pleased to see the ongoing development of this project to respond to the needs of the community, as well as of the greater Fredericton area,” said Education and Early Childhood Development Minister Dominic Cardy. “This school will allow students to learn in their own community.” Due to increased enrolment, schools in the Fredericton region use modular classrooms for up to 19 per cent of all classes. Because there is currently no school in Hanwell, about 450 students from the community are bused to and from schools in Fredericton. The commute takes between 30 and 60 minutes per trip. The new K-8 school to be built will accommodate 650 students and will be built next to the Hanwell Community Centre. It will feature 36 classrooms, an early childhood room, an outdoor learning area, two gyms, specialty learning spaces such as music rooms, a performing arts room, art rooms, science rooms, technology labs and resource spaces, and open project work areas for group collaboration. “This is an important project for the development of our growing community,” said Hanwell Mayor Susan Cassidy. “The new school will be an asset for the future of Hanwell.”   27-01-20"

The move is intended to reduce wait times at four emergency room departments, and to reduce the provincial waitlist for a family doctor or nurse practitioner by more than half, or more than 18,000 patients. “Our health care system is affected by the aging population and by numerous recruitment challenges, but it is also very resilient,” said Gilles Lanteigne, president and CEO of the Vitalité Health Network. “Today, with the announcement of the addition of these nurse practitioners, we are clearly demonstrating that we are always ready and ready to take on all the challenges that lie ahead. I am confident that with joint work and effort, we will transform New Brunswick health care to achieve excellence for our communities and for that of future generations.” “Horizon is committed to achieving a health-care system in New Brunswick that works for our people – and for our future,” said Karen McGrath, the health authority’s president and CEO. “The addition of nurse practitioners to our team is fantastic news for our organization, our patients, clients, families and communities, and for the health-care system in New Brunswick.” A total of eight nurse practitioners will be available to treat lowest urgency cases at the Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital in Fredericton; the Saint John Regional Hospital; the Moncton Hospital and the Dr. Georges-L. Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton. Six nurse practitioners will also be placed throughout the province at locations determined by the regional health authorities. Eighteen nurse practitioners will work in clinics to be established in Fredericton and Saint John, and at the previously-established pilot project clinic in Moncton. The pilot project had been announced in March 2019. The nurse practitioner clinics are intended to reduce the number of residents on Patient Connect NB, which is a provincially managed, bilingual patient registry for people looking for a new primary health-care provider; either a family doctor or nurse practitioner. “Our vision of a sustainable health-care system requires innovation, redesign and improvement,” said Health Minister Hugh J. Flemming. “The Department of Health and the regional health authorities have worked together to enhance emergency departments and develop nurse practitioner clinics to improve both acute and primary health care.” Recruitment for the nurse practitioners will begin immediately.   27-01-20"

Steeves will also host a Facebook Live event on Feb. 18 at 2 p.m. A pre-budget consultation document has been prepared which provides context on the challenges facing the province, contains current financial information, and lists six questions related to the government’s top six priorities:  What are the most important issues when it comes to providing dependable public health care?   What opportunities are there to provide a world-class education to our children?   How can the private sector be energized?   What does a vibrant and sustainable community mean to you?   What opportunities exist to improve the value for money in the delivery of government services?   What steps should be taken to reduce the province’s $14 billion net debt?  “The budget that we present on March 10 will build upon the financial progress that we have made so far,” said Steeves. “Responsible management of public finances is an ongoing exercise. We must remain consistent in our approach and establish a strong foundation that will benefit our children and grandchildren.” More information about the pre-budget consultation process is available online. 27-01-20"

At that time, I committed to updating New Brunswickers on the progress we make regarding these recommendations. Shortly after, I also agreed to review and implement the nine recommendations from the Child and Youth Advocate’s report Behind Closed Doors: A Story of Neglect. I am pleased to report that 26 of the 116 recommendations have been completed, which represents 22 per cent. Work is underway on an additional 23 recommendations. Highlights of what has been accomplished include:  Amendments have been introduced to the Family Services Act to allow the development of a new Children’s Services and Resources Regulation. This regulation will support new services and resources, such as kinship care and the transfer of guardianship, and strengthen approaches that enable children to safely remain within their extended family network.   Intake services for child protection have been moved back into the province’s eight regions, rather than having them centralized. This is intended to help social workers respond to concerns in a more focused and time-sensitive manner.   Social workers now have access to cell phones with data plans, which help them better support and remain in contact with their clients, supervisors and other social workers.   Consultations have been launched regarding the development of new child welfare legislation to better protect children and promote healthy families.  These projects represent priorities that were selected a year ago because they would have an immediate and significant impact on the lives of social workers and the children they serve. A list of completed projects is available online. As I have said before, we know that working through the report recommendations will take time and a lot of work. However, we are making progress and remain committed to improving our programs and services in order to improve the quality of life for children and families. I look forward to providing further updates on our progress in the future. 24-01-20"

Rental services for snowshoes and cross-country skis will also be available. The facility will also feature interpretive and educational components as well as Indigenous artwork. “The new lodge will provide an exceptional gathering place for all park visitors,” said Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Robert Gauvin. “Mount Carleton Provincial Park will not only offer well-maintained trails for everyone and a strategic place to buy fuel for snowmobilers but will also contribute to our efforts to make New Brunswick a first-choice tourist destination for all seasons.” The new fueling station is being operated by Maliseet Fuels, a business from the Woodstock First Nation, which was selected as the successful proponent following the completion of a public request for proposals process. The station supports the Christmas Mountains Trails Network, an initiative that represents a decade of collaborative work between all levels of government, the First Nations, the New Brunswick Federation of Snowmobile Clubs and several other partners. When completed, it will offer hundreds of kilometres of groomed snowmobile trails. It also contributes to the Northern Odyssey snowmobile experience, a 1,500 km trail network that links the cities of Miramichi, Bathurst, Campbellton and Edmundston, as well as the Chaleur and Acadian Peninsula regions. New Brunswick has more than 8,000 km of snowmobile trails maintained by local branches of the New Brunswick Federation of Snowmobile Clubs. According to the federation, about 21,000 trail permits were sold in 2019, a 9.5 per cent increase from the season before. “Snowmobiling provides significant social and economic benefits to New Brunswick,” said Higgs. “The latest data showed snowmobiling tourism had an economic impact of $32.7 million in 2015, but we know that number is continuing to grow.” Mount Carleton Provincial Park opened for the winter season on Jan. 1 and will remain open until March 31. Special programming such as activities planned for Family Day in February and the official opening of the lodge to the public will be communicated through the Mount Carleton Provincial Park Facebook page. 22-01-20"

Preventative efforts must reflect our unique regional identity.” Understanding the context in which domestic homicides occur in Atlantic Canada is critical to preventative efforts, said Wilson. “Having a network will lead to better prevention efforts and better system response to domestic violence,” she said. New Brunswick has the highest rate of family-related murder suicides in the country, followed by Newfoundland and Labrador. The rate of female domestic homicide victims in Atlantic Canada is higher than the national average. Wilson said the majority of victims of domestic violence and domestic homicide are women and the majority of perpetrators are men. Reviewing these deaths in the context of domestic violence recognizes that many of these deaths are preventable, and may require different system responses, community supports, and policy and legislative changes. Each province has its own unique systems for how to respond, prevent and learn from deaths when they occur. The work of the network will include:  sharing information across jurisdictions on existing system responses and prevention efforts to learn and identify best practices;   establishing a baseline study of trends/current situation in Atlantic Canada;   identifying improvements in system responses to the contributing factors to domestic homicide as well as inform the approaches to case reviews within each jurisdiction;   promote cross-collaboration between government agencies, as well as provide a focal point for gathering input from non-government agencies and individuals; and   promote opportunities to hear from agencies and individuals whose work and lived experiences will provide important context in determining priority areas for intervention to improve service delivery, particularly for vulnerable groups.  22-01-20"

MLAs will provide input and recommendations based on the priorities of their electoral districts. The application process for employers is now open. Employers approved for SEED funding will be notified by March 31 and their job postings will be listed online. Students seeking employment may apply directly to employers using the contact information in each job posting. In 2019, 86 per cent of students who applied to the SEED program reported finding a job without the program’s assistance. Students are also encouraged to apply for federally funded summer jobs, as well as look at employment opportunities on NBjobs.ca. “There is an unprecedented number of jobs available across various sectors in our province and we believe any student looking to find employment should be presented with ample opportunity,” said Holder. “Each summer, the private sector experiences a demand for labour and we believe there is plenty of opportunity to hire a student without involving subsidies.” Any employer having human resource challenges, including recruiting workers, is encouraged to reach out to their regional WorkingNB office and speak to a workforce consultant.     21-01-20"

The commission determined that a price adjustment was necessary based upon increases to the cost of production for dairy farmers on items such as purchased feed, machinery and equipment repairs, fuel and oil, custom work and hired labour. The price adjustment also covers an increase in costs borne by dairy processors, as is reflected by the increase in consumer and industrial indices. Pricing under the School Milk Program will remain unchanged for the current school year. The program has provided significant savings to school children in New Brunswick since 1995. Dairy producers and processors subsidize the program by about $800,000 per year. “New Brunswick dairy producers and processors supply about one million litres of milk to students in kindergarten to Grade 12 each year,” said commission chair Bob Shannon. “I thank the dairy producers and processors for their continued financial support of the New Brunswick School Milk Program. These subsidies ensure children have access to nutritious, high-quality milk, which is essential to their development.” The commission balances the interests of producers, processors and consumers as they set the price of fluid milk products in New Brunswick.   21-01-20"

The grade is an improvement from the C- received in 2018 and is the highest grade the province has received in the past decade. The report cites strong political leadership, comprehensive measures for red tape reduction and the introduction of the Business Navigator Program as contributing to the improved performance. “Red tape reduction is a priority for our premier and our government and today’s report card demonstrates that we have taken action on the number one issue we heard from New Brunswick’s business community and we have delivered results,” said Economic Development and Small Business Minister Mary Wilson, who is also responsible for Opportunities NB. In November, a government-wide initiative was launched to measure and reduce the regulatory burden experienced by businesses, with a target to reduce it by a value of $14 million by March 2021. In addition, a Business Navigator Program was introduced to help businesses spend less time dealing with red tape. Any New Brunswick entrepreneur may call 1-833-799-7966 or email nav@navnb.ca to contact a navigator at Opportunities NB. This team will work with navigators identified within each government department to provide the most accurate and helpful response. The regulatory burden identified in these calls will be tracked and reported to the Chief Regulatory Officer. Although the province received a B grade in 2014, it was one of only two provinces where the cost of regulation was not being reduced by 2018. “We will continue to take an aggressive approach to removing barriers to growth, like red tape, to ensure that anyone who wants to own and operate a business in this province will be doing so in one of the most competitive environments for private sector growth in the country,” said Wilson.

The province received proposals from the following organizations:  Canopy Growth Corp., Ont.;   Fire & Flower Inc., Alta.;   Green Stop Cannabis Ltd., N.S.;   Kiaro Brands Inc., B.C.;   Loblaw Companies Ltd., Ont.;   New Brunswick Association of Cannabis Distributors, N.B.;   RSL NB, N.B.;   YSS Corp., Alta.  In the coming weeks, the proposals will be evaluated through an open, fair and accountable process overseen by a third-party fairness monitor. This exercise could result in the announcement of the successful single private operator in spring 2020, with transition to the new delivery model later this year. The proposals will be evaluated according to the criteria established in the RFP, such as experience in the sale of recreational cannabis, financial capacity, a viable plan to combat the illegal market, consumer protection through price competitiveness and product diversity, and an approach to build strong, direct and indirect partnerships with local entrepreneurs and First Nations. The government will also require a strong financial offer from the successful proponent for the sales rights for cannabis. Once the preferred proponent is identified, the government will enter into negotiations to finalize an agreement. Should the two parties fail to reach an agreement during negotiations, the government can end the process and choose to explore other options. “We will be diligently reviewing the submissions in order to identify the overall best proposal that focuses on public health, education and safety and offers the best value for the New Brunswick taxpayers,” said Steeves.

Since 2017, the department has worked collaboratively to create the conditions necessary to repatriate over 60,000 artifacts in its care to the Metepenagiag Mi’kmaq Nation as soon as they have the appropriate facilities and staffing to curate them. “It is with great honour that we reaffirm our commitment to protect and promote the significant cultural and natural assets and values of the Metepenagiag Mi’kmaq Nation,” said Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Robert Gauvin. “By signing this memorandum of understanding, we are not only strengthening our partnership, but we are also ensuring that the park continues to play an important role in the conservation of community artifacts and as an indigenous tourism, heritage and cultural attraction for our province.” The National Trust for Canada presented the 2018 Governor’s Award to the park and the department’s Archaeological Services Branch for their collaboration in the repatriation of the artifacts. “This is a great day for the Metepenagiag Heritage Park,” said Claude DeGrâce, chairman and manager of the park. “We can now continue our collections research and offer more possibilities to expand and share the knowledge of Metepenagiag’s cultural heritage resources with New Brunswickers and with visitors from all over the world.” The artifacts have been in the care of the provincial government since 1975 and originate from two provincial and national historic sites: Augustine Mound and Oxbow Site.

Called Exercise Brunswick Charlie 2020, the one-day effort will give municipalities, First Nations and local service districts an opportunity to practise their respective roles during an emergency. It is being organized by the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization (NBEMO) with help from the Canadian Armed Forces, through Joint Task Force Atlantic. “We have been seeing more signs that communities are better prepared for emergencies when they occur,” said Public Safety Minister Carl Urquhart. “This is in part because of new resources, such as additional NBEMO regional emergency management co-ordinators who work with local communities, and through regular joint exercises such as Brunswick Charlie.” The exercise will allow community staff involved in emergency management to practise planned responses and other procedures at any level they choose, from simple to complex. The exercise scenario will revolve around severe weather unfolding across the province. Advanced weather reporting, simulated social media, and web-based news reporting will add to the realism of the exercise. It is anticipated that this year’s event will be a simulated severe heat wave culminating with a tropical storm. Further details will be developed and discussed at the initial planning conference in Fredericton on Jan. 14. Municipal, local service district and First Nations participants are invited to take part in the planning over the coming months. Brunswick Charlie can also be an opportunity for local service groups, retirement homes and others to exercise their emergency plans. “The feedback we have received from the first two exercises shows that people are engaged and that they find the experience worthwhile,” said Greg MacCallum, director of the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization. “Participating in the planning process will help ensure they continue to get the kind of test they need so they can be prepared for an emergency.” NBEMO staff provide advice to communities regarding their emergency planning and provides emergency management training, such as a recent emergency operations centre course in Paquetville. The organization also co-ordinates preparedness for emergencies, working at provincial, regional and municipal levels to ensure communities are protected during all phases of an emergency. It also co-ordinates provincial response operations during emergencies and administers disaster financial assistance programs during recovery.

The artist who accompanied the school for the purposes of this creative work is Kathleen Gallant. The painting, reproduced on a rustic door, symbolizes the opening of the new decade. In the centre appears the slogan: Une nouvelle décennie accueille la francophonie! (A new decade welcomes the Francophonie!). At the top is a pocket watch to illustrate the evolution of a whirlwind that shows people of all ages and different cultures highlighting the intergenerational and cultural differences of La Francophonie. The large open hand at the bottom of the poster evokes welcome. The bright colors represent the Francophonie and Acadie. Each spring, the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development launches a contest in francophone schools to select a poster and artwork for Provincial French Pride Week the following year. The week will take place from March 16 to 20. The opening ceremony will take place on March 16 at the École communautaire Ernest-Lang in Haut-Madawaska, Saint-François de Madawaska district. 02-01-20"

It will be updated annually and will increase the effectiveness of the watercourse and wetland alteration permitting process. All other wetland regulations and guidelines still apply and additional information can be found on the department’s website. The website has also been updated to provide a clear description of how wetlands are managed in the province, and to provide information to assist those who may require a Watercourse and Wetland Alteration permit. These changes have been implemented following a period of engagement with First Nations, stakeholders and the public. New Brunswick’s Climate Change Action Plan promotes the use of natural infrastructure such as wetlands, floodplains and saltmarshes to help buffer the effects of climate change. 02-01-20"

The new rules are designed to help these organizations react and adapt to technological and competitive changes. The recently enacted new acts replace outdated legislation and bring New Brunswick in-line with other jurisdictions across Canada, according to the Financial and Consumer Services Commission. “We have been working with these industries on updating these acts for a number of years,” said Étienne LeBoeuf, director of financial institutions at the commission as well as designate superintendent of credit unions and designate inspector of cooperatives. “In bringing forward these changes, we looked at how to improve the effectiveness of the credit union regulatory structure while modernizing both acts to adapt to the realities of changes to technology, to cooperative models, to credit union needs, and to diversity in board membership.” The changes to the Cooperatives Act include:  streamlining the red tape for dealing with regulatory requirements;   improving the ability to use electronic filing for reporting requirements;   allowing the use of different financial instruments to adapt to changing markets; and   making it easy for cooperatives to increase diversity on their boards.  The changes to the Credit Unions Act include:  providing the regulator with rule-making authority to be more responsive to industry changes as well as being in a better position to support their members;   reducing the cost of the regulatory functions without reducing oversight to ensure consumers are protected; and   fostering an environment where credit unions are able to be more competitive in a changing landscape.  On June 14, 2019, the new Credit Union Act and Cooperatives Act received Royal Assent and the rules associated with these acts were publicized in the fall to allow for comments. As of Jan. 1, these two acts and their associated rules are in force and are being administered by the commission. The Financial and Consumer Services Commission has the mandate to protect consumers and enhance public confidence in the financial and consumer marketplace through the provision of regulatory and educational services. It is responsible for the administration and enforcement of provincial legislation that regulates the following sectors: securities, insurance, pensions, credit unions, trust and loan companies, co-operatives, and a wide range of other consumer legislation. It is an independent Crown corporation funded by the regulatory fees and assessments paid by the regulated sectors. Educational tools and resources are available online. 02-01-20"
