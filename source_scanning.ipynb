The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 900 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,277 in the Fraser Health region, 127 in the Island Health region, 195 in the Interior Health region and 63 in the Northern Health region.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths in the last day, for a total of 164 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, 15 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks.“Public health teams continue to provide support for community outbreaks at federal corrections facilities, the processing facilities in the poultry sector and for individuals connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“WorkSafeBC’s COVID-19 guidance has been developed through a collaboration of public health and workplace experts. The comprehensive guidance balances creating opportunities to safely restart many activities and the ability to protect everyone as we do that.“WorkSafeBC is the first stop when looking for the latest information and guidance for your workplace. Check the website frequently or call the WorkSafeBC Prevention Information Line at 1 888 621-SAFE, as new information is added every day: www.worksafebc.com“We commend the federal government’s decision to maintain the restrictions on cruise ships in Canadian waters until October. This is the right thing to do for our country and our province right now to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 into our coastal communities.“Easing restrictions can\\xa0be done only after thoughtful consideration.

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, has issued the following statement on the Delta Hospice Society (DHS):“Fraser Health will stop funding DHS on Feb. 25, 2021, having provided the required 365 days notice to end its service agreement without cause.“The contract had provided DHS approximately $1.5 million annually. This covered 94% of the society’s costs to operate 10 beds at the Irene Thomas Hospice — a facility on land Fraser Health owns.“This decision to end this contract is final and will not change.“DHS can continue to provide hospice services until Feb. 25, 2021, if it complies with the existing contract.“The hospice is regulated under the Community Care and Assisted Living Act (CCALA) and is required to act in accordance with that act. The CCALA requires licensees to operate community care facilities in a manner that will promote the health, safety and dignity and rights of persons in care, make the rights of persons in care known to residents and their families, and to ensure residents' choices are respected and supported. (Sec 2 (a); Sec 7(1)(b)(i)(ii))“Anyone who believes that an operator is not acting in accordance with the CCALA or its regulations may make a complaint to the medical health officer in their region, who is required to investigate the allegations. (Sec 15 (1)(B)(ii))“I have heard concerns from the community about the internal governance of the society. Anyone concerned about governance issues of the society may have remedies available to them under the Societies Act and should consult a lawyer for advice on options available to them. You can read more about these options here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/business/not-for-profit-organizations/societies/resolving-internal-disputes“This is a time when our communities have come together in remarkable ways to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to hospice services are fundamental to people. That’s what I hear regularly from people in Delta and across B.C. That is why there is strong support for the decision we have taken. I think this commitment to hospice can and should bring us together as communities.“Fraser Health’s job, and my job, is to ensure that Delta residents continue to have access to hospice services upon the termination of the contract with DHS. We continue to be committed to this and are working to make it happen.”\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nChanges to B.C.’s tenancy law will provide greater protection to renters who are experiencing violence inside or outside of their home by allowing them to end their tenancy early.“Everyone should feel safe in their home,” said Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity. “With these changes, anyone who experiences violence can make decisions about their housing that are right for them and their loved ones without having to worry about paying extra rent. This change is another step forward for protecting renters in British Columbia and helps people who have experienced violence move to a home where they are safe.”There are existing provisions under the Residential Tenancy Act (RTA) that allow a renter, or their dependent, who has been a victim of family violence to end a tenancy agreement early without financial penalty. Changes are being made to the RTA to include all renters experiencing violence within or outside of the home. If staying in the rental home threatens their own safety or the safety of another occupant, such as a roommate, they will now be eligible to end their tenancy.These changes are the result of a private member’s bill that was passed in 2019 and comes into effect on Saturday, May 30, 2020.“I was pleased to bring this private member’s bill forward,” said Andrew Weaver, independent MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head. “This change will have a significant impact on the people who need it – vulnerable members of our society facing violence in their homes. The unanimous passage of this bill exemplifies how members of the legislature can work across partisan lines to deliver real results for British Columbians.”Under the new legislation, violence includes activities that have or are likely to have a negative effect on the security, safety or physical well-being of a renter, their dependents or other occupant, if they remain in the rental homes. For example, a person living in a rental home who is being harassed or threatened by someone they know, or a stranger, may be able to end their rental agreement without financial penalty.“The BC Green Party caucus is proud to have advanced such an important bill in collaboration with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing,” said interim third-party Leader Adam Olsen. “A safe home is essential to the well-being of survivors of violence – nobody should have to live in close proximity to their perpetrator. These changes are particularly timely, as the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of household violence and limited the social and financial supports available to people needing to leave an unsafe situation. Thank you to the stakeholders who guided and supported our work throughout the drafting process.”Secure housing and ensuring fairness for renters and landlords are shared priorities between government and the BC Green Party caucus and are\\xa0part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nThe change to the Residential Tenancy Act builds on actions taken by government to improve B.C.’s rental housing system, including:\\nclosing the fixed-term lease loophole and eliminating the geographic rent increase clause;\\ncutting the annual allowable rent increase by 2%, limiting it to inflation;\\nchanging the laws to increase compensation for renters for bad-faith evictions;\\nmaking it easier for renters to receive their security and pet deposits back in a fair and timely manner;\\nimproving the Rental Assistance Program and Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters to give families and seniors on fixed income a break from rising costs; and\\ninvesting $6.8 million in new funding to the Residential Tenancy Branch to reduce wait times for tenancy disputes and to establish a new compliance unit to take action against serious offenders.\\n\\nLearn More:For a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.29_NR_Protection_for_Renters_Experiencing_Violence-Chinese.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.29_NR_Protection_for_Renters_Experiencing_Violence-Punjabi.pdfA list of authorized third-party verifiers can be found in the Residential Tenancy Regulations: http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/477_2003#section39For more information on the changes to the Residential Tenancy Act, visit:\\xa0https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies/ending-a-tenancy/ending-a-tenancy-in-special-circumstances/family-violence-or-long-term-careThe Residential Tenancy Act can be found here: http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/02078_01\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe Government of B.C. has purchased a new building to help people who were displaced by the recent fire at the Pacific West complex in Campbell River.“We know that finding affordable housing is challenging, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Claire Trevena, MLA for North Island. “This purchase and resulting new units will provide security, stability and peace of mind for people in Campbell River who lost their homes during the April fire, while we continue to work with our partners to build more affordable housing for others in need of a place to call home.”The Province, through BC Housing, has purchased the former Heritage River Inn, located at 2140 Island Highway in Campbell River. With the purchase of the Heritage River Inn, BC Housing is now able to provide 41 units of stable, long-term, affordable rental housing for low-income individuals displaced by the fire.Over the past month, some households have been able to secure new housing, but the remaining households will soon begin moving into the former inn. The building has a mix of one- and two-bedroom apartments. All units are expected to be occupied in the coming weeks.Since April, BC Housing has provided temporary housing at a local hotel and daily meals to people displaced by the fire. The John Howard Society, Sasamans Society and the City of Campbell River also have provided daily support and assistance to help people find alternate housing.\\xa0“From the beginning, provincial resources and community social service agencies have been key in helping people feel safe and secure following the fire and the loss of their homes,” said Andy Adams, mayor, City of Campbell River. “With BC Housing purchasing this property and making affordable rental housing available to these people, some of the urgent need for shelter in Campbell River’s extremely limited rental market will be relieved. On behalf of council and our community, we are very appreciative of the support and quick action and look forward to continuing to work closely with BC Housing on other long-term solutions to meet the demand for local supportive and affordable housing.”In the coming weeks, a service provider will be selected to operate the new site and oversee day-to-day management of the building. Residents will gradually start moving in over the coming weeks. BC Housing may consider redeveloping the site in the future, but at this time does not have a proposal or timeline in place. If that were to occur, BC Housing would engage the community and go through the municipal approval process.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nThe Province purchased the Heritage River Inn for $4.08 million through funding from the Building BC program.\\nResidents will pay monthly rent, which will be set at 30% of the household’s income.\\nIn addition to this project, the Province has invested in two other new housing projects, totalling 76 new units, which are underway in Campbell River. Those projects include:\\n49 units for women and children leaving violence; and\\n27 units for low- to moderate-income households.\\n\\nLearn More:For more information on how BC Housing is supporting British Columbians during the COVID-19 outbreak, visit:\\nhttps://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19/A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online:\\nhttps://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit:\\nhttps://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Through programs like Bee BC, we are ensuring the health of honey bees for future generations.”The Bee BC program provides funding to regional and community-based projects that support the health of B.C.’s bees. The fund provides support to research, explore, field test and share information about best management practices associated with bee health, with the latest funding supporting 15 new projects throughout B.C.\"The support of the grant from Bee BC allows us to cultivate 2.5 acres of our grass covered farm land into diverse forage for bees, which is really needed in the Powell River region,” said Darcy Kaltio, affiliate member, Blueberry Commons Farm Cooperative. “It\\'s going to be beautiful! The educational signage will be an easy way for visitors to our farm to learn how they, too, can plant bee forage plants at home.\"Blueberry Commons Farm Cooperative in Powell River is planting one hectare (2.5 acres) with diverse forage crops for pollinators, and holding tours and engaging with schools and community groups to promote the importance of increasing forage for honey bees and pollinators. The funding will also help support a mentoring program for beekeeping in their community.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In Victoria, beekeeper Evan Machin is comparing the overwintering survival rate between a Langstroth hive, a hive constructed by stacking rectangular boxes with removable frames for the bees to build comb in, and a natural-style hive made by bees.

Plans may differ by location and courthouse configuration.As part of these assessments, additional health and safety measures being considered include, but are not limited to:\\nreconfiguring and removing furniture to open space in courtrooms and to keep people physically distant from one another;\\nadjusting maximum occupant levels to account for physical distancing requirements;\\nmarking floors to indicate the directional flow of movement and places to stand while maintaining appropriate physical distancing at the registry, in elevators and washrooms, and inside courtrooms and courthouses;\\nposting clear and visible signage throughout the courthouse and courtrooms to ensure court personnel and users are aware of and are able to follow health and safety protocols;\\nverbally screening court personnel and users for COVID-19 symptoms or exposure prior to entering court environments;\\nestablishing protocols for handling documents and evidence;\\ninstalling hand sanitizer stations at courthouse entrances, outside courtrooms and in elevator lobbies;\\nplacing hand sanitizer bottles in courtrooms at the dais, counsel desks, the witness stand and the clerk's desk;\\ndisinfecting courtrooms after use; and\\nfrequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces in courtrooms and in public areas throughout the courthouses.\\nThe ministry is in the process of meeting with stakeholders, including judges, counsel, court managers and others, to make recommendations and implement changes necessary to keep the public safe when attending court.\\xa0This work is occurring now, with the expectation that within the next few weeks, a limited number of courtrooms will be available throughout the province for in-person hearingsThe ministry has also been working to increase technology enhancements outlined in the Court Digital Transformation Strategy. This includes continued expansion of technology for virtual hearings in cases where it is deemed appropriate.In addition, the Province has also established two advisory groups to help government support courts and tribunals in delivering services as effectively as possible during the pandemic, and in minimizing\\xa0its impact on the justice system.Learn More: For more information on the justice system advisory groups:\\nhttps://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0032-000747For more information on the ministry’s response to COVID-19:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/covid19For more information on the ministry’s digital transformation strategy:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/law-crime-and-justice/about-bc-justice-system/justice-reform-initiatives/digital-transformation-strategy-bc-courts.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

Farm, Fish and Food Job Connector will showcase current job vacancies throughout the province, including those for crop and seafood harvesters, food processing and farm workers, agrologists, large machinery operators and marketing specialists. The site also has sector-specific information and guidance to support businesses as they adapt their recruitment and human resource management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.“Many British Columbians are passionate about buying local and are looking towards careers in the agricultural, seafood and food processing sectors. We are making it easier for employers and employees to connect so we can fill vacancies and get more British Columbians working to put fresh and local food on our tables,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “At the same time, we recognize the workforce challenges brought on by COVID-19 and are helping to address the need to establish a secure agricultural labour force so we can generate economic activity and maintain food security in our communities.”The connector site will also provide information and context about the opportunities that exist within the different regions of B.C.’s agriculture, seafood and food processing businesses and will highlight the available jobs.“Farmers in B.C. are in a tough spot because of COVID-19, and our need for labour is at the top of the list,” said Jason Smith, owner of Fraser Berry Farms Ltd. “I appreciate the B.C. government’s efforts in responding to those concerns through this website, which I’m hoping will introduce my farm and family to people looking to join our business and help us share our great tasting, healthy berries with British Columbians this season.”Parm Bains, owner, Westberry Farms, said: “B.C. berry growers are facing a serious labour shortage this season due to COVID-19, and this website is a good idea to let people know we are hiring and looking for their help. The berry industry urgently needs seasonal workers interested in harvesting and packing jobs. Many farms also have longer-term positions available in field and crop management and quality control, and this site could connect us to those people.”The site will connect to agriculture, food processing, aquaculture and marine fisheries jobs posted on Work BC, industry sites and the BC Food and Beverage websites. It will also be a centralized source to find information and tools provided by B.C.’s industry groups.“Local labour has always been a critical part of British Columbia’s food system. Jobs in agriculture provide countless opportunities to grow your skills, expand your experiences and contribute to our sustainable food system,” said Rhonda Driediger, president, Western Agriculture Labour Initiative. “We appreciate the work that the Province is doing to help farmers and ranchers connect with those looking for employment opportunities during these changing times.”The B.C. Farm, Fish and Food Job Connector site can be found at: www.bcagjobs.gov.bc.caQuick Facts:\\nJobs are available in more than 30 communities in the Fraser Valley, Okanagan, Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island, as well as in the Kootenays, Cariboo and northern B.C.\\nThere are close to 600 jobs posted on WorkBC in the agriculture, seafood and food and beverage sectors.\\nB.C. farms, ranches, seafood and food processing companies generated a record $15 billion in revenue in 2018.\\nLearn More:For information about Buy BC, visit: https://buybc.gov.bc.ca/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

This new funding supports that work.”A call for proposals will be posted on the DABC website in summer 2020, and grants will be awarded by the end of the year. Last year, 14 organizations received funding for accessibility projects in their communities.“Disability Alliance BC is thrilled to be distributing another round of grants to community organizations across B.C. to promote accessibility and inclusion in the province,” said Justina Loh, executive director of DABC. “In the past two years, we have seen some very innovative and creative projects come to life, and we have seen the number of people impacted by these community projects. We look forward to supporting more organizations across the province and hope that new organizations apply for funding this year.”Projects can include accessible education and learning, sports and recreation, arts, culture and tourism, community participation, emergency planning and response, and accessible employment.The Province proclaimed May 31 to June 6, 2020, as B.C.’s third AccessAbility week\\xa0to promote inclusion and accessibility, and to recognize the people and organizations who are working to make B.C. a more inclusive and welcoming province for people with disabilities.

       "  '\\n\\nThe provincial state of emergency is being extended an additional two weeks to support continued co-ordination of B.C.’s COVID-19 response.\\xa0\\xa0“We are now in the longest state of emergency in our province’s history, and British Columbians everywhere have shown we have what it takes to persevere through these challenging times,” said Premier John Horgan. “As we slowly turn the dial on our social and economic activity, we must work together to do so in a way that keeps our communities and loved ones safe in the weeks and months to come.”Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, is extending the state of emergency as B.C. begins to safely and carefully restart the province. B.C. is now in Phase 2 of its Restart Plan, which lays out a series of steps and principles that everyone must follow to protect people and ensure the province can come back from COVID-19 stronger than before.“As businesses work hard to safely reopen their doors and friends and families carefully expand their social bubbles, we are beginning to see what this global challenge will look like in B.C.,” Farnworth said. “Our government is committed to supporting people and businesses for the long road ahead, and we will continue to find ways to keep the economy moving and keep people safe.”The current state of emergency is being extended through the end of the day on June 9, 2020. During the past two weeks of the provincial state of emergency, government has taken action to support British Columbians by:\\nwelcoming the release of the initial set of WorkSafeBC guidelines that will help businesses and organizations develop their plans to reopen safely during Phase 2 of BC’s Restart Plan;\\nhelping the province’s hospitality sector by temporarily authorizing the expansion of service areas, such as patios, to support physical distancing requirements and industry recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic;\\nsupporting people working on the front lines in B.C.’s health-care system, social services and corrections by providing temporary COVID-19 pandemic pay as part of a cost-shared program with the federal government;\\nannouncing that parents will have the choice to bring their children back to class on a part-time basis this school year as part of BC’s Restart Plan, with the goal of returning to full-time classes in September 2020; and\\nsupporting people who were living in encampments in Victoria at Topaz Park and on Pandora Avenue to move into secured temporary accommodations, with wraparound supports to protect their health and safety.\\nThe extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency the previous day.Quick Facts:\\nDeclarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.\\nThe provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of up to 14 days at a time.\\nThe current state of emergency is the longest in B.C.’s history, surpassing the 2017 wildfire season when the province was in a state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.\\nLearn More:For information on BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/RestartBC \\xa0\\xa0For information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19For information on federal and provincial government supports available to individuals, families, businesses and organizations, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covidgovernmentbenefitsFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, including for employers, businesses and schools, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For a French translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.27_NR_State_of_Emergency_Extended-FR.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nPeople\\xa0living in Surrey will now have better access to same-day urgent and primary care with the opening of a second new urgent and primary care centre (UPCC) in Newton.“The new Surrey urgent and primary care centre will connect people who don’t have a family doctor with the health care they need,” said Premier John Horgan. “This is one of 17 urgent and primary care centres opened in communities around the province, along with new and upgraded hospitals and primary care networks that will deliver better, faster health care to all British Columbians.”The\\xa0Surrey-Newton Urgent and Primary Care Centre, located at 6830 King George Blvd., is operated by Fraser Health. It was developed in close collaboration with the Surrey-North Delta Division of Family Practice, which assisted in the clinic’s design and planning.Whalley is the home of Surrey’s first urgent and primary care centre, which opened in November 2018.The Surrey-Newton Urgent and Primary Care Centre will offer same-day care for people who need health care within 12 to 24 hours\\xa0but do not require an emergency department, such as people with sprains, cuts, high fevers and minor infections.The centre is initially open Monday to Friday from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. Beginning in July, it will provide both long-term planned primary care services and urgent primary care services, 12 hours a day, seven days a week, like other UPCCs in the province.Starting in July, the centre will support regular, day-to-day care for people who do not have a primary care provider. It will also help residents who lack a primary care provider to easily access services and find ongoing primary care through a regular family doctor or a nurse practitioner.\\xa0“We are listening to people in B.C., and that is why we are delivering on our primary care strategy to meet the health-care needs of a rapidly growing and aging population,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “With this new centre, we are helping thousands of people who do not have a family doctor get their daily health-care needs met and help secure a primary care provider.”Dr.\\xa0Victoria Lee, president and CEO, Fraser Health, said, “Fraser Health is excited about improving access to care for more people in the region. This second Surrey urgent and primary care centre will provide patients with much-needed comprehensive and team-based care services close to home.”A team of health-care workers will join the centre, including family physicians, nurse practitioners and registered nurses, as well as allied health providers (pharmacist, social worker and clinical counsellor) and support staff.This\\xa0is the 17th urgent and primary care centre to be announced under the government’s primary care strategy and is the fifth in the Fraser Health region, following North Surrey, Burnaby, Ridge-Meadows and Abbotsford.Quotes:Harry\\xa0Bains, MLA for Surrey-Newton – “Surrey is one of the fastest growing communities in B.C. This new urgent and primary care centre will help take demand off Surrey Memorial Hospital’s emergency department.”Jinny Sims, MLA for Surrey-Panorama – “As a resident of Surrey, I’ve heard families say they need more options for their daily health-care needs. I am confident this centre will provide convenient access to health care when and where residents need it.”Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC –“We look forward to the new urgent and primary care centre to provide Surrey residents with more timely access to health-care services while supporting important long-term relationships and continuity of care that result in better health outcomes for patients.”Dr. Elaine Jackson, co-chair, board of directors, Surrey-North Delta Division of Family Practice –“The Surrey-North Delta Division is supportive of this provincewide effort to improve access to quality health care and values the opportunity to partner with Fraser Health in the co-design of the service delivery model for this UPCC. This Surrey UPCC will serve patients who have difficulties accessing primary care, particularly after hours. It will strengthen the existing network of primary care services in the community and will create an alternative employment opportunity for family physicians and health-care teams willing to provide care in Surrey.”Jacqollyne Keath, board chair, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC –“Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC are pleased to see that a team-based approach to care taps into the expertise of all health-care staff. We believe that this approach is key to ensuring B.C. families can access timely health-care services when they need them, and we are excited about the opening of another urgent and primary care centre in B.C.\"Quick Facts:\\nPrimary care is the day-to-day health care given by a health-care provider.\\nUrgent primary care is the care that people need within 12 to 24 hours for non-life-threatening conditions such as sprains, urinary problems, ear infections, minor cuts or burns.\\nUrgent and primary care centres are part of a comprehensive strategy to transform B.C.’s health system by bringing together and co-ordinating with health-care providers, services and programs to make it easier for people to access care, receive followup and connect to other services they may need.\\nLearn More:To learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043For a Punjabi translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.27_NR_Second_Care_Centre_Surrey-Punjabi.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe next round of funding for the Hazelnut Renewal program is now available, helping B.C. hazelnut growers replace trees and establish new orchards with disease-resistant varieties.“We are now in third year of this successful program and it has been very popular with hazelnut growers looking to replace their orchards with eastern blight resistant varieties,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Our goal from the beginning was to offer a program that provides accessibility and flexibility for farmers, and the results are encouraging.”In the first two years of the Hazelnut Renewal program, 18,444 new trees were planted over 34 hectares (94 acres). At the same time, 4,795 infected trees were removed over 17 hectares (42 acres). In B.C., commercial production of hazelnuts is centred in the eastern Fraser Valley, mainly around Chilliwack and Agassiz, though there are orchards in the southern Interior and on Vancouver Island.In 2018, the B.C. government provided the BC Hazelnut Growers Association with $300,000 over three years to help growers expand hazelnut acreage in B.C. by replacing dead and diseased orchards with new, eastern filbert blight resistant trees. The program is accepting new applications until Sept. 15, 2020, for fall planting and removal.“The Hazelnut Renewal program has supported the renewal of our industry as we continue to work towards sustainability,” said Neal teBrink, president, BC Hazelnut Growers Association. “From the Fraser Valley to the Okanagan and on Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, we are continuing to plant new, healthy hazelnut trees and are excited for the future.”Ned Bell, an executive chef,\\xa0said: “When I create and build my dishes with B.C. hazelnuts, I know that it represents the end of a valued and\\xa0valuable farm-to-table journey that begins in the orchard with the hard work of our local growers. B.C. hazelnuts are an incredible product, and I love showcasing locally grown, fished and harvested food in my recipes.”Hazelnuts are a species of tree in the Corylus family and are often referred to as filberts. There are several native species in North America but the European hazelnut is the primary species grown commercially.Quick Facts:\\nThe B.C. hazelnut industry is comprised of approximately 40 growers with about 141 hectares (350 acres).\\nThe Hazelnut Renewal program allows a maximum eligible acreage planting of four hectares (10 acres) for double (maximum 269 trees/acre) or single density planning, and eight hectares (20 acres) exclusively for single density planting (maximum 132 trees/acre) per farm operation.\\nThe hazelnut is a small brown oval nut that varies in size depending on the variety.\\nHazelnuts grow in clusters of one to six nuts, each covered by a shell and a husk that encases the nut. When the nut is ripe, the husk of some species and varieties releases the nut, while in others the husk must be picked and mechanically separated from the nuts.\\nThe kernel of the nut is edible and used raw or roasted, and as an ingredient in many commercial, baked and culinary products.\\nLearn More:For more information about the Hazelnut Renewal Program, visit:\\xa0https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/programs/hazelnut-renewal-program\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

In total, 14 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks.“Public health teams continue to provide support for community outbreaks at federal corrections facilities, the processing facilities in the poultry sector\\xa0and for individuals connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“We know that COVID-19 continues to be in all of our communities and will be for some time. We also know that transmission occurs when in close contact with others, so the measures we have in place are the best things we can do to slow the spread of the virus.“While we have worked hard to flatten our curve, as we increase our social interactions and spend more time with others, we may see an increase in new cases. This is because the illness often can be mild or asymptomatic in the early stages, which means people may not realize they are sick.“The faster we can identify and trace new cases, the better we will all be – especially as we ease restrictions.“Public health contact tracing follows the transmission trail to quickly alert close contacts to take precautions and break the chain.“We can help our public health teams and support each other by keeping our household bubbles small. We can also do our own ‘contact tracing’ by paying attention to where we are going each day and who we are seeing.“As we go forward, our ‘new normal’ is different and will be for some time. We all have a role to play to be successful in B.C. and it relies on our shared commitment and effort.

       "  '\\n\\nDowntown Eastside (DTES) residents will use their knowledge of the community, while gaining valuable skills and paid work experience to support their fellow residents, though $200,000 from the Canada-BC Workforce Development Agreement.Known as “peers”, these resident trainees will benefit from a new grassroots approach to peer support.“Community-driven support for the well-being of our most vulnerable residents is one way we are responding to a call to action from advocates and residents in the Downtown Eastside,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Our government knows that ‘peers’ are best equipped to use their lived experience and understanding to meet residents where they’re at and link them to the services they need to stay healthy during these unprecedented times. By working with a respected grassroots organization like EMBERS, we are building on existing skills training for employment programming and making sure peers have the resources they need to succeed.” \\xa0The group of peers will provide support to other members of the DTES community, including services\\xa0such as physical distancing support on cheque-issue days, information about government supports and other available resources, and sanitation.“Peer support workers have overcome adversity to build a better life for themselves and their families,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “By developing skills that draw on their lived experience to support people in overcoming those same hardships, they play a valuable role on the front lines of the fight against poverty and homelessness in British Columbia.”The Eastside Movement for Business and Economic Renewal Society (EMBERS) delivers a variety of skills training for employment programs in the DTES and will work with several DTES peer network organizations that have been successful in the pilot to identify peers who could be included in the project.“Peers helping peers is a way to create employment for people who do not fit mainstream jobs. Peer work recognizes the value of life experience itself, which can be drawn upon to support others who may face similar barriers and life challenges,” said Marcia Nozick, CEO of EMBERS. “Peer employment provides more than income. It builds self-esteem, creates a sense of purpose and gives people skills and work experience that can help move them toward a better future.”Up to 40 peers will be supported over six months, with the goal of moving them to more permanent training opportunities and employment. Peers will be encouraged and supported to leverage their community experience to empower them to find employment opportunities that resonate with who they are.EMBERS will also gather valuable community insights of residents to understand the lived experiences of people in the Downtown Eastside. This will help inform government about other tools needed to support vulnerable people to stay safe, strengthen community connections and build their capacity for employment readiness.Quick Facts:\\nPeers were first identified and trained through a pilot project funded by the City of Vancouver and co-ordinated by the Community Impact Real Estate Society, working with more than 40 DTES charities and not-for-profit organizations.\\nPeer support workers have shared life experiences, culture, identities and perspectives on mental health, substance use, homelessness, poverty, sex work and intergenerational trauma. Peers can provide safe, welcoming and more culturally responsive supports to vulnerable DTES residents.\\nEMBERS is a social enterprise and registered community economic development charity located in the DTES.\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThere is more help on the way for survivors of sexual assault through a three-year, $10-million grant program to support the delivery of co-ordinated emergency sexual assault response services in regions throughout B.C.“Gender-based violence, including sexual assault, can increase during times of crisis, and that’s why our government continues to prioritize services and supports for survivors of these devastating crimes,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “This grant program will help organizations throughout the province provide sexual assault survivors with swift access to compassionate and comprehensive care.”The Ending Violence Association of BC (EVA BC) has received the funding to administer the grant program, in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, the Ministry of Finance - Gender Equity Office and the Minister’s Advisory Council on Indigenous Women (MACIW). This grant program will help organizations deliver community-based emergency sexual assault response services that are trauma informed and culturally appropriate. The services will meet the needs of sexual assault survivors around the province, including the unique needs of Indigenous communities and survivors.Sexual assault disproportionately impacts women, girls and LGBTQ2S+ people. Indigenous women and girls are especially at risk of being targeted.EVA BC is a longstanding anti-violence organization, supporting community co-ordination in responding to violence against women. It also provides information, training and support to community-based victim service programs, Stopping the Violence counselling programs and outreach and multicultural outreach programs throughout the province. Given its expertise and knowledge of the victim service and anti-violence sector, along with the relationships the organization has with service providers, EVA BC is well positioned to administer this grant program.The Province funds a range of services to support victims of sexual violence and provides more than $40 million in annual funding to support over 400 victim service and violence against women programs throughout the province. In addition, the Province recently introduced amendments to the Employment Standards Act to provide up to five days paid leave for people facing domestic or sexual violence, improving on the supports for working people introduced in 2019 that gave employees 10 days unpaid leave.Quotes:Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity – “Sexual assault strikes at the heart of a person’s sense of safety and autonomy. It can cause lifelong trauma if people can’t access the supports they need to heal. I’ve worked supporting people who have faced violence for most of my career and I know first-hand that it’s essential for people who have been sexually assaulted to have the services they need when they need them.”Tracy Porteous, executive director, EVA BC – “For the past 18 years, EVA BC has been in dialogue with the Province about the status of sexual assault response in B.C. and the need for specific services for survivors. Sexual assault is considered the most under-reported, violent crime in Canada, and while other violent crime is on the decline, sexual assault is on the rise. Early intervention, as well as emotional and practical support for survivors, have proven to be lifesaving. This move today by our government will provide survivors with the emergency care they need to begin to heal, and we look most forward to working with community anti-violence services, Indigenous communities and the Province to further the network of support for survivors in B.C.”Elba Bendo, director of law reform, West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF) –“Community-based sexual assault programs play an essential role in supporting survivors of sexual assault – especially those who face barriers to accessing health care, justice and other government supports. West Coast LEAF, alongside partner organizations EVA BC, YWCA Metro Vancouver, Women Against Violence Against Women and Victoria Sexual Assault Centre, have long been advocating for these essential services to receive dedicated, sustainable and adequate funding. Today’s funding announcement is a welcome step in the right direction and has the potential to significantly improve access to justice for survivors of sexual assault.”Barbara Ward-Burkitt, chair, MACIW – “A recent survey and consultation by the Native Women’s Association of Canada suggests that many Indigenous women and girls have indicated they are more concerned about gender-based violence during the COVID-19 pandemic than the virus itself. This ongoing violence against Indigenous women and girls compromises the health, safety, well-being and self-respect of its victims. Violence against Indigenous women and girls in itself is a pandemic across our country and it is continuing to grow. It is critically important for MACIW to continue to work in consultation with the Province to ensure that the voices of Indigenous women and girls are being heard as we work collaboratively to improve the health, safety and wellness of Indigenous women and girls.”Learn More:To learn more about EVA BC, visit: https://endingviolence.org/To learn more about West Coast LEAF, visit: http://www.westcoastleaf.org/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

It is estimated that the program could support up to 1,200 jobs for British Columbians, many of them within the northeast region of the province.On April 17, 2020, the Government of Canada announced $120 million in funding for B.C. to support the clean up of oil and gas sites. The Province rolled out three new programs on May 19, 2020, to bring this funding to B.C. industry.The $100 million in funding allocated to the Dormant Sites Reclamation program will provide successful applicants with up to $100,000, or 50% of total costs, whichever is less, for dormant site clean up projects. The program is split into two phases of $50 million each. Applications for the second half will open on November 1, 2020. Of the remaining federal funding, $15 million is going to the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission’s (BCOGC) Orphan Sites Supplemental Reclamation program, and $5 million to the Legacy Sites Reclamation program.These programs are open to oil and gas field service companies and contractors based in B.C., with registration, office and operations in B.C.Learn More:For information on the Dormant Sites Reclamation program, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-gas-oil/responsible-oil-gas-development/dormant-sites-reclamation-programTo find out more about the BCOGC’s management of Orphan Sites in B.C., visit:\\xa0https://bcogc.ca/public-zone/orphan-site-management\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

In the last 24 hours, we have had a further seven new cases.“This represents 12 new cases since we reported on Saturday, for a total of 2,530 cases in British Columbia.“There are 267 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 2,102 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 37 individuals are hospitalized, seven of whom are in intensive care.

Our food supply is safe, including products from facilities where there have been outbreaks of COVID-19.“We are monitoring the situation in B.C. and in other areas closely as we continue to chart our path forward. The key to our success in Phase 2 is all of us working together.“Today is also the start of B.C. Paramedic Services Week. We want to recognize these emergency first responders who are an integral part of our health response, including to both public health emergencies we are facing in B.C. These specialists are with us from the moment we call 911, to when we get to hospital, as part of the network of health professionals helping to protect us. They are active in supporting health care in communities across B.C. through the Community Paramedicine program.“In step with these efforts, public health teams continue to test, trace and track the spread of COVID-19 to quickly put out hot spots, as our front-line health workers provide the care we may need.“While scheduled surgeries have returned and other health professions restart their activities, our COVID-19 health response remains in place and will remain at the ready, should the need arise.“As individuals, we must also continue to do our part.

       "  '\\n\\nThe tourism industry is a major economic engine and job creator for people in British Columbia.Despite the deep and sudden impacts of COVID-19 on the sector, B.C.’s tourism leaders were quick to put the greater good of our communities above anything else.To assist in the pandemic response, many hotels throughout the province swiftly transitioned from welcoming guests to creating safe shelter for front-line workers and people without a place to call home. Workers at the Vancouver Conference Centre sprang into action and transformed that facility into a temporary hospital. Destination marketing organizations pivoted to showcase their communities online and encouraged people to visit later.It’s this kind of leadership that has allowed our province to quickly get the pandemic under control and to start laying the groundwork for recovery.As minister responsible for tourism, I know that every corner of B.C. has incredible places to enjoy and explore – and that it’s the people who work in the tourism and hospitality industry who make travel experiences so special.To help the industry be ready for recovery, we’re providing $10 million in grants to 59 community destination marketing organizations to support their efforts to show British Columbians the amazing travel opportunities available right here at home.In 2018, British Columbians spent an estimated $6.7 billion on international travel, excluding day trips to the United States. This is almost as much as the $6.9 billion international travellers spent in B.C. that same year. Redirecting what we spend abroad toward the tourism sector in B.C. can be a strong first step towards recovery that will create jobs, support local economies and allow the sector to get back to being one of our province’s biggest economic drivers.Destination BC is also working hard to help the tourism sector recover through its three-phased marketing recovery plan: Response, Recovery and Resilience. Its #explorebclocal campaign invites people to explore local experiences and visit businesses close to home.We’re already seeing a groundswell of support from British Columbians to support local businesses – from choosing to shop main street via storefront pickup, to ordering made-in-B.C. products online, to cooking more at home using local ingredients.As we mark the beginning of Tourism Week, let’s all make a commitment and a plan to support B.C.’s tourism industry in 2020 and rediscover the beauty in our own backyards. You will be amazed at what’s right around the corner.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nFifty-nine B.C. community destination marketing organizations (DMOs) severely impacted by COVID-19 travel restrictions will be supported with a $10-million grant from the Province.B.C.’s community DMOs are not-for-profit organizations that promote tourism to their regions. They rely on funds generated by the municipal and regional district tax (MRDT), which is charged to visitors by hotels and other types of accommodation. Without this relief funding, community DMOs would be unable to operate and support economic recovery efforts in the tourism sector.“The tourism industry is a major economic engine and job creator for people in B.C., but the impacts of COVID 19 have left the industry struggling,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “We are supporting the tourism industry today to make sure we can welcome visitors to explore Super, Natural British Columbia when it is safe to do so.”Community DMOs play an important role connecting visitors to B.C.’s communities, representing both large metropolitan centres and towns of a few hundred residents. Investments in the tourism sector’s recovery now will help create jobs and spur economic growth throughout the province.“As we look onwards to reopening and restarting the visitor economy, community DMOs are well placed to create effective marketing and development campaigns that will drive visitors to their communities across our beautiful province,” said Nancy Small, chair, BC Destination Marketing Organization Association. “This welcomed funding accouncement will give many of us that ability to remain operating and plan for the future. It is excellent news.”This funding will help MRDT-supported\\xa0community DMOs retain crucial staff positions and offset fixed expenses from May to October 2020.“Destination BC is eager to support our community partners on tourism’s road to recovery,” said Marsha Walden, president and CEO, Destination BC. “From marketing, to destination development and industry learning, we’re here to help restart the tourism industry as we slowly begin opening our doors again.”Quick Facts:\\nIn 2018, tourism contributed over $20.5 billion in revenues to\\xa0B.C.'s economy.\\nB.C. tourism supports families in communities and rural areas throughout the province, and 59 community DMOs use the MRDT for tourism marketing projects and programs in British Columbia.\\nLearn More:For more information on the municipal and regional district tax, visit: https://www.destinationbc.ca/what-we-do/funding-sources/mrdt/faq/\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe 2020 summer camping season has arrived, giving people in B.C. more opportunities to get outside and connect with nature as most provincial campgrounds and recreation sites open June 1, along with more parks for day-use activities.To ensure British Columbians have access to camping opportunities close to home during the summer, new reservations can only be made by B.C. residents. People can now reserve a site two months in advance of their arrival date instead of four – a temporary measure to spread out the demand during the busy summer months.“Spending time appreciating nature is one of the best things we can do for our health and well-being,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Camping provides the ideal opportunity to connect safely with family and friends in BC Parks beauty. We want to ensure British Columbians have access to summer vacation opportunities close to home, so we are limiting new reservations to B.C. residents. Our plan is to safely open as many parks as possible so that B.C. campers and day visitors can rediscover the wilderness beauty close to home.”Opening\\xa0campgrounds safely to support public health guidelines means it will not be business as usual in some campgrounds. To allow physical distancing, fewer sites will be available in some campgrounds, there may be some changes to services and communal facilities, and some campgrounds will open at a later date. Hot springs, backcountry communal cabins and campgrounds that require visitors to use shared cooking facilities will remain temporarily closed, along with group campsites.As part of the ongoing campsite expansion program, the Province has also added 180 new campsites to BC Parks and recreation sites. Since 2017, more than 1,200 campsites have been added.“COVID-19 changed a lot of our travel plans this summer, but camping locally in BC Parks or recreation sites might be the break you need,” said Joss Penny, chair of the Camping and RVing Coalition BC. “I welcome the news of 180 new campsites in provincial parks and recreation sites to boost capacity and to help ease some of the pressure of locating places to stay in high-demand locations.”As of May 25, the Discover Camping reservation system is back online to accept new reservations. Most existing reservations for dates after June 1 will be honoured, so campsites in popular campgrounds may already be booked. Some reservations may need to be cancelled due to reduced capacity at certain campgrounds. Those who are impacted will be advised of their cancelled bookings over the coming weeks. A list of changes to campgrounds will be posted on the BC Parks website.On June 1, additional parks will reopen for day-use activities. Playgrounds, halls and picnic shelters remain closed in all provincial parks. The remaining parks that attract the largest crowds will only reopen when it is safe to do so, taking into consideration the safety of visitors and staff, impact on nearby communities and the protection of the environment.To ensure parks stay open and safe for everyone, visitors are expected to follow physical distancing requirements and will need to manage their own safety. If a park is too busy and physical distancing cannot be maintained, visitors using parks for day-use activities are asked to find another outdoor space to enjoy close to home.Parks that remain temporarily closed are listed on the BC Parks website. People are advised to check the website often, as services and openings may change to align with the status of the COVID-19 response.Quick Facts:\\nBC Parks is one of the world’s biggest and most diverse parks systems, with 1,035 provincial parks, recreation areas, protected areas, conservancies and ecological reserves covering more than 14% of the province’s land base.\\nDuring\\xa0the last three years, 1,205 new campsites have been added to provincial parks and recreation sites throughout the province. A total of 594 new sites were added last year in regions with the highest demand – the Lower Mainland, Thompson-Okanagan, Kootenay Rockies and Mount Robson.\\nOf\\xa0the 10,700 campsites BC Parks manages, approximately 55% are reservable and 45% remain available on a first-come, first-served basis.\\nLearn More:For status updates on BC Parks closures, visit: http://bcparks.ca/For status updates on Recreation Sites and Trails BC, visit: http://www.sitesandtrailsbc.ca/To reserve a BC Parks campsite, visit:\\xa0https://www.discovercamping.ca/bccweb/For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\xa0\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nFor many British Columbians, daily life has changed significantly because of COVID-19.As the province moves further towards a new normal, Heather Briese, an early childhood educator (ECE) at Rainbow Parent Participation preschool in Burnaby, is looking back at how she found new ways to support children and families during the height of the pandemic.“These children and their families have become part of my family, so it was important to me that they knew I was still thinking about them,” Briese said, who mailed “missing you at preschool” cards and stickers to children when they started staying home.May is Child Care Month in B.C., honouring the work of thousands of child care professionals throughout the province.When parents texted her photos of their children holding the cards and sharing their own “I miss you Ms. Heather” messages, Briese knew she had to find more ways to continue connecting with the children.“I first started with recording myself reading stories and shared the videos on Facebook and YouTube for the children to listen to. I wanted to be able to talk to them though, and have them talk to their friends too, so I set up video calls with all the children and their families, which we do twice a week now.”Briese said these video calls helped bring a routine that children were used to at school to their homes, which helped them feel more comfortable and less anxious during an uncertain time.“Every morning at preschool, we had a group meeting, like circle time, where we talked about if we were having a thumbs-up day or thumbs-down day. If a child was having a thumbs-down day, the other children come up with ideas for how they can make it better. They like being helpers and this encourages them to be there for each other. We have this group meeting on all our video calls now, followed by singing songs, discussing the weather and having show and tell once a week.”As they continued to practise safe distancing, Briese decided to reach out to parents to set up a time to surprise each child at their home and provide them with activity packages.“I would ring the doorbell then walk back to my car to keep distancing in place. The children would always be so excited to see me, and I was just as excited to see them. I visited in the evening so they could share what they have been up to, and then we would celebrate essential workers at 7 p.m. together.“I’ve dropped off a couple of activity packages so far, including a special one for Mother’s Day that had a separate sealed package for fathers to do with their children and then gift to mothers. I had to warn the fathers in advance about that package so they could hide it. I’ve tried to include lots of different activities to help parents keep their children busy throughout the day.”As children and families begin to find a new normal, Briese said she hopes to bring the tradition of graduation to them in a new way with a graduation themed activity package. The materials included will allow children to create their own graduation cap, which they can wear to their virtual graduation ceremony attended by parents and grandparents online.“At the end of the day, I want to do what is best for children and families.”For Briese and many other child care professionals, this includes making sure the children they care\\xa0for know how important and special they are.Learn More:Childcare BC is committed to keeping parents, child care providers and partners informed about steps government is taking to address the COVID-19 outbreak: http://gov.bc.ca/ChildCareCovid-19ResponseEveryday Anxiety Strategies for Educators (EASE) at Home provides resources and activities for parents and caregivers to do with children to help build routine and help them understand and manage anxiety in simple and fun ways: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/managing-your-health/mental-health-substance-use/child-teen-mental-health/easeFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

On board were 376 Sikh, Muslim and Hindu people, hoping to build a better life for themselves and their families. Instead, they were blocked from completing their journey because of discriminatory laws that banned South Asians from immigrating to Canada.“When I look out the window from my Vancouver office, I can see the exact spot where the Komagata Maru was moored for two months as its passengers endured cruel conditions.

I wonder how they would have enriched our country if given the opportunity. Some were students and labourers, others were ex-soldiers from the British Indian regiments. All of them shared the dream of making British Columbia their home.“Racism is part of our history in British Columbia, and our work continues to right the wrongs of the past. The Province of British Columbia formally apologized in the legislative chamber in 2008 for its role in the Komagata Maru tragedy. This event stands as a reminder for how racism, discrimination and hate have hurt generations of people. But it also reminds us of the incredible resiliency in our province – including all those who stand up against injustice and work to make B.C. a place where everyone is welcome and safe.“As we live through the COVID-19 pandemic, racism has tarnished our community’s response. People have been attacked and assaulted. Racism has no place in our province. We must stand firm against hate and learn from our past as we build a better, more inclusive future.”For a French translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.23_STM_Komagata_Maru-FR.pdfFor a Hindi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.23_STM_Komagata_Maru-Hindi.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.23_STM_Komagata_Maru-Punjabi.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 888 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,236 in the Fraser Health region, 127 in the Island Health region, 194 in the Interior Health region and 62 in the Northern Health region.“The discrepancy between new cases and total cases with the Interior Health and Island Health regions reported today are a data consolidation to reflect COVID-19 cases based on where individuals reside, even if they were not in the health authority during their illness.“Nine of the cases in Interior Health and one case in Island Health are individuals associated with the Kearl Lake outbreak, who completed their self-isolation in Alberta and have since recovered.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 155 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to the family, friends and caregivers of these individuals, as well as to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care outbreaks, and the outbreak at Lions Gate Hospital has been declared over. In total, 14 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and two acute-care units have active outbreaks.“Public health teams continue to provide support for community outbreaks at the Mountain Institution and Mission Institution –\\xa0both federal corrections facilities, at the Oppenheimer Group, facilities in the poultry sector and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“We are finding our new balance\\xa0between protecting our health and reopening many of the businesses and activities that are important to all of us.“Phase 2 of our BC\\'s Restart Plan is about pausing before moving forward; being thoughtful and cautious to keep everyone safe, while COVID-19 remains in our communities.“While\\xa0Phase 2 is now underway, the provincial health officer order restricting mass gatherings to no more than 50 individuals remains in place. Further, the order has been amended to also include no more than 50 vehicles for outdoor drive-in events, with a restriction on the sale of refreshments. Anyone attending these events must stay in their cars unless they have to go to washrooms, which must be serviced with running water for proper hand hygiene.“This week, we have seen British Columbians throughout the province using the WorkSafeBC public health guidelines and the rules for safe social interactions to increase their activities while protecting employees, customers, friends and family.“This approach – moving slowly, with patience and care – is our way forward. We have made great strides to flatten our curve, and we must continue with our efforts.

One of her most important accomplishments has been advocating for Indigenous rights recognition to be more firmly entrenched into the treaty negotiation process. Her tenure has also overseen the advancement of several First Nations to Stage 5 treaty negotiations, including the historic signing of both the Ditidaht and Pacheedaht First Nations’ Agreements in Principle in June 2019.The BC Treaty Commission is an independent, impartial body responsible for facilitating treaty negotiations between the provincial and federal governments and First Nations in British Columbia. Its primary role is to oversee the negotiation process to ensure parties are making effective progress in negotiations.Haldane is a practising lawyer and holds a master of laws degree in constitutional law from Osgoode Hall Law School at York University. Haldane is a member of the Sparrow family from Musqueam and is Tsimshian through Metlakatla.Quotes:Celeste Haldane, Chief Commissioner, BC Treaty Commission – “I am honoured to be reappointed by Canada, British Columbia and the First Nations Summit and to continue serving as Chief Commissioner. Although these are challenging times, negotiations of treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements must be a priority. Investing in reconciliation and Indigenous self-governance empowers healthy and prosperous regions throughout British Columbia. There have been significant milestones in negotiations, including the new rights recognition policy, and the Treaty Commission looks forward to supporting this momentum. I also want to recognize the hard work of all the parties to pivot during these times and maintain progress towards reconciliation.”Carolyn Bennett, federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations – “Over the last three years, Celeste Haldane has helped facilitate treaty negotiations in a fair and neutral manner. We are pleased that she will continue to lead the BC Treaty Commission in this important work in British Columbia. We look forward to continuing to work together with the commission and our partners, the Province of British Columbia and the First Nations Summit, to advance reconciliation and support treaty negotiations in B.C. for the benefit of those who live in Canada.”Scott Fraser, B.C.'s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation –“The BC Treaty Commission serves a vital role in this province, particularly as an independent, impartial party to the treaty process. On behalf of the Province of British Columbia, I congratulate Celeste Haldane on her reappointment as Chief Commissioner and look forward to continuing our shared journey on the path to reconciliation.”Cheryl Casimer, First Nations Summit Task Group –“Canada, British Columbia and the First Nations Summit passed the Recognition and Reconciliation of Rights Policy for Treaty Negotiations in British Columbia in the fall of 2019.\\xa0This new policy is founded on the recognition of Indigenous title and rights and provides for co-development of mandates. We are confident that Chief Commissioner Haldane’s extensive background in, and knowledge of, the B.C. treaty process will help guide us through uncharted waters as Canada, British Columbia and the First Nations Summit work towards implementing this transformative new policy.”Robert Phillips, First Nations Summit Task Group –“The First Nations Summit congratulates Celeste Haldane on her reappointment as Chief Commissioner of the BC Treaty Commission. We look forward to working with Chief Commissioner Haldane and have every confidence in her ability to work together with other Commissioners to ensure fair and equitable treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements are negotiated in British Columbia.”Lydia Hwitsum, First Nations Summit Task Group –“The experience and continuity that Chief Commissioner Haldane brings to the role of Chief Commissioner will assist Canada, British Columbia and First Nations in continuing to advance treaty negotiations in the face of technological and other challenges resulting from the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures.”\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nTo help save more lives and ensure people who use drugs alone have access to the supports they need, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA), in partnership with regional health authorities and Lifeguard Digital Health, is launching a new made-in-B.C. resource called the Lifeguard App.The App is another tool in the province’s tool box to ensure a comprehensive response to the overdose crisis in British Columbia.“The launch of this new resource couldn’t have come at a better time,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “As we face down two public health emergencies – the overdose crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic – we must ensure that people who use drugs have the resources they need, when and where they need them. Knowing that the majority of people who use drugs use alone in shelters, hotels, or at home, in addition to the challenges of physical distancing, the Lifeguard App is a\\xa0new and innovative approach that can directly link people to emergency responders if an overdose does occur.”\\xa0The App is activated by the user before they take their dose. After 50 seconds the App will sound an alarm. If the user doesn’t hit a button to stop the alarm, indicating they are fine, the alarm grows louder. After 75 seconds a text-to-voice call will go straight to 9-1-1, alerting emergency medical dispatchers of a potential overdose.The Lifeguard App is now being added to the list of essential health and social sector interventions as part of the Overdose Emergency Response Centre’s comprehensive response to the sustained and widespread overdose activity in BC. The App will be launched in regional health authorities in a phased approach between now and early June.“This is a tool that specifically supports those who are most at risk of overdose death – people who use alone” said Susan Wannamaker, PHSA’s Executive Vice President of Clinical Service Delivery. “PHSA is working hard with all our harm reduction experts and partners in government and regional health authorities to identify and implement innovative solutions to reduce the heartbreaking loss of life caused by this ongoing crisis.”PHSA, BC Emergency Health Services, Vancouver Coastal Health, the Overdose Emergency Response Centre and other regional health authorities have been working closely with Lifeguard Health during the past two years to test and pilot the App in controlled environments.“We have been working on this life-saving application for over two years to ensure it will effectively help to reduce some of the harm caused by the overdose crisis by enabling drug users to be active participants,” said Jeff Hardy, CEO and founder of Lifeguard Digital Health.“BC Ambulance paramedics and their firefighter first responder partners are often first on the scene when people overdose alone, and they see the devastating impact, so that’s why we said an enthusiastic yes to testing out this App during the past two years,” said BCEHS’ project lead Neil Lilley.People who use drugs are encouraged to use with a friend and to use overdose prevention services and supervised consumption sites where they are available.\\xa0The Lifeguard App is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared B.C. government priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.The Lifeguard App can be downloaded at both the App Store (apps.apple.com)  and Google Play. (play.google.com) The Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) plans, manages and evaluates selected specialty and province-wide health care services across BC, working with the five geographic health authorities to deliver province-wide solutions that improve the health of British Columbians.

Replacing the four-way stop with a new roundabout will help keep traffic moving more efficiently and will cut down on delays.“BC’s Restart Plan is the first in a series of steps that we will take together to protect people and ensure that our province can come back from COVID-19 stronger than before,” said Claire Trevena, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “This includes good construction-based jobs for people and investing in key projects that will help stimulate economic recovery for British Columbia. We are moving forward with several important highway projects this summer, including this roundabout for Radium, which will improve safety and prevent delays during the usually busy summer months.”Work is expected to get underway in June, and the project is slated for completion by the end of 2020. A contract for the construction has been awarded to Copcan Civil Ltd. of Nanaimo. During construction, every effort will be made to minimize disruption and impacts to local traffic, and updates will be provided via DriveBC.Businesses will remain pedestrian and vehicle accessible throughout project construction, either through existing or temporary access ways.B.C.’s provincial health officer has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres apart from each other, both in the course of their duties as well as during breaks. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.This project is cost shared. The federal contribution of up to $4.8 million is part of a $17.9-million suite of projects under the New Building Canada Fund’s Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component-National and Regional Projects.

Our government has been working with industry on ways to support the more than 180,000 British Columbians who work in pubs, restaurants and other parts of the sector,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Speeding up the process will help restaurants, pubs, breweries and other licensees, and give British Columbians more options for safely eating out this summer, while continuing to follow Dr. Henry’s directions.”To support businesses in their reopening efforts, the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation branch (LCRB) will now permit food-primary, liquor-primary and manufacturer licensees, such as wineries, breweries and distilleries, to apply through a simplified online process to temporarily expand their service areas until Oct. 31, 2020.The temporary authorizations are focused on expanding a licensed service area’s footprint only and will not permit an increase in an establishment’s overall occupancy. Licensees must comply with all local bylaws and liquor-primary and manufacturer licensees must also receive the approval of their local government.There are no fees associated with the temporary expansion applications, which will be reviewed in the order they are received using an expedited approval process for faster processing times. While there will not be a site inspection prior to approval of the permit, inspectors will conduct regular compliance inspections.“This is excellent news that will be welcomed by all of our members and by businesses throughout B.C.,” said Ian Tostenson, president and CEO, B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association. “This pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for all of us, and it has been invaluable for government and industry to work together as they have, as we take these important steps toward recovery.

The building will also include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical room.Peterson Place is part of a commitment between the Province and the City of Surrey to deliver 250 permanent supportive modular homes to replace the current temporary sites in the community. Peterson Place is the first project under construction as part of this commitment.“With construction beginning today on Peterson Place, we are on our way to providing permanent, safe and meaningful housing to our most vulnerable residents,” said Doug McCallum, mayor of Surrey. “This project illustrates the dedication of various levels of government and organizations working together to end the cycle of homelessness.\\xa0I want to thank everyone involved for bringing this project from idea to reality.”\\xa0\\xa0Fraserside Community Services Society (FCSS) will operate the new housing with supports. It will provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work.\"We are thrilled that even during these uncertain pandemic times, this project is moving ahead,” said Lynda Edmonds, CEO of FCSS. “We are thankful that the Province and the City of Surrey recognize the importance of safe and secure housing for people experiencing homelessness. The addition of 38 new units and the expansion of on-site services, including access to daily meals and counselling, will have a significant and positive impact on the lives of residents at Peterson Place and in creating broader communities of belonging for all people in Surrey.\"Construction is expected to be complete by the end of summer 2020, with residents moving in during the fall.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nThe Province will provide $11.3 million to the project as part of the Homelessness Action Plan, as well as a startup budget of $100,000 and an annual ongoing operating subsidy of $732,000.\\nIn addition to these homes, the Province has worked with partners to open 161 supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness in Surrey over the last two years.

       "  '\\n\\nResurfacing work will get underway on Sunday, May 31, 2020,\\xa0on Highway 1 between the Willingdon Avenue interchange and the Gaglardi Way interchange, making this route a safer and smoother ride for all motorists.The $7.4-million project includes resurfacing Highway 1 in both directions, including the shoulders and the on- and off-ramps of the connecting interchanges. The paving work is expected to finish this summer. The work is weather dependent, therefore the dates are subject to change.To minimize delays for drivers, work will be done during the night hours with a minimum of two lanes open to traffic through the work zone. While work is underway, the speed limit will be reduced to 70 km/h through the project site. However, during non-working hours, the highway, including ramps and interchanges, will function at normal operating speeds with all lanes open.A contract for the work has been awarded to All Roads Construction Ltd. The ministry is working closely with the contractor and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.B.C.’s provincial health officer has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres apart from each other in the course of their duties, as well as during breaks.Drivers are advised to watch for nightly lane closures and obey all traffic control personnel, construction speed limits and signs.

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.\"Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 887 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,223 in the Fraser Health region, 126 in the Island Health region, 183 in the Interior Health region and 60 in the Northern Health region.\"We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths, one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and two in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 152 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to the family, friends and caregivers of these individuals, as well as to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"There have been no new health-care outbreaks, and the outbreak at the Windermere Care Centre has now been declared over. In total, 14 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks.“The Mountain Institution, a federal corrections facility, has one confirmed case of COVID-19 in an inmate who had recently transferred from the Matsqui Institution. Fraser Health public health teams are investigating and assisting at\\xa0both facilities.“The outbreak at United Poultry has been declared over. Public health teams continue to provide support at the remaining community outbreaks, including at the Oppenheimer Group, those in the poultry sector, at the Mission Institution and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“Our priority is the health and safety of British Columbians. Our personal circumstances are unique, but the actions we can take to protect each other and ourselves are the same.“As we progress safely into Phase 2 of\\xa0BC\\'s Restart Plan, we can all learn from the many people who have been working so hard to provide essential services, while keeping themselves and their households safe.“One example is the use of non-medical masks or cloth face coverings. As we have seen on public transit or in a barbershop,\\xa0a non-medical mask keeps our droplets in and provides an extra layer of protection for people around us when it is difficult to keep a safe physical distance or when services require people to be in close contact for periods of time.“We must also continue to move slowly and with caution, and this is the approach that is being taken as child care centres reopen and schools resume some in-class learning.“Schools have strict protocols for enhanced infection prevention and workplace health and safety. Safe physical distancing measures will be in place, and anyone who is ill will not be allowed into any school.“Like all illnesses that can be transmitted through close contact,\\xa0school communities are notified as part of active public health contact tracing when someone in the school community has a confirmed case. Any close contacts who are susceptible are also required to stay home and self-isolate.“If you are unsure or have questions, contact your family physician or 811 to help determine the best steps for you and your family.“The provincewide survey, Your story, our future, is an opportunity to share your personal experience with COVID-19 so far.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Government of B.C. is inviting non-profit and Indigenous housing societies, First Nations, housing co-operatives and municipalities to propose new affordable housing projects for the second intake of the Building BC: Community Housing Fund.Announced in 2018 as part of the Province’s 10-year, $7-billion housing plan, the Community Housing Fund is an investment of $1.9 billion to build more than 14,000 mixed-income rental homes for middle- and low-income families and individuals. In less than two years, more than 5,200 homes have been completed, are under construction or in development through this program in more than 40 communities.The Province, through BC Housing, is opening the next request for proposals (RFP) for the Community Housing Fund. This RFP is the next step forward in the Province‘s 10-year plan and will fund approximately 3,000 new affordable homes.“During these extraordinary times, it is clearer than ever that safe, secure and affordable housing is critical for all British Columbians,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These new projects will deliver urgently needed rental homes for people, while also creating good jobs and supporting B.C.’s economic recovery.”The Community Housing Fund supports mixed-income buildings where 20% of the units are for households with very low incomes (including those on income assistance), 50% of the units are for households with incomes up to $64,000 and 30% of the units are for households with incomes up to approximately $74,000.Organizations are invited to submit project proposals to BC Housing beginning on May 27, 2020. The RFP will remain open until mid-January 2021. However, organizations are encouraged to apply early as an initial round of projects will be approved in fall 2020.Funding is available to groups that applied for the first round of funding though the Community Housing Fund and to those who have applied for other Building BC funds. All Building BC funding programs are open to First Nations.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Jill Atkey, CEO, BC Non-Profit Housing Association –“We applaud the Government of B.C. for prioritizing affordable housing in the midst of a global pandemic that has demonstrated just how critical housing is to our individual and collective health. These investments matter more than ever, and the community housing sector is ready and willing to partner on delivering these affordable homes in communities right across the province.”Thom Armstrong, CEO, Co-operative Housing Federation of B.C. –“This is very welcome news, and not a moment too soon. There is no better tonic for an economy in recovery mode than good jobs and affordable homes. This announcement promises both, and the community housing sector will be pleased to partner with the Province in delivering thousands of affordable homes for people who need them most.”Margaret Pfoh, CEO, Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) –“AHMA is confident in the innovation, determination and creativity that our members will submit in their RFPs for the Community Housing Fund. Our members make up one-third of all Indigenous housing providers in Canada, and together we look forward to continuing our work with the Province to create culturally appropriate and affordable housing so that every Indigenous person in B.C. can have a place to call home.”Learn More:Information about the Building BC: Community Housing Fund can be found here: http://www.bchousing.org/CHFA map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The bridge is designed to make travel safer and more efficient for people who live and work in the region, especially during freshet season.“The 2016 floods caused a lot of hardship for people in the Peace District, and we want to make sure our infrastructure can withstand future flooding,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “I am proud of the work we have done throughout the province to safeguard our communities.”\\xa0The contractor, Brocor Construction Ltd., will begin by relocating municipal water and sewer lines to a location below the creek. Bridge construction will begin after the utilities are complete and functioning.Once built, the new 45-metre-long bridge will maintain the existing road configuration, with five lanes for traffic and sidewalks on both sides of the road for pedestrians. The project, budgeted for $28 million, is expected to be complete in 2023.“We are extremely excited to see the construction of the 8th Street bridge begin this year,” said Dale Bumstead, mayor of Dawson Creek. “The project has been an important piece of the infrastructure improvement for our community and region to assist in the overall flood mitigation work the City of Dawson Creek has been focused on for our city. The importance of the 8th Street bridge project cannot be overstated, and we appreciate the support of the Province of B.C. in completing this important project.”During construction, two lanes will remain open on the existing structure to allow traffic to flow along Highway 2. Drivers are advised to follow instructions of traffic control personnel and obey the construction zone speed limit.The ministry is working closely with the contractor and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.The B.C. provincial health officer has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms, such as sore throat, fever, sneezing or coughing, will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.Learn More:For travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMRO\\xa0For guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNTFor the most up-to-date highway travel information, visit: www.DriveBC.ca\\nOr follow @DriveBC on Twitter.A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe Government of B.C., the City of Kelowna and Canadian Mental Health Association Kelowna are working in partnership to build close to 40 new urgently needed supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness in Kelowna.“The need for safe and secure housing has never been clearer, and these new homes will give more people a place to call their own,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are working quickly and urgently with our partners to protect all British Columbians during the COVID-19 crisis, including our province’s most vulnerable – because when people have housing, it’s good for everyone in the community.”Located at 1055 and 1063 Ellis St., the three-storey modular apartment building will include 38 self-contained studio units with private washrooms, showers and kitchens. The building will also include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical room.To help people move from the streets and shelters into this safe and secure housing, the city and the Province are working together to expedite the building process and removing the requirement of municipal rezoning. The current lease is for 10 years, and the property will go through the municipal rezoning process if the lease is extended beyond that.“Homelessness is an evolving, dynamic crisis in our community, and these kinds of partnerships go a long way towards creating solutions,” said Colin Basran, mayor, City of Kelowna. “This is a strategic land investment that will not only create much needed solutions in the short term, but also has long-term potential with a future land use designation for multi-storey residential housing. In addition to being close to downtown, this property is ideally located adjacent to existing municipal park space and could fulfil many different civic objectives after expiry of the lease.”BC Housing supports the city in its commitment to the Journey Home Strategy, focusing on ending chronic and episodic homelessness, introducing measures to prevent homelessness in the first place\\xa0and implementing a co-ordinated systems approach to homelessness.“To provide people with the support and services they need to begin their recovery journey, they first need a place to call home,” said Stephanie Ball, executive director, Central Okanagan Journey Home Society. “This is a welcome addition to the over 100 units of housing with supports already planned to come on stream over the next two years as we work to meet the goals of Kelowna’s five-year plan to address homelessness.”The Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) Kelowna will operate the new housing. It will provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work.“Access to safe and stable housing is a crucial first step needed for anyone who experiences homelessness so they can begin to get their feet back under them,” says Shelagh Turner, executive director, CMHA Kelowna. “We are proud to be the operators of this building and our other supportive housing in Kelowna so we can be there to help end the cycle of homelessness.”Site preparation work will start in June, with construction expected to be complete in fall 2020.Quick Facts:\\nThe Province will provide $9.5 million to the project through the Supportive Housing Fund, as well as an annual operating subsidy of $1.3 million.\\nIn addition to these homes, the Province has worked with partners to open 136 supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness in Kelowna over the last two years. This includes 50 homes at Samuel Place, 40 at Heath House and 46 at Hearthstone. An additional 138 supportive homes are currently underway.\\nMore than 2,700 spaces in hotels, motels and community centres across B.C. have been secured to help vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

       "  '\\n\\nShane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, has issued the following statement regarding tent encampments in Victoria at Topaz Park and Pandora Avenue:“Since April 25, 2020, 308 people experiencing homelessness in Victoria’s Topaz Park and Pandora corridor have been moved into safe temporary housing. The housing provided includes wraparound services such as daily meals, support with mental health and addictions challenges, and help with finding more permanent housing solutions.“All 360 people who were camped at Topaz Park and along Pandora Avenue as of April 25 have been offered indoor accommodation. People continue to actively move into temporary accommodation today, and we will co-ordinate with the City of Victoria as we move people out and close the sites over the coming days.“I want to thank the dozens of people who have been involved in this partnership, including staff from BC Housing, the City of Victoria, Island Health, the Province, service providers, peer support workers and outreach workers. All have approached this massive effort to house people with compassion and care, providing people with choices that best suit their individual needs.“These actions were taken to protect the health and safety of people living in the encampments as well as the front-line workers supporting them. Moving people from these encampments to temporary safe and secure housing is a major step in the Province’s effort to support our most vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.“We also continue to work with the additional people who have since moved into the area to provide them with shelter and housing options. Outside of the encampments, there are still many people in Victoria who need housing and support services. Outreach workers continue to register people on the housing registry. A resource guide has also been developed so people have information on safe places to shelter, access hygiene, harm reduction, health care and food services.“In Victoria, as in communities around the province, our work is not done. Throughout B.C., we have more than 23,000 homes already underway or complete as part of our 10-year housing plan, and there are more to come. As part of that, we are working towards creating longer term and permanent housing solutions with ongoing supports so that after the pandemic, people do not return to homelessness but instead are able to build a better and more comfortable life. This work will continue in the months and years ahead.”\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

It can escalate to punching walls, throwing objects, threatening children, physical violence and death.From volunteering at a women’s transition house, to my role as a child protection worker, as a national manager at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and then an executive director in British Columbia, I have always served families, women and others impacted by abuse.Having worked in the social sector for over 30 years, I have heard too many stories from women about the horrors that can happen at home. Every story is different, but everyone in these situations needs to know help is available.\\xa0Every person facing domestic violence needs to know it is not their fault.Abusers often use threats and violence, while others use money, as\\xa0their means of control.A young mom I knew through my work was in an abusive relationship. He did massive damage to her home before she was able to get him out. Repairs cost her a fortune. What was even more difficult to repair was the psychological impact of his violence.I know another woman who was never allowed by her husband to have her own bank account. As part of her safety plan, she began to secretly save money so she could leave. Her abuser found this out and took her cash so he could maintain his control.I recently met a woman whose partner put a gun up to her head in front of their children. She survived that night. Some do not.Hundreds of women are admitted to B.C. hospitals each year with severe injuries caused by their partners. In an average year, 12 lives are tragically lost to domestic violence.As government, it’s our job to make sure that when people ask for help in leaving violence, we provide a safe place for them to go. In 2018, we made the first significant investment in transition housing in over two decades.Through the Women’s Transition Housing Fund, the Province is investing in creating 1,500 new transition house beds, safe homes and second-stage homes so that there are places for women and children to sleep safely at night. Unfortunately, we are playing catch-up because of years of unmet needs.The COVID-19 virus has forced us to stay home and keep our distance from friends and family, creating a perfect storm for the escalation of abuse. More than ever, people facing violence or abuse – many with children – need our help to find a safe place to stay.If you are in immediate danger, please call 911 immediately.If you or someone you know is being abused, or if you are concerned about someone’s safety, contact VictimLink BC through its toll-free 24/7 confidential, multilingual telephone service at 1 800 563-0808\\nOr by email: VictimLinkBC@bc211.caVictimLink BC’s trained victim service workers can provide immediate crisis support for victims of family or sexual violence. They can also connect you to safe housing, provide information and referral services for all victims of crime.Domestic and sexual abuse is not a private matter to be kept behind closed doors. Violence against women should never be tolerated – not during this pandemic, not ever.As government, we will be there for people who need our help and a safe place to go, day or night.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

On Dec. 3, 150 people attended an open house in Sooke\\xa0to look at proposed designs and provide feedback. The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure also received 200 submissions online, by email and letter.Public input has led to the following updates to the design of the Connie Road to Glinz Lake Road portion of the project:\\nA new pedestrian underpass will be added to Highway 14 just east of Glinz Lake Road/Polymede Place to support active transportation in the region.\\nNew eastbound and westbound bus bays will be added to Highway 14 at Glinz Lake Road/Polymede Place to better serve transit users.\\nThe proposed Cooper’s Cove U-turn has been removed. Instead, a connector road between Manzer Road and Gillespie Road will allow Manzer Road residents access and egress from the highway via the new Gillespie Road grade-separated intersection.\\nThis connector will provide an alternative emergency detour connection for Highway 14 between Glinz Lake Road and Gillespie Road.\\xa0\\n\\nCulvert sizes will be increased to accommodate crossings of amphibians and mammals.\\nMedian barriers with road-level holes will be strategically placed to help keep small mammals from being trapped on the highway.\\nApproximately 30 streetlights will be added near side-road intersections to improve visibility for drivers.\\xa0\\nUpdated project designs and the Consultation Summary Report are available on the project web page: www.gov.bc.ca/highway14The Highway 14 Improvement Project includes:\\nwidening and realigning\\xa0approximately 1.5 kilometres of road between Glinz Lake Road and Connie Road;\\na new \"park and ride\" lot on Gillespie Road; and\\npavement resurfacing and shoulder widening along over 10 kilometres between Otter Point Road and Woodhaven Road.\\xa0\\nThe portion of the project from Otter Point Road to Woodhaven Road will be tendered this spring. Following completion of the final design, the Highway 14 realignment will go to tender this summer.These corridor improvements total $85.7 million, with the Government of Canada contributing up to $30,233,000 through the New Building Canada Fund and the Government of British Columbia providing up to $55,482,000.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

This includes workers delivering a range of health and social services to people most vulnerable to COVID-19.More than 250,000 eligible front-line workers will receive temporary\\xa0pandemic pay, a lump-sum payment of about $4 per hour for a 16-week period, starting on March 15, 2020. Eligible workers will receive the payment directly through their employer and do not need to apply.“People at the front lines of the pandemic are working tirelessly to keep us and our loved ones healthy, while also delivering services to the most vulnerable in our community,” James said. “This cost-shared program with the federal government will\\xa0benefit thousands of British Columbia’s front-line health and social service workers.”Temporary pandemic pay is part of government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide relief to people, communities and businesses in British Columbia. It builds off the planned minimum wage increase set for June 1, 2020, and existing supports for people during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the B.C.

We’re here to support you.“The WorksafeBC prevention information hotline (1 888 621-7233) is your first stop. Each health authority also has environmental health officers who can guide you along the way.“We understand the importance of getting our B.C. businesses open once again, and an incredible\\xa0amount of effort has been put into finding the best path forward.“As we cautiously progress through our Restart plan, know that we are in this together. Step by step, let’s continue to do this safely, with kindness and compassion.”Learn More:For the Your Story, Our Future survey, visit: www.bccdc.ca/covid19survey\\nFor those who cannot complete the survey online, or need assistance in another language, call 1 833 707-1900 to take the survey over the phone.

       "  \"\\n\\nB.C. child care professionals are finding creative ways to stay connected and support the children and families in their community during the COVID-19 pandemic.It's a good example of why May is Child Care Month in B.C., honouring the work of thousands of child care professionals throughout the province.When Coast Mountain Children’s Society in Terrace decided to stay open to care for the children of essential service workers, staff knew they also needed to find ways to care for the children at their centre who would be staying home with their parents during the pandemic.“That’s how our busy bags began,” says Cindy Hall, manager and early childhood educator. Busy bags is a unique program where parents from across the community drop by to pick up free activity bags that are pinned to the fence each weekday.“What started off as a project to help our children feel happy at home and connected to their friends and teachers has morphed into something pretty awesome,” says Hall.With over 60 busy bags created every week, Hall and her small team of busy bees change\\xa0the contents by combining simple ideas with supplies from a well-stocked art room, so children always have something new to make.“So far, our bags have included beading activities; make-your-own book projects; create-your-own whiteboard with reusable activity sheets; colour-matching games made with popsicle sticks; and some birdseed and a pinecone to make bird feeders. We even made over 8,000 batches of playdough to go along with playdough tools. And we always include a little note to let children know we are thinking of them,” says Hall.For Easter, the educators delivered over 200 special activity bags directly to the children who attend the centre. It gave them a chance to see the children in person, at a safe distance. “This is so fulfilling for us. We’re missing the kids just as much as they miss us and their friends,” says Hall.The response from the community has been overwhelming. “This is a challenging time for everyone,” says Hall. “Parents have told us how stressed they’ve been with children who are bored and longing for their buddies. These busy bags have provided kids with hours of entertainment and joy knowing that we’re thinking of them. We’ve received a ton of positive feedback, with dozens of messages of appreciation and photos. It’s wonderful to see our students and how they are using their creativity with the supplies provided to them.”It’s not just the centre’s child care professionals who are working to spread happiness and share community spirit. Inspired by their teachers, children from the centre are tapping into their own creativity to help brighten the days of those in a nearby seniors’ home. They’ve been busy decorating paper hearts and adding jokes, something they came up with by themselves, to provide a bit of laughter at a time of uncertainty.The centre is now thinking of other ways to keep children connected. Hall says, “We’ve had parents call and ask, ‘What song is that my kid is singing?’ and, ‘How do we do this certain activity?’\\xa0We’re looking at new opportunities for children to virtually connect and set up livestreaming activities like circle time and science experiments.”\\xa0Learn More:In response to COVID-19, government has developed a child care referral system to help parents in essential service roles find licensed child care nearby.

       "  \"\\n\\nThe Government of B.C., the City of Prince Rupert and North Coast Transition Society (NCTS) have partnered to purchase a building that will provide new, permanent, supportive housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness.\\xa0“Homelessness affects not only those experiencing it, but also\\xa0the community as a whole,” said Jennifer Rice, MLA for North Coast. “We’re excited to work with our partners to convert this building into new supportive homes for people in Prince Rupert. These homes with supports will help people experiencing homelessness to regroup and recover, and the benefits will extend into the community.”The Province, through BC Housing, has purchased the former Raffles Inn motel at 1080\\xa03rd Ave. and will convert it into a permanent supportive housing building with up to 48 units, each with private washrooms, showers and mini kitchens. The building will include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical examination room.Once complete, this building will have the capacity for a 35-space temporary shelter or an extreme weather response\\xa0shelter.“These new units of supportive housing will offer 24/7 support to our community's most vulnerable, including achieving economies of scale by integrating a temporary shelter as well,” said Lee Brain, mayor, Prince Rupert. “When the first supportive units opened at Crow’s Nest, they were immediately full, proving that the need exceeded the supply of available units. We are happy to be working with the Province to make this happen in Prince Rupert.”NCTS will operate the supportive housing building and will provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work.“We are very excited about this opportunity and much needed project that serve the needs of the most marginalized members of our community,” said Christine White, executive director, NCTS. “The people of Prince Rupert have been so generous and supportive of those living on the streets. We know that this will benefit the community as having a home and a safe place is a start for life-changing opportunities. BC Housing and MLA Jennifer Rice have been a huge support in\\xa0this project, in addition to all our other community partners. We look forward to moving on with the project.”NCTS operates a 35-space temporary shelter at Fisherman’s Hall at 869 Fraser St. Once renovations at 1080\\xa03rd Ave. are complete, all guests from the shelter will be transitioned to the new supportive housing.\\xa0Construction will begin in fall 2020. The shelter portion of the building is expected to open in early 2021, with the supportive homes ready by fall 2021.Quick Facts:\\nThe Province will provide $11.8 million to the project through the Supportive Housing Fund, as well as an annual operating subsidy of $1.2 million.\\nThe Province worked with its partners to open the Crow’s Nest, a 36-unit modular supportive building for people experiencing homelessness in Prince Rupert in March 2019.\\nIn response to COVID-19, more than 2,400 spaces in hotels, motels and community centres throughout B.C. have been secured for vulnerable people to reside. In Prince Rupert, BC Housing has identified one site with 35 spaces as temporary accommodation for vulnerable people in the community.\\nLearn More:For more information on how BC Housing is supporting British Columbians during the COVID-19 outbreak, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19/A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is\\xa0 available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/Two backgrounders follow.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, has issued the following statement about travel during the May long weekend.“The May long weekend is the unofficial start of summer that we look forward to throughout the year. It’s often the start of road trips, camping and spending more time outside with our friends and families.“This long weekend is different. A global pandemic puts us all at risk – and we all must stay in our local communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside.“The good news is because of your efforts and sacrifice so far, you can now start to expand your circle slowly, but keep your group small, always keeping in mind ‘fewer faces and bigger spaces.’ Outside is ideal.“You can have a backyard barbecue with another family, or a few close friends spread throughout the yard. Just remember not to share drinks or reach into the same chip bowl. Instead, prepare individual servings. You can also go for long walks and to local parks.“Spending a long weekend away from people we care about is difficult, but what we are doing matters to ensure more travel and freedom later. We will be able to enjoy fun spring and summer recreational activities again together, and they will come sooner if we just stay the course. Together, we are helping slow the spread of COVID-19.“Let\\xa0me be clear. Staying in your local community this long weekend means no leisure road trips to cabins or to go boating – especially across our borders. Instead,\\xa0I encourage everyone to reach out safely to local friends or families in your neighbourhood and to connect virtually with close ones living in other communities.“Please, continue to make every effort to protect loved ones, our Elders and our health-care workers.“Now, more than ever, we need to stay 100% all in.”\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Additionally, businesses in sectors under health orders limiting service (such as restaurants, pubs, salons and personal services) will not be able to open until those orders are lifted or modified.“We all have a shared responsibility to build confidence amongst workers and customers, so everyone feels safe accessing businesses and services,” Bains said. “We know that businesses will open at their own pace, and I encourage them to proceed in a careful way ensuring safety measures are in place, effective and understood.”Outreach with all sectors continues in order to support the production of sector standards, which will provide additional guidance for businesses and help the sharing of best practices.WorkSafeBC indicated additional sector-specific guidelines will be available in the coming days for child care, health services, and recreation and sports.Learn More:Industry-specific guidance and resources are available online: https://www.worksafebc.com/en/about-us/covid-19-updates/covid-19-returning-safe-operationFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For a French translation:\\xa0WorkSafeBC publie des directives propres à certains secteurs d’activité pour la prochaine phase du redémarrage\\xa0(PDF)For a Punjabi translation:\\xa0ਮੁੜ-ਚਾਲੂ ਯੋਜਨਾ ਦੇ ਅਗਲੇ ਪੜਾਅ ਲਈ ਵਰਕਸੇਫ਼ ਬੀਸੀ ਵੱਲੋਂ ਉਦਯੋਗ-ਵਿਸ਼ੇਸ਼ ਦਿਸ਼ਾਨਿਰਦੇਸ਼ ਜਾਰੀ\\xa0(PDF)For a Chinese translation:\\xa0卑詩工作安全局發布下一階段重啟計劃的特定行業指引\\xa0(PDF)For a Farsi translation:\\xa0WorkSafeBC درک رشتنم ددجم عورش ھمانرب یدعب زاف یارب ار فانصا یامنھار\\xa0(PDF)For a Korean translation:\\xa0WorkSafeBC, 재시작의 다음 단계에 대한 산업별 지침 발표\\xa0(PDF)For a Spanish translation:\\xa0WorkSafeBC publica directrices específicas para diferentes sectores en la siguiente fase de reactivación\\xa0(PDF)For a Tagalog translation: Inilabas ng WorkSafeBC ang espesipiko-saindustriyang patnubay para sa susunod na yugto ng muling pagsisimula\\xa0(PDF)\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nParents will have the choice of bringing their children back to class on a part-time basis this school year as part of BC’s Restart Plan, with the goal of returning to full-time classes in September 2020, provided it is safe to do so.“British Columbians have worked hard to flatten our curve. As we move into the next phase of our pandemic plan after the May long weekend, the science shows us that we’re ready to bring students back to school safely on a gradual and part-time basis,” said Premier John Horgan. “This will be welcome news for many families who have struggled to adjust to remote and online learning, and for parents who are going back to work. At every step, we will move slowly and make health and safety our top priority. B.C. has done well under the guidance of our provincial health officials, and now is the time to take this next step together.”To make sure schools are safe for students and staff, the number of students in school each day will be reduced, with most receiving in-class instruction part time. School districts will determine scheduling for classes and transportation arrangements. For kindergarten to Grade 5, this means most students will go to school half time (such as alternating days), while grades 6 to 12 will go to school about one day a week. Children of essential service workers and students needing additional supports will have the option to attend school full time. Families that decide not to send their children to class may continue learning from home.“School is the place where kids learn how to connect with others and grow together, and it’s incredibly important for students who need extra support to get more time with their teachers and support workers,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “We’ve looked at what measures other jurisdictions are putting in place and we’re taking direction from our provincial health officials, so students, educators and staff know we’re taking every precaution to protect their health and safety.”Health and safetyAll boards of education and independent school authorities will be required to implement strict provincial health officer and WorkSafeBC health and safety measures to reduce the risk COVID-19 transmission, including:\\ndesks spaced apart and avoiding groups or gatherings of students in hallways or other common areas;\\nregular cleaning of high-contact surfaces like door knobs, toilet seats, keyboards and desks at least twice a day, and cleaning the school building at least once a day;\\nstudents, educators and staff will be required to clean their hands before entering school property, and there will be more hand-sanitizing and cleaning stations available, with well-stocked supplies;\\nstaggered drop-offs, lunch and recess breaks, with increased outside time;\\nstaff and students (or their parents/guardians) must assess themselves daily for symptoms of COVID-19. If any student or staff member has even mild symptoms, arrangements will be made for that person to be returned home;\\none student per seat on school buses, unless children are from the same house. Consider using plexiglass to separate the bus driver from students; and\\nstudents or employees should not share food or personal items like phones, pens or pencils. Clear protocols also need to be in place for the safe and healthy handling of all food items.\\xa0\\nGradual approachThe\\xa0Ministry of Education has developed a five-stage approach to operate schools, depending on risk of transmission. Schools will also have plans in place for each stage, ensuring they are ready to make changes if there is a risk of transmission, a second wave or a community outbreak.Each school district and independent school must have its\\xa0return-to-class and safety plans approved by the ministry before moving to the next stage.\\xa0The plans\\xa0will be posted on each district’s website\\xa0for families to access. The ministry will support boards of education and independent school authorities in building these plans, and operations during the pandemic will be regularly monitored.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Since returning to class is voluntary and most students will be attending part time, school leaders will contact\\xa0families to make arrangements for children to return to in-class instruction. If parents have not heard from their schools by May 22, 2020, they are asked to contact their principal. Parents and caregivers are advised to follow the schedule provided for their child to ensure a safe and orderly restart.Child careMany child care centres have continued to operate safely throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to support essential service workers in communities across B.C.Updated health and safety guidelines for child care settings released by the provincial health officer will support child care centres that were closed to reopen safely as they are able, and will reassure parents as they return to work that their children will be cared for in a safe environment.Information from the BC Centre for Disease Control states the COVID-19 virus has a very low infection rate in children. As well, children are not the primary drivers of COVID-19 spread in child care facilities, schools or in community settings. Like schools, child care centres will need to take additional precautions to maintain the health and safety of their employees and the children they care\\xa0for.“We know that parents will continue to make the right child care decisions for their family, based on their individual circumstances, and providers will do the same for their centres and the child care professionals who work there,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “While we are giving the necessary tools to child care centres to operate safely, it is ultimately the choice of parents and providers.”New\\xa0provincial health officer's guidelines for safely providing child care include:\\nmaintaining the physical space requirements set out in the Child Care Licensing Regulation. Child care centres have sufficient space to support physical distancing between staff without reducing the number of children in care at any one time.\\norganizing children into smaller groups and/or spreading children out to minimize direct physical contact.\\ncleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces at least twice a day.\\xa0General cleaning of the centre should occur at least once a day with common cleaning and disinfectant products.\\nsetting up hand-hygiene stations at the entrance, so children can clean their hands when they enter. If a sink with soap and water is not available, provide hand sanitizer but keep out of children’s reach and supervise its use. Additional hand-hygiene opportunities should be built into the daily schedule.\\xa0\\nstaggering the timings of pickup and drop-off. A daily check at drop-off may be conducted by asking parents and caregivers to confirm\\xa0their child does not have symptoms of common cold, influenza, COVID-19\\xa0or other respiratory disease. There is no role for screening children or staff for specific symptoms, checking temperatures\\xa0or COVID-19 testing. Such activities are reserved for health-care professionals.\\xa0\\xa0\\nhaving children outside often, including for learning activities, snack time and play time.\\nensuring each child has their own individual meal or snack. Reusable utensils must be cleaned and sanitized after each use.\\nasking parents and caregivers to only bring personal comfort items (e.g., stuffies) if they are clean and can be laundered at the end of each day.\\nThese guidelines will be complemented by WorkSafeBC guidelines for child care providers, which will be released next week.Working togetherAs B.C. takes steps towards a recovery by removing some of the restrictions, employers are encouraged to be flexible when it comes to arrangements for parents of school-age students.The Ministry of Education is working with all 60 school districts, independent school authorities, First Nations schools, teachers, school leaders, support staff, public health officials and all its education partners to co-ordinate the next steps for accommodating more students in class.“As we look to create\\xa0our\\xa0new normal, reopening our schools\\xa0to in-class learning is an important step,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer.\\xa0“It will\\xa0look different, but will be done\\xa0in way that is\\xa0safe for everyone.\\xa0I want to assure all the\\xa0staff,\\xa0students\\xa0and families\\xa0that we will face the challenges that come with this\\xa0transition together –\\xa0and we will do it\\xa0in a\\xa0measured and thoughtful way.”Quick Facts:\\nThere are about 5,000 students already in classrooms, including children of essential service workers and those who require extra support.\\nGovernment has invested over $90 million to support more than 2,600 child care centres to remain open and more than 1,400 centres that have closed so they can reopen in the future.\\nScience and research show that children under 19 are at low risk of transmitting COVID-19 and suspending schools only has modest impacts in minimizing the spread of the virus.\\xa0\\nThe Ministry of Children and Family Development is providing temporary emergency funding to assist licensed child care centres to stay open, even with reduced enrolment, and to assist centres that temporarily close with fixed costs so they can reopen and serve families when able.\\xa0\\nTemporary emergency funding will continue to be in place and assessed on a go-forward basis, as schools and businesses reopen.\\nLearn More:For more information on health and safety standards for K-12 schools, plus accurate, timely information about schools, programs and educational services, including regularly updated frequently asked questions in multiple languages, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/SafeSchools\\xa0 \\xa0More information on health and safety standards for child care, plus the latest COVID-19 related child care information is available at: www.gov.bc.ca/ChildCareCovid-19ResponseWorkSafeBC information:\\nhttps://www.worksafebc.com/en/health-safety/create-manage/joint-health-safety-committees\\nhttps://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/posters/help-prevent-spread-covid-19-handwashing?lang=en\\nhttps://www.worksafebc.com/en/health-safety/create-manage/managing-risk/controlling-risks\\nhttps://www.worksafebc.com/en/health-safety/create-manage/rights-responsibilitiesFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19For a French translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_NR_School_Restart-FR.pdfFor an Arabic translation:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/In_class_instruction_2020_ARABIC.pdfFor a Punjabi translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_NR_School_Restart-Punjabi.pdfFor a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_NR_School_Restart-CN.pdfFor a Farsi translaiton:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_NR_School_Restart-Farsi.pdfFor a Korean translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_NR_School_Restart-Korean.pdfFor a Spanish translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_NR_School_Restart-Spanish.pdfFor a Tagalog translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_NR_School_Restart-TG.pdfFour backgrounders follow.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe\\xa0Province has purchased the Comfort Inn Hotel, located at 3020 Blanshard St., to provide more affordable homes for people in Victoria.“Everyone deserves to have safe, stable housing they can afford, and this site offers great potential to deliver a mix of permanent housing to meet the needs of people in Victoria,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “This will further add to the significant efforts underway with community and local government partners in the Capital Regional District to tackle the housing crisis and build the homes people need.”The long-term use of the site will be determined through engagement with the community. In the short term, the building will provide approximately 65\\xa0rooms of temporary accommodations with wraparound supports for people currently living in encampments on the Pandora Avenue corridor and Topaz Park.“Often people experiencing homelessness are not able to access the support and services they need,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “The purchase of the Comfort Inn, combined with medical and social supports, will help people make the transition from the street to permanent housing.”BC Housing is partnering with Our Place to operate the building, which will start to receive people – referred by Island Health and BC Housing – in the coming days.“This is a substantial investment in our community and will provide housing for those who need it most,” said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “This site has significant redevelopment potential to provide a range of affordable housing in the long term. I look forward to working with the community and with BC Housing to determine the long-term use of this site.”People will have access to services, such as meals, health-care services, addictions treatment and harm reduction, storage for personal belongings and other supports, including 24/7 staffing to provide security to residents of the building and the surrounding neighbourhood.“Our Place is looking forward to partnering with BC Housing in this bold initiative to provide indoor accommodations for our street family during this health crisis,” said Grant McKenzie, director of communications, Our Place Society. “We intend to serve this vulnerable population with dignity while striving to be a good neighbour to the community.”BC Housing will set up a new community advisory committee that will include representatives from the Hillside Quadra and Burnside Gorge community associations and the surrounding community. This committee will oversee the supportive housing’s integration within the community and will address any concerns raised by people in the neighbourhood.From April 25 to May 13, 2020, 208 people from encampments on Pandora Avenue and in Topaz Park have moved into safe, temporary accommodations with supports to protect their health and safety in the overlapping COVID-19 and overdose crises.Quick Facts:\\nThe B.C. government provided approximately $18.5 million to acquire the building.\\nThe Province is working in partnership to build approximately 3,330 new affordable homes for people with a range of incomes in the Capital Regional District:\\nHousing for people with middle incomes: 121 homes\\nHousing for people with low to moderate incomes, including families, seniors and Indigenous peoples: 1,924 homes\\nHousing for women and children leaving violence: 39 homes\\nHousing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness: 431 homes\\nHousing for students: 782 beds at the University of Victoria\\n\\nLearn More:\\n\\nFor an overview of BC Housing’s work to monitor and respond to COVID-19, visit:\\xa0https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For more information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAgriculture,\\xa0seafood, and food processing businesses in British Columbia can begin to access consulting and planning services to help with COVID-19 response and recovery, through a program offered by the federal and provincial governments.The latest\\xa0intake of the B.C. Agri-Business Planning Program is open to applications and has been expanded to include aquaculture and seafood companies in developing COVID-19 business recovery plans.“The Government of Canada is working around the clock, along with the provinces and territories, to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 on farmers and food businesses,” said Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. “This investment will help B.C. farmers and processors who are experiencing income loss steer the course to recovery and continue to put high-quality food on our grocery store shelves and kitchen tables for years to come.”B.C. agriculture, seafood and food processing business owners are encouraged to apply if their revenues have decreased\\xa0by at least 30% as a result of COVID-19. The funding available includes up to $5,000 in business planning services and coaching for individuals, and up to $20,000 for groups, from a qualified business consultant, to develop an immediate and long-term recovery plan. Eligible applicants may also apply to the specialized business planning stream of the program to further strengthen their business.“This a difficult time for all Canadians and that includes B.C. farmers, ranchers, seafood and food processors,” said Lana Popham, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture. “I have been working with my federal colleague on ways to help people who are experiencing income loss through the pandemic, and the expansion of the B.C. Agri-Business Planning Program is a result of this commitment. We will continue to look at ways to help our industry grow the high-quality local food that we depend on.”Funding for the B.C. Agri-Business Planning Program is provided through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership. The partnership is a five-year federal-provincial-territorial agreement that includes $2 billion in cost-shared strategic initiatives delivered by the provinces and territories, and $1 billion for federal programs and services through March 2023. The new activities related to fish, seafood and aquaculture companies are not eligible for funding under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership. Funding for activities related to fish, seafood and aquaculture companies will be provided by the B.C. Ministry of Agriculture through the B.C.

       "  '\\n\\nAnne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism, has issued the following statement in response to the increase in hate crimes and incidents towards people of Asian heritage in B.C.:\"I am deeply saddened by the recent rise in racially motivated physical and verbal attacks and vandalism against people of Asian heritage in our province since the COVID-19 outbreak. The Vancouver Police Department reported an increase in hate crimes and hate-motivated incidents for March and April, and the majority of those disturbing incidents had an anti-Asian element.“I cannot remain silent. As someone who moved to Canada from Taiwan, I am outraged that anyone would engage in acts of discrimination, hate or violence. I am compelled as a government representative, immigrant and British Columbian to speak out against these vicious acts. \\xa0“COVID-19 is impacting all of us. These are unprecedented challenging times, but I want to be clear – acts of violence and aggression will not be tolerated. There is absolutely no place for hate in our society.“Chinese Canadians have deep roots in this province. Over many generations, Chinese Canadians have worked alongside all British Columbians to build the vibrant, multicultural society we enjoy today. Now is a time to stand together and condemn these actions that seek to divide.“Kindness will bring us through this global health crisis stronger than ever as we work to build a more inclusive and welcoming province. Our communities get stronger when we treat each other as we want to be treated. More than ever, it is critical we are intentional about being supportive, understanding and respectful to one another. We must speak up when we witness racism.“Our government has created new programs to protect, defend and uphold B.C.’s multicultural society. We recently established the Resilience BC anti-racism network, a hub and spoke model designed to connect communities throughout the province with information, supports and training to assist them in addressing racism, intolerance and hate.“We are investing $540,000 annually in Resilience BC. Earlier this month, we selected the Victoria Immigrant and Refugee Centre Society\\xa0as the hub provider, and any community organizations interested in leading anti-racism and anti-hate efforts as a Resilience BC community spoke are encouraged to submit proposals by May 19, 2020.“If you are a victim or witness a hate activity, I encourage you to report the incident to your local police.

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.\"Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 878 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,149 in the Fraser Health region, 126 in the Island Health region, 181 in the Interior Health region and 58 in the Northern Health region.\"We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 135 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to the family, friends\\xa0and caregivers of these individuals, and to everyone who has lost their loved ones.\"There have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 15 facilities and four acute-care units have active cases. The outbreak has now been declared over at the MSA rehab acute-care unit in the Fraser Health region.\"Public health teams are continuing to provide support for community outbreaks in the poultry sector, at the Mission Institution and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“We are transitioning into Phase 2 of BC\\'s Restart Plan\\xa0slowly, with careful thought and consideration. While many of us would look to plan our summer activities well in advance, this year, with the risks of COVID-19 around us, we need to take things week by week.“Less travel right now is what we are asking of everyone. There are so many activities and places for us to safely enjoy – close to home. Rain or shine, we can get outside and enjoy some of the best of B.C. right in our backyards.“Top of mind for all of us needs to be: fewer faces, smaller groups, shorter time together and bigger spaces. Always thinking about location, duration and our relations will help to keep all of us safe.“Let’s use this May long weekend as an opportunity for everyone to put our safe social interaction ‘rules’ into action. A safe path ahead is based on your personal circumstances and your actions.“Let’s keep our curve flat and keep our province strong – together.”Learn More:To participate in the BC Centre for Disease Control\\'s COVID-19 survey, Your story, our future, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/covid-19-survey\\xa0\\nFor those who cannot complete the survey online, or need assistance in another language, call 1 833 707-1900 to take the survey over the phone.

       "  \"\\n\\nToday, Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs and the provincial and federal governments signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that recognizes Wet’suwet’en rights and title throughout the Yintah and sets out a process to negotiate an agreement on how to implement them.“With this MOU, we will now begin to work toward a better understanding between Canada and British Columbia,\\xa0and we will be able to strengthen better relationships and establish strong economies. Wet’suwet’en People, regardless of political views and opinions can now visualize certainty. Wet’suwet’en traditions and culture will always remain with the confines of Wet’suwet’en language. Our priorities are to: mobilize safety measures for all Wet’suwet’en People, promulgate Wet’suwet’en existence and sanctify our inviolable Wet’suwet’en traditions,” said Wet’suwet’en Dinï’ze Woos, (Frank Alec), Cas Yihk, Gitdumt’en (Bear Clan).Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs; Scott Fraser, B.C.’s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation; and Carolyn Bennett, federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, signed the MOU on May 14, 2020, via videoconference. The MOU was signed virtually to respect guidelines from public health officials to protect the health and well-being of people and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.“The MOU is the start of a negotiation process. We have a great deal of work ahead of us to determine how we will implement rights and title together, and reunification within Wet’suwet’en Nation is key to this work moving forward successfully. We are approaching these negotiations with respect and recognition, and have committed to working together with transparency and openness for the benefit of all people who live in the Yintah,” said Fraser.The MOU commits Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs and the provincial and federal governments to negotiate a series of agreements that will resolve matters of rights and title outstanding for decades since the 1997 Supreme Court of Canada Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa ruling. Any formal agreements reached as a result of negotiations will require approval by each of the parties.“The signing of this MOU marks an important step in our work to rebuild our relationship with the Wet’suwet’en and towards affirming and implementing their rights and title. As negotiations begin, a comprehensive, inclusive and transparent engagement process will support the parties so they can work together towards a final agreement on the affirmation and implementation of Wet’suwet’en rights and title. These discussions are breathing life into the 1997 Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa decision, which is part of our country’s work on the path of reconciliation,” said Bennett.As outlined in the MOU, the three parties will now begin negotiating an agreement on a path to implement Wet’suwet’en rights and title. Topics to be discussed will include Nation reunification, revenue-sharing, compensation, land and resources, child and family wellness, water, fish, land-use planning and decision-making.Planning is currently underway to establish both internal Wet’suwet’en and external engagement processes to ensure transparency and openness throughout the negotiations. Wet’suwet’en clan members and elected representatives, neighbouring First Nations, municipal governments and other interested parties who live and work in the Yintah, will be included.The MOU and all future agreements will uphold the Aboriginal rights and title recognized and affirmed by Section 35 of the Constitution and align with B.C.’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.Quotes:Dinï’ze Madeek (Jeff Brown), Gitdumt’en (Bear) –“This is a historic event.

We are here to continue on with that work.”Dinï’ze Kloum Khun (Alphonse Gagnon), Laksamshu (Fireweed and Owl) –“It’s a long time coming, in my lifetime since the early 1970s when we felt ok to start defending ourselves. We have had many Chiefs that were ahead of us, and I would like to thank them. The plaintiffs in the Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa case were very passionate about the Yintah, about our ownership and rights and title. We have tried negotiations before and it didn’t work well. It’s important to thank all the people that supported us, the Mohawks, Gitxsan, and all across Canada, and the youth especially. We have a lot of work ahead of us.”Dinï’ze Smogelgem (Warner Naziel), Laksamshu (Fireweed and Owl) – “For 200 years, colonization came through our lands in many deadly and detrimental ways. We have survived those deadly waves of disease and harmful colonial laws. Throughout these generations of dehumanizing racist policies, we have always conducted ourselves in the selfless and respectful ways according to our ancient laws. Our Nation deserves to experience true sovereignty and we can finally teach our children a new history from this day forth.”Elder Christine William, on behalf of Dinï’ze Hagwilnegh (Ron Mitchell), Laksilyu (Small Frog) –“We are so proud and humbled by the wisdom and determination of my late mother Madeline Alfred, and all that hard work in the Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa court case. It wasn’t about her; it was for our people, it was for all our grandchildren and Yintah.”Dinï’ze Knedebeas (Warner William), Unistot’en (Big Frog) –“Signing this thing doesn’t mean it’s a done deal. For my mother-in law, cousin and all those that participated in the court case –\\xa0in the time to come, we need to participate in this to work, for all of us, for those yet to come.”Dinï’ze Na’Moks (John Ridsdale), Tsayu (Beaver) –“We are doing this for everyone.

       "  '\\n\\nA review of ICBC’s financial situation since the start of the provincial state of emergency shows both positive and negative financial impacts on ICBC’s bottom line. \\xa0With almost no capital reserves to withstand fluctuations and volatility in the markets, it is too early to determine whether the pandemic will result in benefits to pass on to drivers.“ICBC is in a challenging position due to the pandemic, faced with uncertain and unprecedented turmoil in the markets, combined with no financial buffer as a result of the old government’s mismanagement,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “There are more than 10 months to go in the fiscal year and many unknowns, but if ICBC’s bottom line ends up better than expected, any surplus will be used to benefit B.C. drivers. In the meantime, we’re focused on supporting people through payment deferrals and making it easier for people to cancel or change their insurance, and on bringing in Enhanced Care coverage next year to save people an average of $400 on their insurance.”If ICBC’s net income results are better than forecast for 2020-21, any additional net income will benefit customers. Any decisions on the use of additional net income of ICBC for the year due to lower claims resulting from the pandemic will be made at\\xa0the end of the fiscal year. Options could include rebuilding the financial capital health of ICBC to reduce longer-term pressure on rates, providing a one-time direct relief to customers or any combination thereof.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0ICBC’s report on the impacts of COVID-19 examined a period of about six weeks after the provincial state of emergency was declared and people were advised to stay home (March 15 to May 2). It found that over that time:\\nICBC opened 46% fewer accident claims (including claims for both damage to vehicles and for injuries) compared to the same time last year, with an average weekly reduction of 7,200 claims. This drop in the number of claims amounts to approximately $158 million in savings for ICBC. However, claim numbers are on the rise again as more vehicles return to B.C. roads;\\nmore\\xa0than 150,000 customers changed their insurance policies by cancelling their policy (103,700) or lowering their rate class (57,561), resulting in a projected $283-million decline in written insurance premiums compared to what would normally be received for that period; and\\nICBC has seen a decrease in the value of its investment portfolio due to the unprecedented downturn in the financial markets, putting pressure on its bottom line. Some of this has already been seen at the end of ICBC’s 2019-20 fiscal year, and early indications suggest the impact could exceed $1 billion in fiscal 2020-21, depending on the length and scope of the global market downturn. The final impact will be determined at the end of fiscal 2020-21.\\n“ICBC waiving cancellation and re-plating fees alone during the pandemic has saved customers around $5 million, and we will continue to work with those drivers facing financial hardship,” said Nicolas Jimenez, ICBC president and CEO. “We’re committed to delivering essential services and ensuring the safety of our customers, employees and partners. And given these uncertain times, we have a responsibility to consider many factors when making long-term decisions that could adversely affect ICBC’s bottom line – and customers’ insurance premiums – in the future.”ICBC remains focused on the longer-term goal of implementing enhanced care coverage and delivering an average 20% rate reduction in 2021 should the legislation be passed. As ICBC transitions to this new care-based model, no basic rate change was needed this year. The 0% basic rate change that took effect on April 1, 2020, is the lowest in nearly a decade.ICBC has taken a number of steps to support its customers during this challenging time. It has waived cancellation and re-plating fees, provided 90-day deferrals and helped customers to cancel or change their coverage at no charge, among many other initiatives designed to ease the financial burden people may be facing.Learn More:Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on ICBC report: http://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Documents/COVID19-impacts-report-May2020.pdfICBC waives cancellation and re-plating fees: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-apr16.aspxICBC defers payments by 90 days: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-mar24.aspxInsurance renewable by phone: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-mar18.aspxICBC reinstates some knowledge tests by appointment: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-apr27.aspxICBC suspends road tests: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-mar17.aspxTranslations:For a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.14_NR_ICBC_Covid_Finances-CN.pdfFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.14_NR_ICBC_Covid_Finances-FR.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.14_NR_ICBC_Covid_Finances-Punjabi.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAs the May long weekend approaches, government reminds people to avoid all non-essential travel in the province to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and instead stay local if you do decide to enjoy the outdoors.Though some restrictions are expected to ease next week, it remains vital for everyone to maintain physical distancing and take other important measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. This includes staying home if you have any symptoms of illness, washing your hands frequently with soap and water, and not touching your face.\\xa0Here are some tips to help you enjoy the long weekend while following the public safety guidelines set by the provincial health officer (PHO):Have fun close to homeNow is not the time to travel for tourism or recreation. By continuing to avoid non-essential travel, British Columbians can do their part to protect vulnerable people in communities from COVID-19. Things to keep in mind over this long weekend include:\\nDo not visit vacation properties:\\nNow is not the time to camp, or to travel to secondary homes or vacation properties in other communities. Access to resources and health care may be more challenging in smaller communities if someone should become ill or if there’s a community outbreak. By staying home and maintaining physical distancing, British Columbians can take pressure off the already strained resources in these smaller areas.\\nDo not go pleasure boating right now\\nRecreational mariners are reminded to avoid non-essential trips on the water and stay close to home. Each call search-and-rescue specialists respond to puts them at risk of exposure to COVID-19, as well as requiring them to use precious supplies of personal protective equipment. As well, boaters should be aware that some small coastal First Nations communities have closed their villages to visitors to protect themselves from COVID-19, so boaters may not have access to fuel, supplies and other services.\\nBC Ferries service is reduced on many routes\\nBC Ferries is reminding people that ferries are available for essential travel only this long weekend. If you are required to travel right now,\\xa0remember that BC Ferries service has been reduced on many routes, and COVID-19 screening is a Transport Canada requirement for sailings over 30 minutes in duration. Before you travel, check sailing schedules. Reservations are strongly recommended. To support physical distancing, people can remain in their vehicles on both upper and enclosed lower decks.\\nOnly visit your local provincial park or recreation site \\nAs of May 14, 2020, all provincial campgrounds remain closed and most provincial parks, recreation sites and trails are open for day-use only. Access to beaches, trails, most picnic areas and washroom facilities, and boat launches is permitted. However, in keeping with public health guidelines around non-essential travel, people are urged to only visit parks and recreation sites close to their home and avoid travelling to small communities.Some parks will remain closed due to potential challenges with high numbers of anticipated visitors. If you get to your favorite park and find it busy, come back another time.\\nCheck out your local farmers\\xa0market \\nSupporting local producers and food suppliers, choosing to Buy BC is as important as ever. Under the public health officer’s orders and guidelines, farmers\\xa0markets can and are continuing to operate in B.C. at this time. The BC Association of Farmers’ Markets is also helping to provide customers with locally grown and prepared food products through a new online platform. More than 40 farmers\\xa0markets are connected virtually to serve their communities.\\nEnjoy the outdoors safely \\nPlacing extra attention on staying safe in the outdoors will support the health and safety of everyone, including first responders such as BC Wildfire staff, search-and-rescue volunteers, paramedics and other emergency staff.\\nSmall campfires are allowed but other burning prohibitions remain in place\\nResponding to unnecessary, human-caused wildfires could increase the risk of BC Wildfire Service staff being exposed to COVID-19 and potentially affect their response capability at the height of the wildfire season.Campfires are currently allowed within the BC Wildfire Service’s jurisdiction but they must not be larger than 0.5 metres in height or width. People who plan to light a campfire as they enjoy day-use activities at provincial parks and recreation sites must remember to fully extinguish it and ensure the ashes are cold to the touch before leaving the area.Prohibitions remain in place for Category 2 open fires, Category 3 open fires, Resource Management Open Fires and other activities (e.g., use of fireworks, sky lanterns, burning barrels and burning cages). In collaboration with provincial public health partners, the Province has extended its own open burning restrictions for all High Smoke Sensitivity Zones in the province until June 15, 2020.\\xa0\\xa0\\nPlan ahead and stick to well-marked trails \\nDuring the pandemic, there is also higher risk for B.C.’s 2,500 search-and-rescue volunteers as there is a risk of virus transmission during a call to help those who are lost, stranded or injured in B.C.’s outdoors. British Columbians are asked to do their part: do not venture into the wilderness at this time. If you must go outdoors, plan a day trip, stick close to home on well-marked trails, and make sure to pack the right provisions and clothing for the weather.\\nConservation officers will be monitoring activity\\nThroughout the long weekend, conservation officers will continue patrols to ensure public safety and protect B.C.’s environment, fish and wildlife resources. Help them stay safe and do their work by sticking to the rules and report suspected violations to the 24/7 poachers and polluters hotline at 1 877 952-7277.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.Any change to provincial park access or services will be posted to the BC Parks website: http://bcparks.caFor status updates on Recreation Sites and Trails BC campgrounds, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/sports-culture/recreation/camping-hiking/sites-trailsBC Association of Farmers’ Markets online portal: https://bcfarmersmarkettrail.com/markets/?feature%5B%5D=online-farmers-market\\xa0For information on how to prepare your home for a flood, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/preparedbc/know-your-hazards/floodsLearn more about the FireSmart program here: https://firesmartbc.ca/\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

Other work includes improving tunnel drainage to prevent ice build-up and water from pooling at tunnel entrances. The ventilation and electrical systems will also be upgraded. These additional safety improvements are already underway and are scheduled to be completed by spring 2021.Black & McDonald Limited of Vancouver has been awarded a contract valued at $19 million for this work, which is part of a $40-million suite of interim safety and reliability improvements.To minimize delays for drivers, the majority of work will be done at night. Drivers and cyclists are advised to watch for night-time lane closures and obey all traffic-control personnel, construction speed limits and signs. The ministry will let the public know in advance when lane closures are scheduled so they can plan their trip accordingly. People should continue to check DriveBC.ca and @DriveBC on Twitter for the most up-to-date highway travel information.The ministry is working closely with all contractors and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO) has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres apart from each other, both in the course of their duties as well as during breaks. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.While highways and roads remain open, the PHO recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.Learn More:For more information, visit: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/masseytunnel/For guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNTFor travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nBoat inspection stations are opening at various locations throughout the province to prevent harmful zebra and quagga mussels from hitching a boat ride and entering B.C. waterways.From now until late October, inspectors with the B.C. Conservation Officer Service (COS) will check boats for aquatic invasive species and educate people about the importance of Clean, Drain and Dry – a preventative step that all boaters should practise when moving between lakes in B.C.While most provincial boat launches are now open, the Province reminds people that now is not the time for non-essential travel and to stay close to home. Due to current travel restrictions, the risk for invasive mussels entering B.C. is expected to be lower.“We recognize people are eager to get outside and many are ready to head to their favourite lake, but we need to avoid non-essential travel during these unprecedented times and stay close to home,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We are fortunate there have been no reports of quagga and zebra mussels so far in B.C., and we need to make sure it stays that way by ensuring the necessary resources are in place to protect our economy, our infrastructure and our sensitive ecosystems.”Piloted in 2015, the Invasive Mussel Defence program consists of three main components: watercraft inspections, lake monitoring, and public outreach and education. The COS enforces the program and has two detection dogs, Kilo and Major. The dogs are primarily on the road searching for invasive mussels at the inspection stations.Last year, more than 52,000 inspections were conducted that resulted in 22 mussel-fouled boats coming from Ontario, Michigan, Utah and North Carolina\\xa0and were destined for the Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island, Kootenays, Thompson-Nicola and Skeena regions. The program received advanced notification of 17 of the 22 mussel-fouled boats either from another jurisdiction or by Canada Border Services agents.“While we are all protecting ourselves during this unusual time, each of us can take simple actions to protect our waters from invasive species,” said Dave Bennett, chair of the Invasive Species Council of BC. “This weekend kicks off the Clean, Drain, Dry week for Invasive Species Action Month in B.C. Whether you are a paddler, boater\\xa0or a fisher, let’s continue to work together and make sure all of our equipment and vehicles are clean, drained and dry before going to a new waterbody.”The COS\\xa0reminds people that it is mandatory for anyone transporting a watercraft (sailboats, motorboats, car toppers, kayaks, canoes and paddle boats) in B.C. to stop at an open inspection station. Failing to stop can result in a $345 fine. Last year, 116 violation tickets were issued to motorists failing to stop at inspection stations.People are encouraged to report watercraft suspected of transporting invasive mussels to the Report All Poachers and Polluters (RAPP) line at 1 877 952-7277. To determine if a boat is high risk and should be decontaminated, contact: COS.Aquatic.Invasive.Species@gov.bc.caPeople can also report other potential invasive species through the provincial Report Invasives App at:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/invasive-speciesQuick Facts:\\nQuagga and zebra mussels have been found in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, as well as dozens of states in the United States.\\nUnlike B.C.’s native mussels, zebra and quagga mussels attach to hard surfaces, allowing them to move between waterbodies by boats and equipment. The mussels multiply rapidly and are extremely difficult to eradicate once they become established in an area.\\nThe economic impact of invasive mussels to hydropower, agricultural irrigation, municipal water supplies and recreational boating could cost the province an estimated $43 million per year if introduced into B.C. This does not include additional impacts on commercial and recreational fisheries.\\nIn 2019, approximately 892 water samples were collected from 79 lakes across the province. All samples have come back negative for invasive mussels.\\nLearn More:For more information about the Invasive Mussel Defence Program, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/invasive-mussels/invasive-mussel-defence-programFor more information about the Clean, Drain, Dry program, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/invasive-mussels/what-can-you-doFor more information on the Invasive Species Council of BC and how to get involved with the Clean, Drain, Dry program, visit https://bcinvasives.ca/resources/programs/clean-drain-dryFor more information about zebra and quagga mussels, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/invasive-mussels/zebra-and-quagga-mussel-facts\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

During the last two weeks of the provincial state of emergency, government has taken action to support British Columbians by:\\nsupporting over 400 people’s transition from unsafe encampments in Oppenheimer Park in Vancouver, and Topaz Park and the Pandora corridor in Victoria, into safer, temporary accommodation as a first step toward more secure housing;\\nopening applications for the B.C.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Province is supporting jobs for B.C. workers in oil and gas service companies to clean up the environment and help restart the economy.“With the support of the federal government, B.C. is taking action to accelerate the restoration of more than 2,000 orphan and inactive wells,” said Premier John Horgan. “This program will support upwards of 1,200 jobs, helping B.C. workers, the environment and our economy during these challenging times.”On April 17, 2020, the Government of Canada announced $120 million\\xa0for B.C. to support cleaning up oil and gas sites. Subject to reaching final agreement with Canada, the Province intends to invest this funding in three new programs:\\nThe Dormant Sites Reclamation Program will provide $100 million to reclaim dormant oil and gas sites, which are wells that have been inactive for five consecutive years and are unlikely to be returned to service. This program will provide up to $100,000, or 50% of total costs, whichever is less.\\n\\nThe Orphan Sites Supplemental Reclamation Program will provide $15 million to reclaim orphan oil and gas sites where the operator is insolvent, no longer exists or cannot be located. This program will be administrated by the BC Oil and Gas Commission (BCOGC) and will be in addition to $27 million in planned BCOGC clean up of such wells for 2020-21.\\n\\nThe Legacy Sites Reclamation Program will provide $5 million to address the legacy impacts of historical oil and gas activities that continue to have environmental impacts, such as on wildlife habitat\\xa0or on the traditional use by Indigenous peoples.\\nThese programs will be open to oil and gas field service companies and contractors based in B.C., with registration, office and operations in B.C.“Through these three programs, we are accelerating the cleanup of thousands of orphan and inactive wells,” said Bruce Ralston, B.C.\\'s Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “This allows us to restore lands of important environmental and cultural relevance, while also supporting local jobs and local economies in B.C.’s northeast.”Indigenous communities, local governments and landowners will be able to nominate dormant, orphan and legacy sites for priority consideration for decommissioning, reclamation or restoration.“Thanks to the co-operation between the governments of Canada and British Columbia, this program will mean a cleaner environment and much needed jobs for workers in B.C.,” said\\xa0Seamus O’Regan, Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources.Applications for the Dormant Sites Reclamation Program will be accepted beginning May 25.Quotes:Chief Trevor Makadahay, Doig River First Nation – “Doig River is pleased that the Province of B.C. is making steps to further manage the impacts of development on our territory through reclamation and restoration programs. We are committed to cleaning up our land base and look forward to exploring the opportunities these programs create for our band membership, our company Uujo Developments and our environmental partner Tervita Corporation.”Chief Sharleen Gale, Fort Nelson First Nation (FNFN) – \\xa0\"The Fort Nelson First Nation is pleased to hear the announcement from the B.C. government about the new dormant and orphan well restoration programs.\\xa0This is a win-win for the oil and gas sector and the environment. It will bring much needed local employment for former oil and gas workers and clean up dormant, legacy and orphan wells. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with B.C. to reclaim old wells to the highest standards using innovative techniques that the FNFN and the BCOGC have been piloting over the past two years.”Chief Ken Cameron, Saulteau First Nations – \\xa0“We have been working with B.C. and the BCOGC on developing new approaches to restoration, and we welcome new programs that will support reclamation projects and job creation.\\xa0We are ready to share our traditional knowledge, technical expertise\\xa0and project management skills.\\xa0We believe that by working together with government and industry, we can create long-term sustainable economies and restore landscapes to their natural state, after oil and gas activities are completed.”Chief Roland Willson, West Moberly First Nations –“These funds can help restore some of the impacted areas of Treaty 8 territory and provide economic opportunities to West Moberly people.”Elizabeth Aquin, interim president and CEO of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada (PSAC) – “The funding program announced today will provide much needed jobs for the oil and gas services sector companies that PSAC represents while also generating positive environmental outcomes. The services sector is instrumental in developing new technologies and innovation to improve environmental performance.\\xa0PSAC is pleased that this funding aligns with our advocacy for a mechanism to close orphan and inactive wells to create jobs during this unprecedented downturn. This will also help to retain key skills and expertise for Canada’s responsible energy development and stewardship of the land.”Karen Tam Wu, regional director, British Columbia, Pembina Institute – \\xa0“Amid these difficult times, today\\'s announcement represents a welcome opportunity to get people back to work quickly and to take action on\\xa0dormant, legacy\\xa0and orphaned gas wells in British Columbia. Going forward, it\\'s essential to enforce the polluter-pays principle to prevent taxpayers from bearing the cost of future cleanup for these wells. Strengthening British Columbia’s liability management program could ensure the risks posed by neglected infrastructure\\xa0doesn\\'t keep growing.”Quick Facts:\\nOf about 25,000 oil and gas well sites in B.C., approximately 357 are considered orphan. In addition, there are currently 7,685 dormant well sites in B.C.\\nThe decommissioning and restoration of oil and gas sites in B.C. is regulated by the BCOGC, which last year developed a Comprehensive Liability Management Plan.\\nWhen a site is designated an orphan, the BCOGC can use the industry-funded Orphan Site Reclamation Fund to decommission and restore the land.\\nOn April 16, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the BCOGC announced it is postponing invoicing of the Orphan Liability Levy. The Levy will still be charged for the 2020-21 year, but invoicing will be deferred until Sept. 1.\\nLearn More:More information on the Comprehensive Liability Management Plan can be found at: https://www.bcogc.ca/comprehensive-liability-management-plan.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

He was a man of integrity, who had a joy for life and a commitment to leave the world a better place.\"Ralph cared very much about the safety of workers, and over the span of a long career,\\xa0he was ambitious and energetic when it came to protecting those in the workplace. Ralph’s legacy spans the globe — he made a tremendous difference in mining safety, health and environmental protection as far away as Australia, South America and Africa.\"Closer to home, Ralph held many leadership roles at WorkSafeBC. One of his greatest achievements was overseeing the revision of B.C.’s Occupational Health and Safety Regulations, which came into effect in 1998. His work resulted in systemic improvements that we still benefit from today. It was this leadership in workers’ compensation that led me to appoint him as chair of the board of directors of WorkSafeBC in 2017, where he was driving work to achieve our vision to make workplaces the safest in Canada. I appreciate his dedication to this goal, which I commit will continue.\"On behalf of the Ministry of Labour, I offer my heartfelt condolences to his family, friends\\xa0and all his colleagues who are mourning his passing.

       "  'Over 70 new affordable homes opening in Saanich',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nLow- to moderate-income families, individuals, seniors and adults with disabilities in Saanich will soon have access to over 70 new affordable homes thanks to a partnership between the Province, the Capital Regional District (CRD) and the Capital Region Housing Corporation (CRHC).“Affordable housing is needed in our community now more than ever,” said Lana Popham, MLA for Saanich South. “These 73 new homes will make a big difference and provide security and peace of mind for the people who will call this building home.”Located at 3816 Carey Rd., Westview is a four-storey, wood-frame building with 73 homes. The building provides studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments. Fifteen of the homes will be for people with very low incomes (rented at the provincial income assistance rate); 29 will be rent-geared-to-income units (where people with low to moderate incomes will pay 30% of their income); and 29 will be rented at affordable rates. Westview is located near community facilities, retail areas and transit.The CRHC will own and operate the building and is partnering with the Independent Living Housing Society to provide five fully accessible ground-floor units, as well as an office for the society’s programming. The society will select residents for the five designated accessible units. The CRHC is also partnering with Threshold Housing Society to provide two units to youth at risk of homelessness.Residents will begin moving into their new homes on May 15, 2020. To ensure resident safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, move-in dates and times are staggered to ensure residents have minimal contact with each other in hallways and elevators.Quotes:Lisa Helps, chair, CRHC – “As the largest social housing provider in the region, the CRHC is proud to deliver affordable housing and services to almost 3,500 residents. We are a strong community partner that works collaboratively with stakeholders and tenants to build safe, vibrant and accessible communities like Westview.”\\n\\nFred Haynes, mayor of Saanich –“The District of Saanich is delighted to be stepping up again with BC Housing and the CRD to enable more affordable homes. Saanich is already home to many supported, assisted and affordable homes. From the wonderful opportunities for co-op housing right through to homes, we are proud to be part of providing this support.”Heidi Bada, board of directors president, Independent Living Housing Society –“We are delighted to see Westview\\xa0reaching the occupancy stage and are grateful for the opportunity to again collaborate with Capital Region Housing. Finding a place to live can be particularly challenging for people with disabilities especially when accessible housing is a necessary requirement.\\xa0The Independent Living Housing Society believes that good living starts with home, and this housing development provides an opportunity for us to support more people with disabilities to make a home in this community.”Colin Tessier, executive director, Threshold Housing Society –“We are excited to partner with the Capital Region Housing Corporation on the Westview housing project. There is a desperate need for safe and affordable housing options for at-risk youth in our community, and this project is helping to address that critical need. Youth housed at Westview will receive robust support services and access to positive community through the Threshold support program. Access to safe housing and appropriate supports for at-risk youth is a key strategy to preventing future instances of adult homelessness.”Quick Facts:\\nThe Province provided $8.5 million in construction financing\\xa0and $7.1 million in grants.\\nThe Capital Regional District provided the land for the project and $1 million in cash equity.\\nThe Capital Region Housing Corporation is a wholly owned non-profit subsidiary of the CRD with a housing portfolio of 1,491 affordable housing units. \\xa0\\nIncluding these 73 homes, the Province is working in partnership to build more than 3,330 new affordable homes for people with a range of incomes in the CRD.\\nLearn More:A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/For more information about the Capital Region Housing Corporation, visit: https://www.crd.bc.ca/crhcTo view a backgrounder:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.13_BG_New_Housing.pdf\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nA resurfacing project on highways 6 and 97 near Vernon and Falkland is underway, one of several in the southern Interior that will cover more than 300 kilometres of highways and side roads in 2020.“All these paving projects will make a big difference to residents as well as those who travel through the region,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Moving forward with highway improvement projects means we are providing jobs for British Columbians, but in all of these projects, safety comes first.”B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO) has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres apart from each other, both in the course of their duties and during breaks. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.This first project involves hot-in-place asphalt recycling for a total of 43 kilometres, including one segment of Highway 6 between Vernon and Lumby, two segments of Highway 97 near Vernon and two segments of Highway 97 near Falkland. Work on this $7.2-million project is underway and is expected to be complete this summer.Hot-in-place resurfacing is a made-in-B.C. process that involves repurposing the existing asphalt by heating, softening and blending it with a small amount of new asphalt before reapplying it to the road surface. This method extends the life of the surface, is faster, saves resources and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.Other major resurfacing projects for the region this spring and summer include:\\nHighway 3 near Castlegar – sealcoating\\xa0approximately 25 kilometres of Highway 3,\\xa0Bombi Pass between the Ootischenia weigh scales and Beaver Creek bridge;\\nHighway 5 near Barriere - resurfacing approximately 16 kilometres of Highway 5 from McLure Ferry Road to Louis Creek Bridge;\\nHighway 97A and side roads near Salmon Arm – approximately 13 kilometres of resurfacing on Highway 97A from Enderby to Grindrod, along with portions of Mabel Lake Road, Trinity Valley Road and Springbend Road; and\\nside roads near Creston – approximately 24 kilometres of side road resurfacing in the Lister area, as well as some of Highway 21, including patch paving for five kilometres near the Canada-U.S. border.\\nMore than $85 million is being invested in highway and side road improvements in the southern Interior in 2020. The following projects make up the rest of what will be resurfaced in the region this year:\\nHighway 1, 93/95 near Radium Hot Springs and Golden (23 kilometres) – hot-in-place resurfacing from Windermere to Radium and in the Golden area;\\nHighway 3A near Nelson (20 kilometres) – resurfacing from Kootenay Lake Bridge to Taghum Bridge and side roads;\\nHighway 5 near Merritt (10 kilometres) – resurfacing from Great Bear Snowshed to Dry Gulch Bridge;\\nHighway 20 near Williams Lake (28 kilometres) – sealcoating from the Sheep Creek Brake Check to Hodgson Road;\\nHighway 95A near Cranbrook (18 kilometres) – resurfacing from Cranbrook to Marysville including some side roads;\\nHighway 97 near Quesnel (33 kilometres) – intermittent resurfacing between McLeese Lake and Dale Lake;\\nHighway 97 near Vernon (10 kilometres) – highway resurfacing from north of 43rd Avenue to College Way and along Old Kamloops Road; and\\nHighway 97C near Merritt (12 kilometres) – mill-and-fill resurfacing from the Highway 5A Junction (Aspen Grove) to Pothole Creek Bridge.\\nWhile highways and roads remain open, the PHO recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.As these resurfacing projects are taking place, drivers can expect minor delays and, at times, single-lane alternating traffic. The ministry appreciates people’s patience during this resurfacing work. Drivers are reminded to obey construction zone speed limits and the direction of traffic control personnel.

       "  'Our B.C. testing strategy for COVID-19: adapting to our pandemic',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nTesting for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases is a core tenet of public health.It tells us the what, who and where of disease transmission, but we need to understand the limitations of testing to do this right. \\xa0Many have asked and many continue to ask about who is getting tested for COVID-19 in B.C. and why we don’t just “test, test, test everyone.” What I can tell you is we adapted our testing approach as we learned more about the virus and the test, and as more tests became available, and we will continue to adapt as we progress through our pandemic response.Scientists at the BC Centre for Disease Control were some of the first in the world to develop a COVID-19 test – the “what” in our testing strategy. This test detects the genetic material of the virus in a sample (usually a swab taken from the back of the nose) from someone who is sick. It is used across Canada and around the world to determine if someone is infected.Initially, B.C.’s testing strategy was based on identifying the source of transmission to understand who was getting and spreading the virus to guide our response.That’s why we first focused on returning travellers, in combination with leveraging our annual active influenza surveillance testing. This allowed us to put in place the necessary precautions, orders and restrictions we have today.As the pandemic progressed in B.C. and we had evidence of community transmission, we adapted our testing strategy to focus on those most vulnerable to serious illness from COVID-19.We did this because we knew the “where” of transmission was now potentially “everywhere.” We also knew that many people with mild illness don’t need tests and can safely self-isolate and recover at home.So, we concentrated on the sickest patients, health-care workers, those in long-term care homes and those connected to an outbreak. This gave us an understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on hospitals and care homes.Of course, testing is not the only public health strategy. Step in step with testing is the contact tracing that our public health teams always do and will continue to do as we transition to Phase 2 in BC’s Restart Plan. This is vital to setting up a firewall around every case and breaking the chains of transmission.As our rate of new cases slowed into mid-April, we adapted our strategy again to broader community testing. This means anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 can now be tested.It’s still important to remember not everybody needs a test and the tests we have are not perfect. If someone tests negative, it may mean they are too early in the illness for the test to detect it yet – a false negative.When we have a small number of people who actually have COVID-19 in the population, the number of false positives can also be very high. That means we are telling people they are infected and maybe immune to COVID-19 when they aren’t.What’s next? Soon we will introduce a \"serology\" test that can tell us if someone has been infected with COVID-19 in the past and has developed antibodies to the virus. Once the serology test has been validated for accuracy, the test results will be used to get a better sense of where the virus has been and how to further prevent its spread as we move into the next phase of our pandemic.Understanding the limitations of the tests, our strategy has never been about just testing everyone, but rather using the tests we have to understand who is or has been infected, so we can best protect our families, health-care system and communities.Our strategy is working, even as we develop it further to meet our evolving needs. It is adapted to our pandemic experience that is helping all of us to hold the line and get through this storm. It will continue to support us as we move through the next phases of this challenging pandemic.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nHalalt First Nation will benefit from immediate and future economic opportunities with the purchase of two commercial properties in North Cowichan, supported through funding from the provincial government.“Halalt has\\xa0been part of the treaty process for more than 25 years,” said Chief James Thomas of Halalt First Nation. “So the transfer of these lands is more than an economic opportunity. It’s a commitment that this government is serious about reconciliation with Halalt and going all the way with us toward a treaty.”The purchase of Crofton Corners, a business and residential complex, and Chemainus River Storage, a commercial property, both close to Halalt’s main reserve lands, advance treaty negotiations between the Nation and the Province. Halalt First Nation took ownership of the properties on March 20 and April 27, 2020, respectively.“The Halalt people have been stewards of these lands for millennia,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “Acquiring land to support the Nation’s goals for self-government, strong, healthy communities and economic prosperity is one of the ways we can advance reconciliation – and that work will bring benefits to the entire region.”These properties will allow Halalt First Nation to explore new business partnerships and create economic opportunity along the well-travelled route between Crofton, Chemainus and the Salt Spring Island ferry terminal.\\xa0The Province provided $2.16 million for the land purchases under an Incremental Treaty Agreement (ITA). ITAs offer First Nations within the treaty process an opportunity to take advantage of early treaty benefits, such as purchasing a property of interest.Halalt First Nation is the third of five Nations in the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group to advance treaty negotiations through ITAs with B.C. in the past six months.In January 2020, Penelakut Tribe acquired the former 49th Parallel General Store in Chemainus through an ITA with the Province. The store is located on the traditional lands where Penelakut’s village once stood and is immediately adjacent to the BC Ferries terminal serving Penelakut and Thetis islands. It is a popular spot with travellers and presents Penelakut with future economic development opportunities.Cowichan Tribes purchased the 153-hectare Genoa Bay Farm property through an ITA in October 2019, restoring a significant piece of Cowichan Tribes traditional land base and cultural history. It is a mix of farmland, forest and beachfront, and is connected to Cowichan Tribes reserve lands, providing road access to land previously accessible only by water.Quick Facts:\\nHalalt First Nation has more than 200 members and is located on southeast Vancouver Island, between Crofton and Chemainus.\\nHalalt First Nation purchased Crofton Corners for $1.05 million and Chemainus River Storage for $1.117 million.\\nCrofton Corners is located at the junction of Crofton and Chemainus roads, which connect Chemainus, Crofton and the Salt Spring Island ferry terminal. The property includes a commercial tenant, three two- and three-bedroom apartment suites, and a smaller commercial building with workshop. Chemainus River Storage is currently used for vehicle and boat storage, and offers future commercial development potential.\\nHalalt First Nation is one of five member Nations of the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group, which moved into the final stage of treaty negotiations with the provincial and federal governments in September 2019. The group includes Cowichan Tribes, Penelakut Tribe, Halalt First Nation, Lyackson First Nation and Ts'uubaa-asatx (Lake Cowichan First Nation).\\nLearn More:Halalt First Nation: https://halalt.org/Hul'qumi'num Treaty Group: http://ow.ly/vt4l30proc2\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

It helps farmers, ranchers and food and beverage processors market their products as locally grown, raised, harvested or produced, making it easy for British Columbians to Buy BC.“British Columbians have come together during these difficult times and continue to show their strength and support for each other. With the new Buy BC e-commerce funding, farmers and food and beverage processors can create a new avenue to sell their products directly to consumers all over the province, while maintaining physical distancing and safe practices,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Moving to online sales gives customers the opportunity to continue to Buy BC and enjoy fresh food, while supporting families in our communities.”The program provides financial support to access and develop websites that accommodate online sales and helps cover the costs of marketing and shipping products to consumers throughout the province.“As a farmer, I’ve felt the impact of these uncertain times,” said Cammy Lockwood, Lockwood Farms. “The need to transition to online sales is necessary as farmers can’t rely on traditional methods to get their products to customers, and customers need a way to be able to access the local goods they depend on to feed their families. The support the Buy BC e-commerce funding is providing to help move online, market and get products to consumers is greatly appreciated, especially since this is a very busy season for farmers.”Online applications are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis, from May 15 to May 29, or when the funding is fully subscribed. The provincial government's Buy BC Partnership Program is delivered by the Investment Agriculture Foundation of British Columbia.

       "  '\\n\\nVulnerable people, including people experiencing homelessness, will have better access to services through smartphones distributed by the social service organizations that support them.“The need for internet connectivity has never been as important as it is right now. For people who are experiencing homelessness, the closing of public spaces like libraries due to COVID-19 has reduced connectivity options and created barriers to supports and services,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Providing smartphones for people on the street will help create easier access to those services, help people maintain physical distancing, and support people in staying connected to family and friends during this time.”Through the Homelessness Community Action Grant program and a partnership with 7-Eleven, the Social Planning and Research Council of BC (SPARC BC) has been able to secure 3,500 smartphones to be distributed by community organizations who provide services and support for vulnerable people.The smartphones can connect to Wi-Fi and include a pre-loaded $10 7-Eleven data card, so people have instant access to internet. The smartphones provide vulnerable people better access to vital online resources and services, including arranging medication and safe supply delivery and virtual doctor meetings.To date, 1,000 smartphones have been distributed,\\xa0200 of which will help ensure that people who transitioned from Oppenheimer Park in Vancouver and are transitioning from Pandora Avenue and Topaz Park encampments in Victoria have access to basic communication and the connections they need as they move into safer temporary accommodations. SPARC BC will distribute the additional 2,500 smartphones to organizations and community response networks throughout the province.“Access to basic communication plays a central role in how individuals are able to practise the physical distancing needed under COVID-19,” said Lorraine Copas, executive director, SPARC BC. “Through our partnerships with communities, it became clear that this was a gap in the system – a gap that we were able to fill in partnership with 7-Eleven, who helped us to secure the smartphones at cost.”The Downtown Eastside SRO Collaborative received 500 of the smartphones for low-income residents living in one of the 4,500 single room occupancy (SRO)\\xa0hotel units in the area. Through DTES Response and Central City Foundation, many of these smartphones have been paired with SIM cards donated by TELUS to provide $0 rate plans including unlimited nationwide talk and text and three GB of data per month. In addition to these smartphones, Wi-Fi providers have opened up their existing Wi-Fi networks to the public, including in the Downtown Eastside, to better connect vulnerable people with support.“These smartphones are lifelines and a long-term asset for people living in the Downtown Eastside and SROs. With the smartphones, we are also able to co-ordinate the drop-off of thousands of bars of soap, food and hygiene supplies to people and connect with people about COVID-19 symptoms and testing,” said Wendy Pedersen, coordinator of the Downtown Eastside SRO Collaborative. “We shared the smartphones with other front line organizations and groups in the DTES Response effort who work with people on the ground to provide vital services in the neighbourhood.”In June 2019, the Province provided SPARC BC with $6 million for the Homelessness Community Action Grant program. To date, 53 grants for a total of $1,648,000 have been issued with the average grant amount of $31,094.Homelessness Community Action Grants help groups address homelessness in their towns and cities. SPARC BC is distributing the Homelessness Community Action Grants to groups and organizations over three years as a one-time grant to successful applicants. The chosen projects will build on local resources and knowledge about homelessness and its causes, increase public awareness and support, and respond to gaps in services for people experiencing homelessness.Learn More:Find out more about Homelessness Community Action Grants online at: https://www.sparc.bc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Homelessness-Community-Action-Grants-Application-Form.pdfFor more information about the DTES Response, visit: https://dtesresponse.ca/For more information and the latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter\\n@CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For more information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

COVID-19 has reminded us all of the selflessness, dedication and leadership it takes to be a nurse.“May 12th also marks the 200th anniversary of Florence Nightingale’s birth. As a nurse, she helped lay the foundation for safe, sanitary medical practices in the 19th and 20th centuries, and continues to inspire those who follow in her footsteps to help ease people’s pain and suffering through compassionate care. Nightingale was famously quoted as saying, ‘How very little can be done under the spirit of fear,’ and I think these words can inspire us all to act with courage and determination during the COVID-19 crisis.“On behalf of British Columbians, thank you to B.C.’s nurses for moving heaven and earth to help people with COVID-19 and all the other medical needs that don’t stop during a pandemic. We recognize that you are being pushed to the limit, which is why we must all keep doing our part to protect and support B.C.’s front line workers and our health care system.“Like so many British Columbians, I have been standing on my front porch every evening to bang pots and pans in your honour. I continue to feel sincere gratitude each time. Thank you for everything you do.”For a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.12_STM_International_Nurses_Day-FR.pdfFor a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.12_STM_International_Nurses_Day-TC.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.12_STM_International_Nurses_Day-Punjabi.pdfFor a Tagalog translation: \\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.12_STM_International_Nurses_Day-Tagalog.pdfFor a Korean translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.12_STM_International_Nurses_Day-Korean.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 14 new cases.“This represents 23 new cases since we reported on Saturday, for a total of 2,353 cases in British Columbia.“There are 504 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 1,719 people who tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 66 individuals are hospitalized, 18 of whom are in intensive care.

The fund will be available to local governments, First Nations and non-profits in the region to support local delivery of critical services, such as health and mental health care, housing and child care.\\xa0\\n“The need to invest in northern B.C.’s infrastructure and community services is vital, and this funding has a new and significant role to play in contributing to our province’s economic recovery, especially in light of COVID-19’s impacts on B.C.’s people, communities and economy,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance.This funding is in addition to $100 million provided through the Northern Capital and Planning Grant to communities in the northwest in 2019. It is part of ongoing dialogue between the Province and B.C.’s northwest and north-central communities on how to support the region over the longer term.“People are at the heart of strong, resilient communities and this funding is part of our continued commitment to invest in the hard-working people of the North,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We have been listening to northern communities about their need to be ready to seize the opportunities presented by expected growth and resource development. With this funding, they will be able to plan to tackle both the infrastructure and socio-economic needs their communities are facing.” \\xa0The Northern Capital and Planning Grant and the B.C. Northern Healthy Communities Fund will contribute to a resilient B.C. economy and will complement the $1.5 billion set for economic stimulus as part of B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan.\\xa0Quick Facts:\\nThrough the Northern Capital Planning Grant, eligible local governments can expect to receive the following based on their populations and base assessments:\\nMunicipalities with more than 8,000 people will receive between $5.2 million\\xa0and $6.6 million.\\nMunicipalities with fewer than 8,000 people will receive between $300,000 and $3.7 million.\\n\\nRegional districts will receive between $400,000 and $1.6 million.\\nThe B.C. Northern Healthy Communities Fund will be distributed by the Northern Development Initiative Trust through an application process.\\xa0\\nFor a backgrounder with what local leaders are saying about these grants, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020-Northern-Capital-Planning-Grants_BG.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe Nisg̱a’a Final Agreement, British Columbia’s first modern treaty, came into effect 20 years ago today.The governments of Canada, British Columbia and the Nisg̱a’a Nation commemorate this major milestone on the path of reconciliation.For the Nisg̱a’a people, May 11, 2000, marked the end of a 113-year journey and the first steps toward a brighter future. The Nisg̱a’a Final Agreement is the first treaty in British Columbia to provide constitutional certainty in respect of an Indigenous people’s Section 35 right to self-government. The Treaty recognizes Nisga’a Lands (2,000 square kilometres), secures Nisg̱a’a hunting and fishing rights in the Nass Wildlife Area and Nass Area respectively, and has opened the door for joint economic initiatives in the responsible, sustainable development of the Nisg̱a’a Nation’s natural resources — benefiting the Nisg̱a’a, as well as their fellow British Columbians and Canadians. An example of hope, trust and co-operation, the Nisg̱a’a Final Agreement is being studied by governments and Indigenous peoples the world over.Today, the Nisg̱a’a Nation includes more than 7,600 people residing primarily in the Nisga’a villages of Gingolx, Laxgalts’ap, Gitwinksihlkw and Gitlaxt’aamiks (formerly New Aiyansh) on British Columbia’s northwest coast, as well as in Terrace, Prince Rupert/Port Edward and throughout the Lower Mainland.With the land question settled and their rights secure, the Nisg̱a’a have been busy building their government and institutions, as well as facilitating development, including BC Hydro’s 335-kilometre, 287-kilovolt Northwest Transmission Line; the Long Lake Hydroelectric Project, a 31-megawatt power generation facility; and the Brucejack Mine, an underground gold and silver mine operated by Pretium Resources Inc. Each of these projects has generated employment, business opportunities and revenue.While the 20th anniversary gathering has been postponed due to the COVID-19 crisis, the governments of Canada, British Columbia and the Nisg̱a’a Nation — partners in the Treaty — seek to remind the world of what can be achieved together.Quotes:Carolyn Bennett, federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations – “The 20th anniversary of the implementation of the Nisg̱a’a Treaty is a major milestone in our shared history. Although a great deal has changed in the world around us, the Nisg̱a’a vision for creating a better future for their people has not. The Treaty is a living and breathing example of reconciliation in action and what we can accomplish when we work together and recognize and respect Indigenous people’s right to self-determination.”John Horgan, Premier of British Columbia – “Twenty years is a significant milestone. An entire generation of Nisg̱a’a young people have grown up as members of a self-governing treaty nation. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic means we can’t be together to recognize this special day for the Nisga’a community and the Province, but in honour of Nisg̱a’a Day and the government-to-government relationship we’ve built together over two decades, the Nisga’a flag is flying in the Hall of Honour at the B.C. Parliament Buildings. I thank the Nisg̱a’a Lisims Government for its leadership and congratulate all Nisga’a people on this anniversary.”Scott Fraser, B.C.’s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation – “Two decades ago, the Nisg̱a’a people charted a new path on their journey of self-governance. At the same time, B.C. and Nisg̱a’a reset our relationship to focus on reconciliation, supporting an even-better life for Nisga’a communities and people. I congratulate the Nisg̱a’a leadership on the social, cultural and economic successes of the past 20 years, and look forward to the good work we will do together in the future.”Eva Clayton, President, Nisg̱a’a Lisims Government – “On this special milestone day, may we remember the generations of Nisg̱a’a men and women who worked tirelessly over 113 years for the just and honourable settlement we achieved on May 11, 2000. May we continue to work steadfastly for the prosperity and improved quality of life of Nisg̱a’a for generations yet to come.”\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“In the last day, there have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 15 facilities and five acute-care units have active cases. Outbreaks have been declared over at 19 care facilities, including at Cedarbrook Chateau.“Public health teams are also providing support for community outbreaks in the poultry sector, at the Mission Institution and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“To date, 1,659 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 69 individuals are hospitalized and 21 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“As we celebrate our mothers and grandmothers tomorrow, let’s show how much we care for them by ensuring we are doing all we can to keep them safe.

The nature of COVID-19, with its greater impact on our older citizens, means the best thing you can do to protect yourself is to minimize your contact with others.“For our Elders in long-term care and assisted-living facilities, we are working hard to find innovative ways to allow for that important social connection in a safe way.“ ‘Few faces in big spaces'\\xa0will be\\xa0the key to our shared success.

       "  \"\\n\\nAfter working in child care for more than three decades, Lorraine Trulsen thought she had seen it all, but six weeks ago the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way the world works for the director at Heritage Park Childcare Centre in Mission.“Child care is essential. Families can’t function if they don’t have access to child care they can trust,” Trulsen says.May is Child Care Month in B.C., honouring the work of thousands of\\xa0child care professionals throughout the province.With only one hospital in Mission, Trulsen reached out to the families who attend her centre to see what their child care needs were and how she could help parents who are working on the front lines, fighting COVID-19.When two nurses responded saying they needed child care, Trulsen didn’t hesitate to keep her doors open.“This is the right thing to do, to be there for the first responders, nurses and other essential service workers who need care for their children,” Trulsen says.She did, however, change the way the centre cares for kids, establishing new processes to ensure children, parents and staff stay healthy.The morning drop-off routine now includes hand washing, complete with a 20-second song to make sure the kids have\\xa0fun\\xa0while stopping the spread.While those processes help to ensure the physical health of the children at her centre, Trulsen wants to make sure she is also looking after their emotional health, saying child care is about the whole connection, including the social one.She started a private Facebook group for families at her centre so kids and parents who are no longer attending in person can say hi, share photos and videos, and keep in touch with their friends and educators.Trulsen says its been valuable for her staff, too. They love coming into work and feel like they are part of a big family. As a community-based centre, those enrolled at Heritage Park are part of that family. Staying connected, even virtually, is important for all of them.“I think this situation has shown parents how tough child care can be,” Trulsen says. “It seems like everyone has realized that child care is essential. My staff, they’re the heroes.”Trulsen says it’s been heartwarming to see the community come together during these challenging times and wants essential service workers in Mission to know, “If you need care, we are here. Our centre is your centre.”Quick Facts:\\nIn response to COVID-19, the Province has developed a child care referral system to help parents in essential service roles find licensed child care nearby. Parents can fill out a form to identify their need for urgent care at: www.gov.bc.ca/essential-service-child-care\\n\\t\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Or by calling 1 888 338-6622 and selecting Option 4.\\nParents who are not in an essential service role are asked to care for their children at home if possible, or to complete the above form to find an available space nearby after priority has been given to essential service workers.\\nIn November 2018, Heritage Park Childcare Centre was selected to deliver low-cost child care as a Childcare BC Universal Prototype Site, including 12 infant/toddler spaces and 25 spaces for children aged three to five years.\\nLearn More:For the latest COVID-19 related child care information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/ChildCareCovid-19ResponseFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0 http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non health-related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nWith temperatures rising throughout the province, British Columbians are urged to take steps to prepare for the possibility of flooding.B.C.’s most severe floods usually occur in spring and early summer when melting snow and rain combine. Floods can also be caused by storm surges, ice jams or damage to structures like dikes and dams.Here are some tips to help you and your family prepare for potential flooding:\\n\\nProtect your home: The public is advised to prepare for possible flooding of low-lying areas by moving equipment and other assets to higher ground, where possible. Clear perimeter drains, eavestroughs and gutters. Sandbags help and can be available through your local government.\\nCreate grab-and-go bags: Assemble an individual grab-and-go bag for each member of your household with the essentials they will need if asked to evacuate.\\nRecognize the danger signs: If you live near a waterway, a change in water colour or rapid change in water level (especially a drop) could indicate a problem upstream. Call your local fire, police or public works department immediately if you suspect something out of the ordinary.\\n\\nIf you face a threatening flood situation, park vehicles away from streams and waterways, move electrical appliances to upper floors and anchor fuel supplies. Listen to local officials if you are asked to evacuate. In the event of flooding, here are some tips about what to avoid:\\n\\nSteer clear of river shorelines: \\n\\nKeep away from river edges and shorelines. During periods of high flow, river banks may be unstable and more prone to sudden collapse. Stay well away and keep young children and pets away from the banks of fast-flowing streams and flooded areas or bridges.\\n\\nDo not drive through flood water: \\nNever attempt to drive or walk in flood water. Just 15 centimetres\\xa0(six inches) of fast-moving water can knock over an adult, and 61 centimetres (two feet) of rushing water can carry away most vehicles, including SUVs and pickup trucks.\\n\\nLandslide risk:\\nHeavy rain and snowmelt may contribute to landslides and dangerous debris in creeks and waterways. Be safe and do not go down to watch the rushing water. If you notice trees beginning to lean or bend near your home, or cracks developing in the hillside, consult an engineer or contact local authorities.\\n\\nBritish Columbians can find more details in the new Flood Preparedness Guide released by PreparedBC. The guide contains useful information that will help British Columbians better protect themselves and their homes, and understand what to do if their home or community is at risk of flooding.Learn More:The Flood Preparedness Guide is available online: www.preparedbc.ca/floodsFor tips on how to prepare grab-and-go bags, visit: www.preparedbc.ca/emergencykitFor information on evacuation alerts and orders, visit: www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca\\nOr follow on Twitter: www.twitter.com/EmergencyInfoBC\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Between January 1 and April 30, 2020 there were 15 fire-related fatalities in British Columbia. Over the same period last year, there were five fire-related fatalities.“My thoughts go out to the families and communities impacted by these tragic deaths,” said Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness. “We all have a role to play in keeping each other safe. This week is Emergency Prepardness Week, and as people remain close to home during COVID-19, it’s an opportunity to test our smoke alarms and practise our home fire escape plans. It could save a life.”“It’s up to each of us to make sure these types of tragedies do not happen,” said Brian Godlonton, Fire Commissioner. “In a typical home fire, you may have as little as one to two minutes to get out safely from the time the smoke alarm sounds. There are simple things that we can do to prevent a fire from happening and be prepared to react if a fire starts.”Here are some tips to help keep yourself, your family and your loved ones safe at home:Reduce fire risks\\nUnattended cooking is a leading cause of home fires. Always stay in the kitchen when cooking.\\nAlways extinguish candles before leaving the room.\\nEncourage smokers to smoke outside the home and outside the garage. Thoroughly extinguish all smoking materials in water or sand.\\nAvoid overloading electrical outlets.\\nMake sure smoke alarms work\\nTest smoke alarms monthly by pressing the test button. Replace batteries according to manufacturer's\\xa0instructions.\\nOnly working smoke alarms can give you the early warning needed to safely escape a fire in your home.\\nMake and practise a home fire escape plan\\nMake your home escape plan.\\nMake sure everyone knows two ways out of each room, if possible.\\xa0\\nAll exits must be unobstructed and easy to use.\\nDetermine who will be responsible for helping young children, older adults and anyone who needs assistance to escape.\\nChoose a meeting place outside, such as a tree or a lamp post, where everyone can be accounted for.\\nCall 911 or a local emergency number from outside the home, from a cellphone or a neighbour’s home.\\nOnce out, stay out.

       "  '\\n\\nAdrian\\xa0Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:\\n“Today\\xa0we are announcing 29 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,315 cases in British Columbia.\\n“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 866 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,089 are in the Fraser Health region, 125 are in the Island Health region (note: two cases were removed from yesterday’s Island Health total due to a data error), 180 are in the Interior Health region and 55 are in the Northern Health region.\\n“We are saddened to report one new COVID-19 related death in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 127 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.\\n“In the last day, there have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 16 facilities and five acute-care units have active cases. Outbreaks have now been declared over at 18 care facilities.\\n“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.\\n“There has been no change in the number of confirmed positive cases at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, United Poultry in Vancouver or at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre.\\n“There are now 61 positive cases at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 17 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.\\n“To date, 1,579 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.\\n\"Of the total COVID-19 cases, 73 individuals are hospitalized and 20 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.\\n“We must continue with what we have been doing, because it is working. We have flattened our curve and must keep it there.\\n“Until we move into Phase 2, the orders, restrictions and guidance remain in place.\\n“Our go-forward principles are our playbook for where we are today and how we will move forward. They are the rules to help us decide what is safe for ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. These principles will not change until COVID-19 is no longer a risk to any of us.\\n“Physical distancing is\\xa0here to stay. We must continue to keep a safe physical distance from anyone outside of our household.\\n“There are no exceptions to staying home if you are ill. Even if it seems to be seasonal allergies, a cold or potentially COVID-19. And if you do have symptoms of COVID-19, contact 811 or your health-care provider to be assessed and tested.\\n“Travelling anywhere increases the likelihood of making us an unintentional carrier for COVID-19. While essential travel must continue, personal travel needs to be minimized, wherever possible.\\n“Our playbook for the pandemic has the ‘rules’ all of us must learn and follow. Keeping these top of mind will allow us to keep progressing through BC’s Restart Plan:\\n\\nMaintain physical distancing outside your household. For example, no handshaking or hugging, keeping your number of contacts low and keeping a safe distance.\\nPractise good hygiene – hand hygiene, avoid touching your face and respiratory etiquette.\\nStay at home and away from others if you are feeling ill. That means staying home from school, work or socializing.\\nMake necessary contact safer with appropriate controls, e.g., using plexiglass barriers or redesigning spaces.\\nIncrease cleaning of\\xa0frequently touched surfaces at home and work.\\nConsider using non-medical masks in situations where physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as on transit or while shopping.\\nContinue to minimize non-essential personal travel.\\nStay informed, be prepared and follow public health advice.\\n\\n“This weekend is Mother’s Day and a time to celebrate and honour someone important to us. We can all do something special for our mothers, whether they are near or far, in your household bubble or not.\\n“For now, avoid any close physical contact, unless your mother is in your immediate household. And if your mother is older, awaiting surgery or has an underlying illness, celebrate at a safe distance. Give your mother the gift of staying safe and healthy.\\n“Let’s continue to stand together in spirit as we stay apart and move forward together.”\\nLearn More:\\nFor more information on BC’s Restart Plan, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/bc-restart-plan\\nFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/conducting-health-research-evaluation/reports-publications\\nFor the slides presented at the May 4 media briefing, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projections\\nFor mental health and anxiety support, visit:\\xa0www.bouncebackbc.ca\\xa0\\nOr:\\xa0www.anxietycanada.com\\nFor guidance and information on self-isolation and self-monitoring, including how to isolate if you live with others, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation\\nFor the provincial health officer\\'s orders, notices and guidance, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidance\\nFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.\\nTo learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing\\nThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here:\\xa0https://bc.thrive.health/\\nTo learn more about Fair PharmaCare, including coverage, how to request an income review and the monthly deductible payment option, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Register_for_Fair_PharmaCare.pdf\\nFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.\\nFor the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nFacebook:\\xa0www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0\\nTwitter:\\xa0https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\xa0\\nYouTube:\\xa0www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC\\nFor a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.08_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdf\\nA backgrounder follows.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nShane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, has issued the following statement regarding tent encampments in Victoria and Vancouver:“This is a challenging time for everyone in British Columbia, especially those facing homelessness. Early in the pandemic it became clear that COVID-19, coupled with the ongoing overdose crisis, has created significant health and safety concerns for our province’s vulnerable people living in encampments, the professionals and volunteers who support these groups and the communities we all share.“On April 25, 2020, the Province took the necessary steps to support people’s transition from unsafe, dense encampments in Oppenheimer Park in Vancouver, and Topaz Park and the Pandora corridor in Victoria, into safer, temporary accommodation as a first step toward more secure housing.“Action needed to be taken for the health, safety and well-being of campers, and the front-line workers who support them. For those who were living in encampments, the wraparound health and other supports our government is providing will drive lasting, positive change for many individuals fighting hardship or addiction. The co-operation between the Province and the cities of Victoria and Vancouver, and the compassionate approach of BC Housing, service providers and the health authorities, has been remarkable.“From the beginning, we committed to a compassionate, supportive approach, putting people’s housing and support needs first, to manage this transition. I’m encouraged our approach has been working. As of May 7, at 4 p.m., over 320 people have moved into safe, temporary accommodations in both Vancouver and Victoria, with wraparound supports to protect their health and safety.“We have worked to ensure\\xa0those who were living in Oppenheimer Park are moving into safe, temporary accommodations with wraparound supports by May 9.“While we have been working with the hotel sector and service delivery partners toward the May 9 target in Victoria, it is now clear that more time is needed to ensure each person leaving Topaz Park and Pandora Avenue is moved into the accommodation that best meets their needs.“To this end, the Province, in consultation with the City of Victoria, has extended the deadline from May 9 to May 20, 2020, to move people from Topaz Park and Pandora Avenue into safe, temporary accommodations. No one will be asked to leave these encampments without being offered a suitable temporary housing option.“The Province is also developing plans for longer term permanent housing solutions for this population, with ongoing supports. These plans will build on the 23,000 homes already underway or complete through our 10-year housing plan and will include strategies to provide the right combination of housing and supports to mitigate the chances of a return to homelessness. That work will continue in the weeks and months ahead, but the priority now is on the immediate health and safety of people experiencing homelessness in these public health emergencies.“Homelessness and affordable housing continue to be concerns throughout British Columbia. People and communities are suffering as a result. Over the last few years, we have taken urgent action to provide supportive housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness throughout the province, opening more than 2,100 new supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness with a further 900 underway around the province, toward a goal of 4,900 over 10 years. This includes 21 units nearing completion in Victoria and 784 complete in Vancouver.“We knew this would be a challenging transition for people, but I am proud of the significant steps we have taken to provide safer and more secure options for people. While this pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge, it is heartening to know that hundreds of people, and the communities they inhabit, will be healthier and safer through this initiative.”Learn More:For daily updates on the number of people being moved from the encampments, visit: https://twitter.com/bc_housing\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

It will also facilitate information sharing and identification of common principles and best practices.“I’m honoured to help facilitate the participation of all of the provinces and territories in the committee’s work, and to share what we learn in British Columbia as we support our chief justices and chief judge to get our courtrooms to a new normal,”\\xa0Eby said. “While it will not be easy, it is urgent that we meet the twin demands of justice and public health. Our response will be better and stronger if we work together, and this committee will assist in the national effort.”The Ministry of Attorney General has established two advisory groups to help the B.C. government support courts and tribunals in delivering services during the pandemic and in mitigating the pandemic’s impacts on the justice system. On April 24, 2020, the Province established the provincial Justice COVID-19 Response Group and the Cross Jurisdictional Technical Advisory Group.

The Province and TransLink will also continue to call on the federal government for a national solution to the challenges facing transit systems.With the release of British Columbia’s Restart Plan, TransLink will review all transit service levels to ensure it is balancing the need to help people get around the region, with the need to maintain and respect enhanced safety protocols. Further service and safety-related announcements will be made in due course.Quotes:Selina Robinson, Minister for Municipal Affairs and Housing\\xa0– \\xa0 \\xa0“As we begin to restore the economy through BC’s Restart Plan, services like TransLink will be key to British Columbia’s transition and recovery success.\\xa0 We remain committed to working with and supporting TransLink through this difficult time and into recovery to find solutions that will benefit Metro Vancouver and British Columbia, and continue to call on the federal government to join us in this support.”Jonathan X. Coté, chair, Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation –“Today’s commitment by the Province of B.C. to help TransLink keep transit service running on Day 1 of the BC Restart Plan is an important first step towards returning TransLink to financial sustainability in the long term. I look forward to working with Minister Robinson and her team through the summer to address the pandemic’s impacts on TransLink finances so that TransLink is equipped to help rebuild our region’s sustainable, innovative economy.”Kevin Desmond, CEO, TransLink –“This is another important step forward for re-starting British Columbia and Metro Vancouver’s economy. The transit service provided by TransLink is essential to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in our region. We will be ready to provide safe, reliable transit service as people return to work. We are proud to be partnering with the Province of B.C. to ensure transit service is there as the economy recovers.”\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe first aerial-spraying treatment to eradicate invasive gypsy moths from 167 hectares of rural land in Raspberry, north of Castlegar, will occur next week, weather permitting.The\\xa0gypsy moth is destructive to native and urban forests and orchards. Without treatment, it could spread to other parts of the province and put at risk hundreds of species of trees and shrubs, including those in endangered Garry oak ecosystems.Spraying will take place north of Broadwater Road, and extend east of Pass Creek road and west of Marshall Road.Spraying will start shortly after sunrise (approximately 5:20 a.m.) and should be completed by 7:30 a.m. daily. Up to four separate treatments are required this spring. Unless delayed by poor weather, each treatment is expected to take one to two mornings to apply. The ministry aims to complete the spraying by mid-June.The spray area will be treated with Foray 48B, which contains Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk). Btk is an organic,\\xa0natural agent that has been approved for the control of gypsy moth larvae in Canada since 1961. Foray 48B and other Btk formulations received certification for acceptable use on certified organic farms by the Organic Materials Review Institute of Canada in April 2018.Btk is naturally present in urban, forest and agricultural soil throughout the province. It does not harm humans, mammals, birds, fish, plants, reptiles, amphibians, bees or other insects and affects caterpillars only after they have ingested it.The spray will be applied by a low-flying plane. Residents within and adjacent to the treatment area will likely hear the aircraft at some point during the treatment. The spray equipment is GPS-calibrated and controlled. Spraying will occur only when the plane is immediately over the treatment area.Anyone wishing to minimize contact with the spray material may choose to remain indoors with their windows and doors closed during the treatment, and for at least 30 minutes after. Pets and livestock that may be frightened by the aircraft should be secured or brought indoors.Poor weather or wind may cause treatments to be postponed with little advance notice, and the treatment will resume the next suitable morning.A telephone line is staffed during business hours, and provides up-to-date spray schedules and recorded information 24 hours per day toll-free, at 1 866 917-5999.

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 33 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 2,288 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 865 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,064 are in the Fraser Health region, 126 are in the Island Health region, 179 are in the Interior Health region and 54 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report two new COVID-19 related deaths, one in the Fraser Health region and one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 126 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“In the last day, there have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 16 facilities and five acute-care units have active cases. Outbreaks have now been declared over at 18 care facilities, including the Swedish Canadian Manor.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.“There are seven confirmed positive cases at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, 56 at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 35\\xa0at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are also 134 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 16 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“To date, 1,512 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 76 individuals are hospitalized, 20 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We are in Phase 1 of our four-part COVID-19 B.C. Restart Plan, which means we must continue doing what we have been doing since the orders and restrictions were put in place a few weeks ago.“Yesterday, the Premier announced we will be ready to move to Phase 2 after the May long weekend. This is something we can all look forward to, but we are not there yet.“Staying home as much as possible and being respectful of those around us when we do go out are still very much a necessity for all of us. These principles will not change, even as we move to the next phase: Safe physical distancing, washing our hands and\\xa0avoiding non-essential personal travel.“It will be a slow and thoughtful restart. As we shift to the next phase, not everyone will be ready to increase their social connection or to restart their business at the same time.“Whether an individual or business, each of us must use the principles we have set out to guide our actions moving forward.“If you are senior, or someone with an underlying illness, your increased risk has not lessened. This means that as you look ahead and consider how you may safely increase your social connections, this needs to be top of mind.“For businesses, public health and WorkSafeBC will outline the specific requirements that must be followed for your business sector and workforce. Template plans and checklists for businesses are being developed for you to follow.“Businesses can make decisions for themselves, based on their ability to meet the requirements that are set out. While individual plans will not need to be submitted for approval, you will need to ensure your plan is publicly posted for everyone to see.“This approach will give your employees and customers the assurance and confidence that you are doing all you can to protect them.“Underpinning the Restart Plan is our COVID-19 health system response.“Today, the surgical renewal plan was announced to significantly increase the number of surgeries and clear the backlog created by COVID-19.\\xa0“The renewal plan will see our health-care\\xa0system maximize every available operating room,\\xa0allowing new capacity, and hiring and training staff to ensure we can provide care for patients while maintaining capacity for a potential surge of COVID-19 patients.“Testing remains in place for anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, public health teams will continue to be on high alert, monitoring and contact tracing new cases of COVID-19.“This renewal plan and our approach moving forward is about ensuring we are operating our health-care system in the safest way possible to protect patients and our health-care workers.“Like everyone around the world, this is a new challenge for all us. Our future is in all of our hands. We must continue to stand together in spirit\\xa0as we get through this pandemic together.”Learn More:For more information on B.C.'s Restart Plan, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/bc-restart-planFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/conducting-health-research-evaluation/reports-publicationsFor the slides presented at the May 4 media briefing, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\xa0\\nOr: www.anxietycanada.comFor guidance and information on self-isolation and self-monitoring, including how to isolate if you live with others, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolationFor the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.To learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/To learn more about Fair PharmaCare, including coverage, how to request an income review, and the monthly deductible payment option, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Register_for_Fair_PharmaCare.pdfFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\xa0\\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCA backgrounder follows.For a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.07_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nSurgeries that were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic are starting back up as part of a massive surgical renewal plan.“British Columbians have stepped up to the challenge of COVID-19 by making sacrifices, including thousands of people who have waited for postponed elective surgeries. This has been very difficult for people and their families,” said Premier John Horgan. “But these sacrifices have helped flatten the curve in B.C., and now we can move forward, safely, getting people the surgeries they’ve been waiting for.”Beginning this month, the Province will launch an extensive surgical renewal plan that will include calling patients, adding new capacity, and hiring and training staff.“On March 16, we made the difficult decision to postpone surgeries to prepare our health-care system for a potential surge of COVID-19 patients,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Our commitment is now to get patients through their surgery safely. It is a massive undertaking, but we are giving the same 100% effort to the task that we’ve made to flattening the curve in B.C.”By May 18, 2020, an estimated 30,000 non-urgent scheduled surgeries will have either been postponed or left on a waitlist due to COVID-19. A\\xa0further 24,000 patients could also be without a referral to a waitlist. This presents a unique and unprecedented challenge never faced by B.C.’s health system. The demands placed by COVID-19 have meant decreased productivity in operating rooms, meaning fewer surgical cases can be completed in the same time.The 30,000 non-urgent elective postponed surgeries, combined with the 24,000 new surgeries are a substantial backlog to address.\\xa0The impact is greater than anything faced by B.C.'s health system.The actions taken under the plan will\\xa0ensure the health system can keep up with demand\\xa0for new surgeries and clear the existing COVID-19 backlog in the next 17 to 24 months.The timeline demonstrates the Province’s ongoing commitment to have British Columbians access much-needed surgeries.Learn More:For recommendations on protecting families and communities from COVID-19, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.B.C.

Data are subject to change:\\nIn March 2020, there were 113 suspected illicit drug toxicity deaths. Exceeding 100 deaths in a month has not occurred since March 2019. These 113 deaths represent a 3% decrease in the number of deaths seen in March 2019. This is a 61% increase over the number of deaths in February 2020.\\nCompared to the January and February 2020 average, the increase in March occurred in every health authority, notably in Fraser (91% increase) and Island health (80% increase). The March 2019 average (117) was also higher than the January and February 2019 average (89).\\nTo date, males accounted for 76% of deaths in 2020,\\xa0 similar to 2019 with 76%, and slightly lower than in 2018 with 80%.\\nIn 2020, 73% of those dying were aged 19 to 49. In 2019 and 2018, 68% were in this age range.\\nBy health authority, Northern Health has the highest rate of illicit drug toxicity deaths, followed by Interior Health in 2020.\\nFrom 2018 to March 2020, the rates of illicit drug toxicity deaths are highest in Hope, Fort Nelson, North Thompson, Lillooet and Arrow Lakes.\\nNo deaths have been reported at supervised consumption or drug overdose prevention sites.\\nLearn More:For the latest report on Illicit Drug Overdose Deaths in B.C.

       "  '\\n\\nJudy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions; Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development; and Rob Fleming, Minister of Education; have released the following statement in recognition of National Child and Youth Mental Health Day:“Every child has the right to mental-health care when and where they need it. And it is our responsibility, as the adults in their lives, to ensure they get it. Today is Child and Youth Mental Health Day – a day for parents, educators, caretakers and the community as a whole to come together to talk about child and youth mental health and to connect with young people about their mental health. The theme for this year is ‘caring’ and the message is simple: ‘I care about you.’“It could not be a more-perfect message for these unprecedented and uncertain times. Up to 84,000 children in British Columbia are experiencing a mental health challenge at any given time. Even before COVID-19, B.C. faced an increased demand for child and youth mental health services. Last year alone, 28,000 children and youth received help. This year, that number is expected to be much higher.“While the pandemic is challenging all of us, it presents unique issues for young people who are missing their friends and social connections, wrestling with new ways of learning and feeling anxious and unsure about what the future holds. Many have seen abrupt endings to things they have worked toward, or anticipated, for years.“But the pandemic has also shown us that people have an incredible ability to come together – to create community and lift each other up in times of crisis. We are reminded that it does, indeed, take a village to raise a child and that raising a child means caring for the whole child – their physical health and their mental health.“We have seen that remarkable caring for children from so many people. Teachers are reaching out to students to see how they are doing while also supporting remote learning. School staff\\xa0are planning creative ways to recognize graduates. Counsellors and support workers are checking in regularly with vulnerable young people. Parents and caregivers are doing everything they can to strengthen caring and social connections because they know that mental well-being is the primary goal right now and well into the future.“And, across government, it is a goal we share to ensure that every young person is able to build a solid foundation for long-term mental health. A year ago, we launched A Pathway to Hope – our roadmap to creating a system of mental health and addictions care that works for everyone. Prevention and early intervention, catching emerging problems before they become larger, was a main focus.“Since announcing the pathway, we have made big strides to provide better mental health care and supports for children, youth and their families. We have increased the number of Foundry locations in the province to nine up and running, and the tenth is on the way. We are building child and youth mental health teams in our school districts. We are expanding the Erase (Expect Respect and Safe Education) program in our schools, and we are working to hire an additional 120 child and youth mental health workers over three years.“Recognizing the mental health challenges brought on or exacerbated by COVID-19, we have also worked with our partners to launch Foundry Virtual Clinic and to expand access to BounceBack and Living Life to the Full programs. To give parents and caregivers practical advice and strategies to help children deal with anxiety, we have adapted the Everyday Anxiety Strategies for Educators (EASE) at Home program, making it available free online for everyone. We have minimized face-to-face contact at our walk-in clinics and are offering supports and resources virtually using Skype and telephone. Mental health clinicians throughout the province continue to be available to help children and families at no cost, should they require additional support or guidance.“These extraordinary times have challenged our children in ways they have not seen in their lifetimes – in ways few people have seen. But where there is challenge, there is also the opportunity to make lasting change and to come back better and stronger. More than ever, young people are talking openly and honestly about their mental health.“As the adults in their lives, we must continue to applaud and encourage these courageous conversations while providing the supports they need. By doing that, we send a very clear message when it comes to the mental health of our children: ‘We care about you.’ Each and every one of you.”Child and Youth Mental Health Resources:Child and Youth Mental Health intake clinics:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/managing-your-health/mental-health-substance-use/child-teen-mental-health/cymh_clinic_list_march_19_2020.pdfMinistry of Education Keep Learning website:\\xa0https://www.openschool.bc.ca/keeplearning/Erase:\\xa0https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/eraseWE Well-being:\\xa0https://www.we.org/en-CA/get-doing/activities-and-resources/wellbeing/SOGI 123:\\xa0https://www.sogieducation.org/all-educators#covid-19-responseEASE at Home:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/managing-your-health/mental-health-substance-use/child-teen-mental-health/easeMinistry of Children and Family Development:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/managing-your-health/mental-health-substance-use/child-teen-mental-healthFamily Smart: https://familysmart.ca/Foundry: https://foundrybc.ca/BounceBack and Living Life to the Full:\\xa0https://cmha.bc.ca/covid-19/Here2Talk:\\xa0https://here2talk.ca/Y-Minds: https://www.gv.ymca.ca/mental-wellness\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nBritish Columbians will move forward with safely restarting their province beginning in mid-May, according to a plan announced by Premier John Horgan.Under BC’s Restart Plan, government will work closely with public health officials, businesses and labour organizations to lift restrictions in phases, gradually allowing for more social and economic activity, while closely monitoring health information to minimize the risk to the public.“Our plan puts safety first. British Columbians have made enormous sacrifices so far, and it’s thanks to them that we’re able to begin to lift some restrictions,” Horgan said. “We’ll allow activities to resume as the evidence and experts tell us it is appropriate to do so. By moving carefully and deliberately, we will help British Columbians get to a ‘new normal,’ where more of our social and economic life can resume.”Restarting economic activity will look different in B.C. than in other jurisdictions, because only a small number of sectors in the province were closed by public health order. Many other provinces are just now reaching the level of safe operations B.C. has been able to maintain throughout the pandemic.B.C. is currently in Phase 1 of the restart plan. Phase 2, which will begin in mid-May, includes:\\nsmall social gatherings;\\na resumption of elective surgeries and regulated health services like physiotherapy, dentistry, chiropractors and in-person counselling;\\nprovincial parks open for day use;\\nopening more non-essential businesses in keeping with safe operations plans;\\nrecalling the provincial legislature for regular sittings.\\nEssential businesses that have remained open during the pandemic, so far, have done so safely with the support of WorkSafeBC. Government will build on this successful experience by supporting all businesses as they take steps toward a successful reopening. Sectors that were ordered closed will be asked to work with WorkSafeBC to develop plans to reopen safely. WorkSafeBC is developing industry-specific guidance to help employers bring workers and customers back safely. Any business restarting operations must ensure it is in compliance with the provincial health officer’s orders and in accordance with occupational health and safety guidance provided by WorkSafeBC.The target date for the start of Phase 3, which will include opening up of additional businesses and services, is between June and September 2020, if transmission rates remain low or in decline.Phase 4 will only be achieved when the threat of COVID-19 has been significantly diminished through widespread vaccination, broad successful treatments, evidence of community immunity, or the equivalent.Most provincial parks will reopen, starting May 14, for day-use only. On June 1, many remaining facilities, including campgrounds, will reopen. A small number of parks that attract large crowds, or where reopening would pose a health risk to nearby communities, will remain closed.A strong emphasis on personal hygiene for all British Columbians, including hand washing, physical distancing and staying at home if you are sick, will be crucial for the success of every phase of the plan.While B.C. already has sufficient testing and tracking capacity, by continuing to increase these, government will be able to identify any flare ups in COVID-19 case numbers and address them. This approach will support public safety and confidence.“Today, we’ve unveiled our plan for a slow and safe restart. We need to be vigilant, to make sure we keep flattening the curve of transmission,” Premier Horgan said. “There is much more to do. But we will get through this pandemic to better days by working together and keeping each other safe.”For a WorkSafeBC backgrounder, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BG_Support_for_Workplaces_Resuming_Operation.pdfFor backgrounders on schools and parks, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BG_Parks_and_Sites_and_In-Class_Learning.pdfLearn More: For more information about BC's Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.06_NR_Premier_Outlines_Plan_to_Restart_BC_Safely-TC.pdfFor a Punjabi translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.06_NR_Premier_Outlines_Plan_to_Restart_BC_Safely-Punjabi.pdfFor a French translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.06_NR_Premier_Outlines_Plan_to_Restart_BC_Safely-FR.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian\\xa0Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today we are announcing 23 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,255 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 852 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,046 are in the Fraser Health region, 124 are in the Island Health region, 179 are in the Interior Health region and 54 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths: one in the Island Health region and two in Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 124 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“In the last day, there were no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 17 facilities and five acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 17 care facilities.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.“There are seven confirmed positive cases at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, 56 at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 35 at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are also 134 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 16 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“To date, 1,494 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 74 individuals are hospitalized, and 19\\xa0of those are in intensive care. The remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We are not yet ready to make any changes to the measures we have in place – just this week, new outbreaks have emerged. Without continued vigilance, hot spots will quickly flare.“We must chart a safe path forward together – one that will protect our province and give us the confidence that we can stay safe while increasing our social connections.“As Premier John Horgan has said, finding the right balance in this next phase of COVID-19 requires all of us to work together, to follow our playbook principles and remember the basics of keeping a safe physical distance from others, with fewer faces and open spaces.“We must also continue to show kindness and compassion to those around us, as we remain 100% committed. It is in all of our hands. Let’s remember to wash them.”Learn More:For the slides presented at the May 4 media briefing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\nOr: www.anxietycanada.comFor guidance and information on self-isolation and self-monitoring, including how to isolate if you live with others, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolationFor the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidance\\n\\nFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.To learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: https://gov.bc.ca/returningtravellersTo learn more about Fair PharmaCare, including coverage, how to request an income review, and the monthly deductible payment option, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Register_for_Fair_PharmaCare.pdfFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.Victims of family and sexual violence can find support from VictimLinkBC at: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/priority-populations/people-who-may-be-or-are-experiencing-violence\\nOr by calling 1 800 563-0808\\xa0For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.06_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

We are acting now to address racism at the community level and ensure all British Columbians are free from discrimination and intimidation.”Following a competitive bidding process, the Province has selected the Victoria Immigrant and Refugee Centre Society (VIRCS) to serve as a provincial hub to help communities address hate activity and\\xa0take on\\xa0systemic and institutionalized racism throughout the province.The provincial government launched Resilience BC, a multi-faceted, provincewide approach in challenging racism at a local level in November 2019.“VIRCS is very proud to lead the important work being done in B.C. communities to stop the spread of racism and end the recent spikes in hate crimes,” said David Lau, executive director, VIRCS. “We look forward to collaborating with community leaders across the province to create innovative local resources to advance multiculturalism, support reconciliation with Indigenous communities and fight prejudice to provide a fully inclusive province for all British Columbians.”Resilience BC will connect communities with a network of information, supports and training to help them respond to incidents of racism and hate. The program is one of many actions the B.C. government is taking as part of its commitment to stand up for diversity, end racism and all forms of discrimination, and support multiculturalism in British Columbia.The Province has begun a competitive bidding process to establish community-based Resilience BC spokes to work with the provincial hub to address racism and hate at local and regional levels. Community organizations interested in leading anti-racism and anti-hate efforts in their communities are encouraged to submit proposals by May 19, 2020. \\xa0Quick Facts:\\nThe development of Resilience BC was informed by input gathered during a community consultation led by Ravi Kahlon, former parliamentary secretary for sport and multiculturalism, in 2019.\\nVIRCS is a non-profit organization founded in November 1989 by three former refugees and is regarded as a leader in anti-racism work in Greater Victoria.\\nAs the appointed hub service provider for Resilience BC, VIRCS has been awarded\\xa0$240,000 for activities in the fiscal year 2020-21.\\nThe total investment in Resilience BC is $540,000 annually.

In Victoria, we have seen encampments at Topaz Park and the Pandora corridor grow into unsafe, dense encampments that are compounding existing health, well-being and safety challenges,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “The centre offers a temporary and secure place with wraparound support services to help people stay safe during this time.”The temporary emergency response centre is scheduled to open in the coming days, once all staff are in place. GSL Group, the developer and operator of the facility, is extending the use of the arena to BC Housing to provide shelter to vulnerable people in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.“From the beginning of the crisis, we\\'ve said we could make our arenas throughout B.C. available for medical purposes, if needed,\" said Graham Lee, president and CEO of GSL Group. “We are pleased to support the Province\\'s effort\\xa0to provide an emergency response centre and the ongoing efforts from the Province and the City of Victoria to support those in need.”BC Housing is partnering with PHS Community Services Society to operate the emergency response centre, which will receive people referred by Island Health and BC Housing. The centre will accommodate couples and groups of people who wish to stay together, where possible.BC Housing is partnering with Staples Business Advantage to provide pop-up pods that are being rapidly installed in the arena to provide privacy. The advantage of this pop-up solution is the speed at which the pods can be assembled.\\xa0The Province has plans to expand their use at other emergency response centres.In addition to a space of their own, people will have access to services\\xa0such as meals, washroom facilities, health-care services, addictions treatment and harm reduction, storage for personal belongings and other supports.“We are grateful to GSL for working with BC Housing and the Province to make this facility available to help those in Victoria in need of temporary sheltering, meals or specialized health services,\" said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. \"Moving into the arena in the short term is a step closer for people to have safe, secure long-term housing.”BC Housing has also partnered with the Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness to open 12 temporary shelter spaces at a different location to provide culturally supportive services to Indigenous peoples who are experiencing homelessness in the community.From April 25 to May 4, 2020, 92\\xa0people from encampments on Pandora Avenue and in Topaz Park have moved into safe, temporary accommodations with wraparound supports to protect their health and safety in the overlapping COVID-19 and overdose crises.Learn More:For an overview of BC Housing’s work to monitor and respond to COVID-19, visit:\\xa0https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For more information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), sevendays a week.To see photos of the pop-up pods in Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre, visit: https://www.flickr.com/photos/bcgovphotos/49859489731/And here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/bcgovphotos/49859799647/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nWith annual flood and wildfire seasons approaching in British Columbia and physical distancing restrictions in place due to COVID-19, the Province is launching a digital registration system for Emergency Support Services (ESS).The new platform will be available for communities to provide evacuee self-registration, digital registration and referrals, and basic reporting.“Following the 2017 wildfire season, our government began working to modernize the delivery of ESS,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “Moving from an archaic paper-based system to a digital platform will ensure safe and timely access to services for those who need help during some of their hardest moments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual delivery of ESS is more important than ever to ensure safe physical distancing for volunteers and evacuees.”Modernizing the registration system ensures evacuees have quick access to the supports they need, such as lodging, food and clothing. On average, approximately 30,000 people use ESS each year. The digital registration system will allow volunteers to concentrate on the needs of the most vulnerable people during an evacuation, while enabling safe physical distancing measures to protect both volunteers and evacuees.“The new virtual registration system for emergency supports allows us to keep all our ESS volunteers,” said David Trawin, chief administrative officer, City of Kamloops. “The majority of these volunteers are seniors, and more than half said they would not be available if registration was paper-based and face-to-face interaction was required. It would have crippled us if we needed evacuations for floods and fire.”The digital system was successfully piloted in four communities during the spring and summer of 2019: Prince George, Kamloops, Tk’emlups te Secwepemc and the Regional District of Central Okanagan. As communities work to implement and train on the new system, the Province will continue to work with communities to ensure it runs smoothly. Continued improvements will be made throughout the next year, so it will be able to support direct payment to evacuees and suppliers.Learn More:For information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, including for employers, businesses and schools, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe official BC Wildfire Service mobile app is now available, providing real-time wildfire information and an interactive map that users can customize to display a variety of fire-related data.The new app is one of many proactive initiatives undertaken by the BC Wildfire Service to give members of the public, media and stakeholders access to consistent, accurate and timely wildfire information throughout the province. This app complements the BC Wildfire Service’s website and social media channels.Key features of the mobile app include:1. Wildfire mapThe app’s landing page is an interactive wildfire map that offers the same features available through the B.C. Wildfire Dashboard: www.bcwildfire.ca\\ncurrent fire danger ratings\\nactive fires\\nfires that have been declared “out”\\nopen burning prohibitions (including campfire bans)\\nevacuation alerts and evacuation orders\\narea restrictions\\ncurrent wildfire statistics\\nperimeters of wildfires for the current season (April 1 through March 31 of the following year)\\nboundaries of B.C.’s six regional fire centres\\nBC Parks closures and recreation site closures\\nwildfire search tool (search by active fire name, fire number or location)\\nDrive BC events (e.g., advisories and closures)\\nThe app also offers a “Near Me” function. When users select the “Near Me” option, the app will only display information within a 50-kilometre radius of their current location, allowing them to more easily focus on wildfire activity within that area.2. Latest news and advisoriesThe BC Wildfire Service mobile app allows users to view the latest informational tweets directly from the BC Wildfire Service’s Twitter feed. A personal Twitter account is not required to view this feed. The latest advisories (related to open burning bans and prohibitions, area restrictions, evacuation alerts and evacuation orders) are also available on the app.3. StatisticsWildfire statistics for the current wildfire season (April 1 through March 31 of the following year) are available through the app:\\na rolling total of all active wildfires\\na rolling total of all wildfires (active and extinguished)\\nthe number of wildfires detected in the last two days\\nthe number of wildfires detected in the last seven days\\nAll of these statistics can be filtered by fire centre, suspected cause, stage of control, current year fires or active fires.4. Fire reporting toolThe BC Wildfire Service relies on the public to report wildfires and irresponsible behaviour that could start a wildfire. The app features a “Report a Fire” function that will automatically generate map co-ordinates of your current location. Provincial Wildfire Reporting Centre staff will ask for these co-ordinates when the user reports a wildfire. This feature also indicates what sort of questions a person may be asked when reporting a wildfire.Available for download nowThe BC Wildfire Service mobile app is available for Apple (iOS) and Android devices and is free to download in the App Store and Google Play.\\nAndroid: The BC Wildfire Service mobile app can be downloaded at Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.bc.gov.WildfireInformation\\nApple (iOS): The BC Wildfire Service mobile app can be downloaded from the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bc-wildfire-service/id1477675008?ls=1\\nLearn More:For further details about the BC Wildfire Service mobile app, refer to the online reference guide: http://ow.ly/dZkr30qDdfMTo learn about current wildfire activity, open burning prohibitions, evacuation alerts, evacuation orders and more, check out the app or go to the B.C.

       "  '\\n\\nThe first aerial-spraying treatment to eradicate invasive gypsy moths from 231 hectares of residential and municipal park land in Lake Cowichan will occur next week, weather permitting.The gypsy moth is destructive to native and urban forests and orchards. Without treatment, it could spread to other parts of the province and put\\xa0hundreds of species of trees and shrubs at risk, including endangered Garry oak ecosystems.Spraying will take place from the forest south of Hammond Road, north to the Cowichan Valley Highway, west to Fen Road and east to Boundary Road.Spraying will start shortly after sunrise (approximately 5:50 a.m.) and should be completed by 7:30 a.m. daily. Up to four separate treatments are required this spring. Unless delayed by poor weather, each treatment is expected to take one to two mornings to apply. The first treatment will take two mornings.\\xa0The ministry aims to complete spraying by mid-June.The spray area will be treated with Foray 48B, which contains Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk). Btk is an organic, natural agent that has been approved for the control of gypsy moth larvae in Canada since 1961. Foray 48B and other Btk formulations received certification for acceptable use on certified organic farms by the Organic Materials Review Institute of Canada in April 2018.Btk is naturally present in urban, forest and agricultural soil throughout the province. It does not harm humans, mammals, birds, fish, plants, reptiles, amphibians, bees or other insects and affects caterpillars only after they have ingested it.The spray will be applied by a low-flying plane. Residents within and adjacent to the treatment area will likely hear the aircraft at some point during the treatment. The spray equipment is GPS-calibrated and controlled. Spraying will occur only when the plane is immediately over the treatment area.Anyone wishing to minimize contact with the spray material may choose to remain indoors with their windows and doors closed during the treatment, and for at least 30 minutes after. Pets or livestock that may be frightened by the aircraft should be secured or brought indoors.Poor weather or wind may cause treatments to be postponed with little advance notice, and the treatment will resume the next suitable morning.A telephone line is staffed during business hours\\xa0and\\xa0provides up-to-date spray schedules and recorded information 24 hours per day, toll-free, at 1 866 917-5999.

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: May 2 to May 3, and May 3 through to midday today.“In the first reporting period through May 3, we had 34 new cases, for a total of 2,205 cases in British Columbia.“In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 19 new cases, for a total of 2,224 cases in British Columbia.“This represents 53 new cases since we reported on Saturday.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 845 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,027 are in the Fraser Health region, 124 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 177 are in the Interior Health region and 51 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths, two in the Fraser Health region and one in Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 117 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“In the last day, there have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 19 facilities and\\xa0three acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 14 care facilities.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.“There are seven confirmed positive cases at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, 54 at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 35 employees confirmed positive at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are also 134 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 15 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“To date, 1,417 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 77 individuals are hospitalized, and 20 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“As we look at the epidemiology of COVID-19 over the past four months, we can see how the virus has affected people in British Columbia. What we know is that every region of the province has been impacted. We also know that severe illness is most prevalent with our seniors and Elders, men over 50 and those with chronic underlying health conditions.“Our health system transformed in a matter of weeks to prepare and respond to COVID-19 and remains ready for all critical care patients, including those with COVID-19. At the same time, we have increased our provincial critical care and portable ventilators to sustain an enhanced level of readiness.“Our dynamic modelling shows us that we have been able to put the brakes on COVID-19, but we haven't stopped the car. It also highlights that we must maintain safe physical distancing to keep our curve flat.“The toll of COVID-19 has been felt\\xa0by all of us. This week, as Canadian Mental Health Week, is a reminder that we must also continue be vigilant about our mental health.“Many are concerned that we are not moving quickly enough to reopen our province, and just as many are fearful that moving too quickly will set us back to untenable levels. It is a careful balance and one that we are working hard to achieve. And, it will require every one of us to fully participate to make our ‘new normal’ a success.“Until we have a vaccine available for everybody, COVID-19 is going to be in B.C. This means our ‘new normal’ must continue to protect our health and well-being, protect our health-care system, create opportunities for increased social interaction and allow for the rebuilding of our economy with the cautious easing of restrictions.“Our ‘new normal’\\xa0is based on\\xa0principles that apply to every person and every situation. These principles are the foundation of how we need to move forward with our B.C. plan and will remain in place in the weeks and months ahead.“These principles include:\\nstaying informed, being prepared and following public health advice;\\npractising good hygiene – hand hygiene, avoid touching your face and\\xa0respiratory etiquette;\\nstaying at home and away from others if you are feeling ill – not ever going to school or work;\\nmaintaining physical distancing outside the household, e.g., no handshakes or hugs, and keeping your number of contacts low and keeping a safe distance;\\nmaking necessary contacts safer with appropriate controls, e.g., using plexiglass barriers or redesigning spaces;\\nincreasing cleaning of\\xa0frequently touched surfaces at home and work;\\nconsidering the use of non-medical masks in situations where physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as on transit or while shopping; and\\ncontinuing to reduce personal non-essential travel.\\xa0\\n“As you think about your personal go-forward plan, think of your connections as the rings on a tree. One additional connection or ring makes for a much bigger risk of exposure and transmission.“Adding just one person into your circle adds all of the people from their circle – from their home, their work or others\\xa0they have close contact with. If you or someone in your household is high risk, the less interaction you have with others, the better you can protect them.\\xa0“We are nearing the end of our beginning. We have learned, we have prepared and we have done our best to break the chain of transmission. We are now entering a new phase where we must be equally vigilant and equally committed to protecting our loved ones, our seniors and Elders, our health-care workers and our communities.“It is in our hands, as long as we do not forget to wash them, to make this summer the B.C. summer of renewal.”Learn More:The latest modelling presentation and information is available online: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor guidance and information on self-isolation and self-monitoring, including how to isolate if you live with others, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolationFor the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.To learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: https://gov.bc.ca/returningtravellersTo learn more about Fair PharmaCare, including coverage, how to request an income review and the Monthly Deductible Payment Option, visit:\\nhttps://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Register_for_Fair_PharmaCare-Handout.pdfFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\xa0\\nOr: www.anxietycanada.comFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.Victims of family and sexual violence can find support from VictimLinkBC online:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/priority-populations/people-who-may-be-or-are-experiencing-violence\\xa0\\nOr by calling 1 800 563-0808Victims of family and sexual violence can find support from Women's Support Services online: https://www.bwss.org/\\nOr by calling 1 855 687-1868 or texting 604 652-1867For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\xa0\\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.04_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has changed almost every aspect of our lives.Many of us are living with isolation and loneliness, financial worries, the challenges of home-schooling our kids and working from home, and the fear of becoming sick with COVID-19. We’re experiencing increased anxiety, stress and depression – and sometimes grief and loss. And many of the things that traditionally bring us joy have been put on hold.Simply asking, “How are you doing?” has taken on a much deeper meaning than it did before phrases like “self-isolation” and “physical distancing” came into our lives. We care about one another and are looking out for each other in thoughtful and compassionate ways. Many of us are talking about our individual and collective mental health like never before.Each year, one in five Canadians will experience a mental health challenge. But in the last few months, that number is much, much higher. A recent Angus Reid survey indicates that half of Canadians say their mental health has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic and 16% describe themselves as depressed.May 4 to 10, 2020, marks Mental Health Week in Canada – a week to celebrate, protect and promote mental health. The theme this year is “social connection,” and it couldn’t be more timely.This year, during Mental Health Week and beyond, Canadians are being asked to get real about mental health – to tell others how they are really feeling and to reach out for help and connection when they need it. If we take the time to hear what people are really saying when they reply with a simple “fine” or “okay,” we will connect in ways that make a real difference to the well-being of someone who is struggling.Long before COVID-19 and physical distancing, our government recognized how important it is to expand and strengthen mental health supports in British Columbia. That’s why we launched A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap to creating a system of mental health and addictions care that works for everyone. We’ve made big strides when it comes to mental health, including increasing access to low- or no-cost community counselling, expanding the network of Foundry youth centres throughout B.C. and getting started on building child and youth mental health teams in our school districts.As we face this pandemic, we also know that people who experience social isolation are at increased risk of experiencing stress, anxiety and depression. That’s why we moved quickly to provide $5 million for virtual mental health supports for people around the province, with a focus on our heroic front-line health care workers, unsettled young people and their families, and isolated seniors who are seeking connection and help with day-to-day activities.These initiatives include BounceBack – a free program for people experiencing low mood, depression or anxiety, Foundry Virtual Clinic for youths aged\\xa012 to 24 and their families, low- and no-cost community counselling available in many languages, and the mobile response team supporting health-care workers on the front lines of two public health emergencies: COVID-19 and the continuing overdose crisis.These unprecedented times are challenging our mental health. But where there is uncertainty and instability, there is also an opportunity to make lasting change, and to come back better and stronger.More than ever, people are talking openly and honestly about their mental health – sharing their stories, acknowledging their challenges and reaching out for help. And by talking about our mental health, we are creating the vital connections that will help us through this pandemic and beyond. I encourage everyone to do their part and get real about mental health – because the only way to get through this is together.And remember, when someone asks you how you are, it’s okay to say, “I’m not okay.”Learn More:Government of British Columbia mental health supports: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19Canadian Mental Health Association: https://cmha.bc.ca/covid-19/\\xa0Foundry: https://foundrybc.ca/For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nTo ease financial hardship on businesses and to keep employees connected with their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, government has extended the temporary layoff period to 16 weeks for COVID-19 related reasons.Previously under the Employment Standards Act, a temporary layoff longer than 13 weeks in any 20-week period (or about three months in a five-month period) was considered a permanent layoff. With a permanent layoff, employers are required to provide employees with written working notice of termination and/or pay severance to qualifying employees, based on their length of service. Now, temporary layoffs relating to the COVID-19 pandemic can be extended to 16 weeks, if the employee agrees.This change to the Employment Standards Act aligns B.C.’s temporary layoff provisions with the federal Canada Emergency Response Benefit period. The federal period provides 16 weeks of financial support, allowing employees to take full advantage of those benefits.It also allows employees to keep their job, even if they are not working, for 16 weeks of temporary layoff. Employers will be able to quickly resume operations should the public health emergency end within that time.The COVID-19 emergency temporary layoff provisions are not intended to be permanent and will be repealed when no longer needed.\\xa0\\xa0Learn More:For information on employment standards around temporary layoffs, visit: www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/termination#laying-offFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: www.bccdc.ca\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on TwitterFor the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For a Chinese\\xa0translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.04_IB_Layoff_Provisions-TC.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.04_IB_Layoff_Provisions-Punjabi.pdf\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nFollowing an investigation, the BC Wildfire Service has determined the cause of the 2017 Elephant Hill wildfire.This wildfire started on July 6, 2017, about 2.5 kilometres southwest of Ashcroft. It eventually burned 191,865 hectares in B.C.’s south-central Interior region, including parts of both the Kamloops Fire Centre and Cariboo Fire Centre.The BC Wildfire Service’s fire origin and cause specialists investigated the Elephant Hill wildfire, and their report indicated that the most likely cause of the Elephant Hill wildfire was smoking or smoking materials. The “smoking materials” classification includes matches, cigars, pipe tobacco, cigarettes and/or marijuana.Other potential causes of the fire were eliminated as part of the investigation, including:\\nlightning;\\nescaped campfire;\\nCategory 2, Category 3 or Resource Management Open Fire activity;\\narson/suspicious; juvenile fire setter/fire use; equipment use;\\nrailroads;\\nvehicles; and\\nelectrical transmission/utility line/pole.\\nThe BC Wildfire Service’s fire origin and cause report was completed in fall 2017 and submitted as part of a larger RCMP investigation into the Elephant Hill wildfire. The RCMP recently concluded its investigation, so the BC Wildfire Service can now share its information regarding the cause of this wildfire.The BC Wildfire Service and RCMP investigations did not uncover sufficient evidence to identify the person whose actions started the Elephant Hill wildfire. Therefore, it was not possible to lay charges or pursue cost recovery for damages caused by this fire. The BC Wildfire Service’s investigation into the Elephant Hill wildfire is now complete and no further action will be taken at this time.To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.Follow the latest B.C. wildfire news:\\non Twitter: http://twitter.com/BCGovFireInfo\\non Facebook: http://facebook.com/BCForestFireInfo\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nMusic Monday will be very different this year for students and teachers, but for Karen Withers’ class, their Monday lesson will start the way it always does - whether in school or virtually - with a joke:What kind of soap did the composer use? Anti-BACH-terial soap!It is one of the ways Withers, a music teacher at Nanaimo’s Ecole Pauline Haarer elementary, is helping her students continue to feel a sense of routine and normalcy while in-class learning is suspended and school lessons happen remotely.“Bringing music to students and creating lifelong lovers of music has always been a passion of mine,” said Withers. “In this unusual situation we find ourselves, I really wanted to be a source of connection and comfort for my students, the majority of whom I have taught for many years. At this same time, I wanted to create some normalcy in the school lives by continuing with programs we do on a regular basis.”Music Monday, celebrated this year on May 4, is one of the world’s largest single events dedicated to raising awareness about music education. Normally, this event is a series of live concert performances at venues across the country. This year, however, it is moving online to help people maintain physical distancing during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Students from over 100 B.C. schools are joining hundreds of thousands of people from across Canada #TogetherInHarmony to celebrate. The event will be livestreamed for 12 hours on YouTube and on Facebook.“Music is an integral part of any student’s education, and I’m heartened to see it continuing as much as possible,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Teachers, students and parents are using creative and innovative ways of bringing music from their classrooms into homes. What a great way to celebrate Music Monday during an unprecedented time.”At Vancouver’s Van Horne Elementary, music teacher Bev Williams is asking her students to celebrate Music Monday by making musical connections.“Whether it’s going on FaceTime to sing for a grandparent, sharing a piece of music with a family member, interviewing a relative and finding out what music means to them or a little bit about their family’s musical heritage and traditions, or creating a joint playlist with their friends and listening to the same music, I want them to feel the power of music to bring people together,” said Williams.The positive connection between music teachers and their students\\xa0is being noted and appreciated by parents.Yukari Peerless, whose son is in Grade 6 and plays cello at Victoria’s Lansdowne Middle School, was put at ease when her son’s music teacher gave her son a little more time to breathe. Rather than having to meet a regular practice schedule at home, he now sends a video assignment and participates in optional Zoom sessions. Peerless said that small gesture went a long way in her household, reducing stress in what is a challenging time.“When the music teacher’s email came in and said, \\'This is a time to have fun,’ I got a little choked up – and that was at the end of March,” said Peerless. “I think my son also felt the same way, I could tell when I saw his face sort of light up. It was so important to us.”In North Vancouver, Argyle Secondary band director Diana Chan tasked her students to explore different ways to make music away from school. She then put together a video highlighting how some of her students have used this time to practise, improvise, record and produce their own music: https://youtu.be/hagmWeyNoSI“I am very lucky to be part of such a talented and creative community,” said Chan. \"There was no shortage of cool projects that students shared with me.”These are some of the many ways teachers and students are responding to new and creative ways to learn music in B.C. schools, on Music Monday and beyond.“Now more than ever, Canadians understand the vital role that music plays within our culture,” said Eric Favaro, chair of the Coalition for Music Education. “Music Monday brings us together to demonstrate our immense love for music and the important role it plays in the shaping of young lives.”Learn more: For more information about Music Monday, and to watch online, visit: https://coalitioncanada.ca/musicmonday/en/Watch livestreaming content from B.C. artists at: https://showcasebc.ca\\nOr follow #ShowcaseBC on Twitter.For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer\\'s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\n\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAnne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism, has issued the following statement in honour of Asian Heritage Month in British Columbia:\"May is Asian Heritage Month, a time dedicated to honour and recognize the many contributions of people of Asian ethnicity to B.C.’s rich cultural society. \\xa0“Throughout our history, there have been many inspirational individuals of Asian heritage whose accomplishments have played a vital role in B.C.’s social and economic success. This includes: David Lam, the 25th lieutenant governor of British Columbia; Asa Johal, a Sikh immigrant who founded Terminal Forest Products, B.C.’s largest independent lumber company; and Masumi Mitsui, a Canadian soldier decorated with the Military Medal for bravery during the Battle at Vimy Ridge. Following his return to B.C., Mitsui helped establish the Japanese Canadian war memorial in Stanley Park.“As someone of Chinese heritage who immigrated from Asia myself, I know the courage it takes for people to uproot their lives in search of new opportunity and a better life, and I have a deep respect for the many people who have made a similar journey. As Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism, I am proud of the many government supports and services available for newcomers.“Asian Heritage month is also a reminder that our multicultural society makes this province such an amazing place to live. I have seen the rise of anti-Asian racism and hate crimes in our province due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Any act of racism is unacceptable and everyone deserves to feel safe. In this time of global crisis, we must remember that our communities are richer because of the contributions of all British Columbians. More than ever, we need to stand together, show kindness and demonstrate through our words and actions that hate has no place in B.C.“In honour of B.C.’s cultural diversity and in recognition of the contributions of people of all backgrounds, I encourage everyone to take this opportunity to learn more about the culture, traditions and history of Asian British Columbians. Increasing our understanding of B.C.’s multicultural heritage fosters intercultural connections and lays the foundation for a more welcoming and inclusive B.C., creating a better future for everyone.”Translations:For a Punjabi translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Punjabi.pdfFor a traditional Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-TC.pdfFor an Arabic translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Arabic.pdfFor a Farsi translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Farsi.pdfFor a Japanese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Japanese.pdfFor a Korean translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Korean.pdfFor a Tagalog translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Tagalog.pdfFor a Vietnamese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Vietnamese.pdfFor an Indonesian translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_Statement_Asian_Heritage_Month_INDONESIAN.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.\"In the last day, there have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 21 facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 12 care facilities.\"Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be direcly affected and their close contacts.“There is a new outbreak at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, with three confirmed cases to date. Fraser health is on site and investigating.\"There are 52 employees confirmed positive at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 35\\xa0employees confirmed positive at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are now 133\\xa0inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 15 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“To date, 1,376 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 72 individuals are currently hospitalized, 23 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“The outbreak at the Kearl\\xa0Lake plant\\xa0in Alberta continues to impact us here in B.C. It is vitally important that anyone who has been at the site since March 24 follows the B.C. requirements when at home.“This includes self-isolating on your return, your entire family being diligent about physical distancing, monitoring yourself and your family closely for symptoms and contacting heath-care providers or 811 for testing, as necessary.“All of us must be extremely cautious to protect our loved ones and our communities when we are connected to any outbreak. It is far too easy to tip the scales against us and undo the hard work and sacrifice that we have made to flatten the curve, especially as we look to ease restrictions.“We are all feeling the fatigue of maintaining safe physical distance – of not seeing friends and needing to make social connections in other ways.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Province is continuing to support local governments by allowing them to hold public hearings electronically during the current provincial state of emergency.“Local governments will be a key partner in our recovery effort,” said Selina Robinson, Minister Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Construction and development activities are expected to be a key part of B.C.’s recovery efforts – and building housing, in particular, affordable housing, will contribute to our goal to provide affordable housing for all British Columbians. Amending this order will allow local governments to continue their work on land-use decision-making and keep building their communities for the people they serve.”Under the Emergency Program Act, the Province has repealed and replaced Ministerial Order M083 with M139 to expand the authorities given to local governments under M083. The new order will help local governments, improvement districts and the Islands Trust continue to make important decisions for their communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, including allowing local governments to hold public hearings electronically.As public input is an essential part of land-use decision-making, even for those decisions that do not require a public hearing, local governments are still expected to find ways to encourage public participation.Local governments are required to hold public hearings for some development applications before making a decision. A significant delay in processing development applications could result in cost increases or cancelled projects,\\xa0and could negatively impact the province’s economic recovery.Local governments are still expected to find ways to encourage public participation during this time and continue to be as transparent as possible by keeping the public informed on any decisions and procedural changes through their websites and social media.Each local government will need to determine what electronic method works best for it. At the time of public notice, the local government will be expected to provide information on how people can participate in the hearing. Options local governments may consider include calling in and video conferencing. Local governments will also continue to be required to accept written submissions for public hearings, whether in-person or electronic.The\\xa0new order gives the Islands Trust the authority to hold meetings electronically without in-person public participation, allows for bylaws to be read and adopted in a single day and allows the use of electronic options for its public hearings.In addition, the order authorizes improvement districts to hold trustee board meetings electronically to make financial decisions for their community and allows them to postpone their annual general meetings and elections until COVID-19 is no longer a public health threat.Learn More: Provincial guidance for local governments during COVID-19:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/local-governments/governance-powers/covid-19COVID-19 provincial support and information:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support?utm_campaign=20200319_GCPE_AM_COVID_6_NOTIFICATION_BCGOVNEWS_BCGOV_EN_BC__NOTIFICATION\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nGovernment has temporarily deferred renewal fees for those liquor licensees experiencing financial hardship due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.In response to the significant challenges that some in the liquor industry are facing due to COVID-19, the general manager of the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch has authorized the temporary extension for liquor licences expiring between March 31 and June 30, 2020, to ease the financial burden of upcoming renewal fees. As government focuses on those businesses that have been most affected by the provincial health officer’s orders, this extension will be applicable to most liquor licences, with the exceptions of licensee retail stores, special wine stores and wine stores with wine on shelf in grocery stores.This temporary extension to current licences is not a licence renewal. Extended licences must still be renewed prior to their new expiry dates. Renewal fees will be deferred until Sept. 30, 2020, and will continue to be calculated in accordance with Schedule 1 of the Liquor Control and Licensing Regulation (LCLR) and, if applicable, s.204 of the LCLR.\\xa0Eligible licensees whose licences fall within the time period noted above, and who find themselves in financial need, may ask for support by emailing a request to: LCRB_COVID19@gov.bc.caLicensees who can renew their licence and pay the associated renewal fees in accordance with their current expiry date are encouraged to do so, so those most directly impacted can benefit.As this is an evolving situation, government will review this temporary provision as the public health crisis progresses.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on TwitterFor provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

This section of Highway 1 is being expanded, making it safer for travellers, including commercial truck drivers.\"It’s important we keep moving forward on major projects that will spur economic recovery and help build out of this pandemic,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “This project, delivered under our Community Benefits Agreement, will ensure that local workers are employed and that communities will benefit during the COVID-19 pandemic.”Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place that follow the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These include reducing in-person meetings and gatherings, holding meetings outdoors and ensuring physical distancing of workers throughout the work day. These measures, along with other work protocols such as daily cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and surfaces, will help ensure worker and public safety.“Our government’s priority is keeping workplaces safe as we continue to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Trevena said. “We’re ensuring crews will be working in a safe environment as we deliver this project that will keep people and goods moving safely and efficiently.”Along with widening 3.3 kilometres of Highway 1 to four lanes with a central median barrier, work on this project also includes:\\nat-grade protected T-intersection at both Chase Creek Road\\xa0and Shuswap Avenue;\\na grade separated pedestrian crossing and multi-use pathway to link the Neskonlith Indian Band and the Village of Chase communities;\\na cattle underpass to comply with Agricultural Land Commission requirements; and\\nconversion of the existing highway to frontage road to consolidate access.\\nOnce the contract is awarded through an open bidding process, work is expected to begin late this summer.The project is being delivered under the Province’s Community Benefits Agreement, which prioritizes hiring local workers, Indigenous peoples, women, people with disabilities and other under-represented groups to do the work in a safe, welcoming work environment. This project will help diversify and grow B.C.’s skilled workforce and support well-paying careers in local communities.\\xa0 \\xa0Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: \\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.For guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNTHighway 1 four-laning program: http://www.bchwy1.ca/Job opportunities for the Chase four-laning project: https://www.bcib.ca/A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe Government of British Columbia has proclaimed May as Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month, and asks all drivers to pay special attention when sharing the road with motorcyclists.As the weather turns warmer and drier, motorcycle riders are tuning engines, shining chrome and heading out on scenic rides.It is important for all drivers to be aware of more motorcyclists on the road and to watch carefully, especially at night or in bad weather conditions.To safely share the road with motorcyclists, drivers are asked to allow at least three to four seconds of following distance when behind a motorcycle and give plenty of lane space when passing. Motorcycles are often closer than they seem. Since it can be difficult to tell how fast they are moving, be prepared to yield.The majority of crashes involving motorcycles happen at intersections. Drivers should scan intersections carefully, especially when turning left. Riders should adjust their lane position and reduce speed when approaching an intersection, so there is time to stop if needed.Motorcyclists can take steps to better protect themselves. Motorcycle riders and their passengers should wear “all the gear, all the time” in all weather conditions. This includes a helmet with a full-face visor, leather or heavy fabric jacket and heavy, over-the-ankle boots. Wearing proper motorcycle safety gear is key to preventing severe injuries if a crash occurs.Spring weather can mean more wildlife wandering on or near highways and roads. All drivers and riders are reminded to watch carefully for wildlife, especially when animals are most active from dusk to dawn.Loud\\xa0motorcycle exhausts can be disruptive to others, in both urban and rural areas. The Province asks all motorcyclists to enjoy their rides, while respecting regulations around excessive exhaust noise.Road safety is everyone’s responsibility. Whether driving a motorcycle, a passenger vehicle or commercial truck, or walking or riding a bike, people are asked to respect the rules of the road and consider the safety of other road users.Learn More: Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month proclamation: http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/OIC_CUR/MotorcycleSafetyAwarenessMonth2020Visit ICBC’s “all the gear, all the time” page: https://www.icbc.com/road-safety/sharing/motorcycle-safety/Pages/motorcycle-safety-gear.aspx\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe B.C. government is deferring one of the fees it charges to help people, communities and forest companies navigate through the COVID-19 crisis.Stumpage, the fee operators pay the Province to harvest, buy or sell trees from Crown land, is being deferred for three months.“As government, we had already taken a number of steps to help forest communities and the industry because they were facing tough times even before the COVID-19 crisis came along,” said Premier John Horgan. “Now, we’re deferring stumpage fees so companies can maintain their financial liquidity, which will not only benefit them, but ideally, forest workers and communities as well.”The deferral with interest is available to Tree Farm Licence, Replaceable Forest Licence and First Nations’ Woodlands Licence holders who are in good financial standing with the Province. They also must be following through on their reforesting obligations.The deferral will leave eligible companies with an estimated $80 million so they can pay employees, pay contractors and pay other bills needed to keep their doors open or reopen them faster.“We’re building on other measures we’ve taken to help the forest sector navigate this crisis,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “What we’re announcing today may allow some companies to get back online sooner rather than later when we get through the situation we’re in now – or it may save other companies from having to shut down altogether.”Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, said: “COVID-19 just added to the challenges facing our forest sector. In conversations with the forestry industry, the deferral of stumpage was a key ask, and I am pleased our government has been able to deliver support to companies, contractors and workers.”Kahlon added that the $69 million fund announced last fall to support British Columbia forest workers affected by mill closures and shift reductions in several B.C. Interior communities included new supports to make sure people have access to the services they need. This includes everything from training, to work placement, to early retirement. It also includes community support grants for communities that have been hardest hit by a mill closure or curtailment.On March 26, 2020, government announced a list of health and non-health services that are essential, as part of its ongoing response to COVID-19. These include businesses that ensure global continuity of supply of primary and value-added forestry/silviculture products (e.g. lumber, pulp, paper, wood fuel, etc.), including soft-pulp products, such as protective masks, gowns, drapes, screens and other hospital supplies, as well as household paper products.Government also acted quickly to deliver relief and support in response to COVID-19, including a $1,000 boost to anyone approved for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\\xa0It’s also why legislation was tabled that will mean no one can be fired for taking time off work to follow the advice of the provincial health officer.As well, major industries like pulp and paper mills and mines, will have the opportunity to defer 50% of their BC Hydro bill payments for three months.Quotes:Stephen Hunt, director, United Steel Workers, District 32 Western Canada –“We’ve been hard hit by a variety of factors that have presented challenges to our forest workers. I am pleased that this government is taking steps to help our industry and forest communities in general.”Susan Yurkovich, president and CEO, Council of Forest Industries –“The deferral of stumpage fees is an important short-term measure to help alleviate some of the unprecedented financial pressure brought on by the COVID 19 crisis. It will help B.C.’s forest companies put people back to work in communities as markets come back and we move towards economic recovery.”Quick Facts:\\nThe stumpage system in B.C. is called the market pricing system.\\nStumpage is calculated every three months, ensuring companies that harvest on Crown land are paying a fair market rate and the people of B.C. are getting fair value.\\nUnlike Alberta’s tenure system, B.C. does not have a universal stumpage rate because B.C.’s forests are more diverse. Stumpage is based on volume of timber, species and grade.\\nThe money raised by stumpage funds vital social services.\\nLearn More:To see provincial COVID-19 supports for business and industry, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/tax-changes/covid-19-tax-changesFor a list of non-health related essential services, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/essential-services-covid-19B.C.

       "  '\\n\\nCrews\\xa0are doing\\xa0investigative fieldwork in the Kicking Horse Canyon over the next several weeks as part of the preparation for major highway improvements to begin late this year.Beginning Thursday, April 30, 2020, crews\\xa0are collecting physical data in the Dart Creek area, as well as other locations near the highway alignment. This fieldwork will help to inform the ongoing engineering design of the four-laning improvements to the Trans-Canada Highway through the canyon.\\xa0Workers will practise safe physical distancing and use personal protective equipment. Every effort will be made to minimize any environmental disturbance to the local area. Minimal traffic impacts are anticipated as this work is carried out.B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO) has directed employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres (6.5 feet) apart from each other, both in the course of their duties, as well as during breaks. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.While highways and roads remain open, the PHO recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.A design-build contract for the fourth and final phase of the Kicking Horse Canyon Project is expected to be awarded in late summer or early fall 2020, with initial construction to begin in the fall. It will bring the last remaining 4.8 kilometres of narrow, winding two-lane highway up to a modern four-lane, 100 km/h standard.The project is being delivered under the Province’s Community Benefits Agreement (CBA). It prioritizes hiring local workers, Indigenous peoples, women and other under-represented groups, and provides more training opportunities for apprentices, so they can complete their certification. The CBA ensures competitive, transparent wages with fair working conditions that foster a workplace free of discrimination and harassment and honours the cultural differences of all involved on the project.Learn More:For more information on this project, including flyover footage and a virtual reality simulation, visit: www.kickinghorsecanyon.caFor job opportunities for the Kicking Horse Canyon four-laning project, visit: https://www.bcib.ca/For guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNT\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency the previous day.The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 (1 888 268-4319) to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19.

We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.\"There have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 20 facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 12 care facilities.\"Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.\"As of today, 46 employees have now been confirmed positive at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam, and 34 employees are confirmed positive at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are also 120 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 11 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“Anyone who has been in Kearl Lake since March 24, or is a close contact of a worker and who has symptoms of COVID-19, is required to immediately self-isolate and should be tested. Visit the BC Centre for Disease Control website for information on a collection centre near you, or contact 811 or public health for information on testing.“To date, 1,231 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 94 individuals are currently hospitalized, 37 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Our first priority is to ensure the health of all British Columbians. Every decision, every order and restriction is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focused on containing COVID-19.“We use science as a foundation for our thinking, while recognizing that the actions we take also have significant social, financial and emotional implications.“It is a delicate balance, as demonstrated by the co-ordinated efforts to maintain learning for K-12 students throughout the province, while putting measures in place to protect students and teachers from transmission.“We must do all we can to ensure this as we develop our made-in-B.C. framework and create a ‘new normal’ for British Columbians.“While we look ahead, we must all remember that our vulnerable citizens are still vulnerable. Our Elders and seniors, as well as those with underlying health conditions, are at highest risk of severe illness and we must continue to protect them.“We must also ensure the capacity and tools we have developed within our health-care system to rapidly respond to an outbreak today are maintained.“What is important not to lose sight of is that we all have a role to play. The decisions you make today will affect all of us tomorrow.“Personal hygiene, safe physical distancing, staying away from others when ill. These are the core tenants of public health and the foundation of our path forward.“Our personal health precautions are directly correlated to the epidemiological curve. Let’s get this right and continue to do the right thing.”Learn More:Victims of family and sexual violence can find support from VictimLinkBC at: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/priority-populations/people-who-may-be-or-are-experiencing-violence\\nOr by calling 1 800 563-0808Victims of family and sexual violence can find support from Women’s Support Services at: https://www.bwss.org/\\nOr by calling 1 855 687-1868 or texting 604 652-1867For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceTo learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: https://gov.bc.ca/returningtravellersFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\nOr: www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, visit: www.bccdc.ca/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities:\\nOn Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\nOn Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nOr Youtube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_CN.pdf\\xa0A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe first aerial-spraying treatment to eradicate invasive gypsy moths from 241 hectares of residential and municipal park land in the Fraser Heights neighbourhood of Surrey will occur in the first week of May 2020, weather permitting.The gypsy moth is destructive to native and urban forests and orchards. Without treatment, it could spread to other parts of the province and put hundreds of species of trees and shrubs at risk, including in endangered Garry oak ecosystems.The spraying will be located north of 108th Avenue to Highway 17 (South Fraser Perimeter Road), west to Highway 401 and east to 162nd Street.Up to four separate treatments are required this spring. Spraying will be carried out by a fixed-wing aircraft. It will start shortly after sunrise (approximately 5:40 a.m.) and should be completed by 7:30 a.m. daily.Unless delayed by poor weather, each treatment is expected to take one to two mornings to apply. The ministry aims to complete the spraying by mid-June.The 241-hectare spray area will be treated with Foray 48B, which contains Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk). Btk is an organic, natural agent that has been approved for the control of gypsy moth larvae in Canada since 1961.Foray 48B and other Btk formulations received certification for acceptable use on certified organic farms by the Organic Materials Review Institute of Canada in April 2018.Btk is naturally present in urban, forest and agricultural soil throughout the province. It does not harm humans, mammals, birds, fish, plants, reptiles, amphibians, bees or other insects and affects caterpillars only after they have ingested it.The spray will be applied by a low-flying plane. Residents within and adjacent to the treatment area will likely hear the aircraft at some point during the treatment. The spray equipment is GPS-calibrated and controlled. Spraying will occur only when the plane is immediately over the treatment area.Poor weather or wind may cause treatments to be postponed with little advance notice.For program updates, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/gypsymothIndividuals subscribed to the gypsy moth listserv (automated email updates) will receive program updates. The telephone line will be staffed during business hours and will provide up-to-date spray schedules and recorded information 24 hours a day.Anyone wishing to minimize contact with the spray material may choose to remain indoors with their windows and doors closed during the treatment, and for at least 30 minutes after.Pets and livestock that may be frightened by the aircraft should be secured or brought indoors.Learn More:Subscribe to the gypsy moth listserv: http://lists.gov.bc.ca/mailman/listinfo/l_for_gypsymothLearn more about gypsy moths: www.gov.bc.ca/gypsymoth\\nOr call toll-free 1 866 917-5999 for up-to-date spray schedules and recorded information 24 hours a day.For health information any time of day or night, call HealthLinkBC at 811, toll-free and available in more than 30 languages.

It also includes cost estimates to upgrade the rail line to meet the standards needed to implement a commuter service with frequent train service between Victoria and Langford (Westhills), as well as inter-city service between Victoria and Courtenay.The ministry is currently developing the South Island Transportation Strategy, focusing on the efficient movement of people and goods. The strategy will look at all modes of transportation across southern Vancouver Island, including rail. The strategy is expected to be released in June.The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure engaged WSP Canada Group Ltd. to conduct the detailed evaluation of the Island Rail Corridor on Vancouver Island.

Vendors are operating at rest areas, weigh scales and other commercial truck pullouts throughout the Lower Mainland and southern Interior, with more expected to be added in the coming weeks.Current locations on provincial property with permitted food trucks, providing commercial truck drivers with more food options during their travels:\\nNordel CVSE Inspection Station in Delta\\nZopkios Brake Check on Highway 5, approximately 57 kilometres north of Hope\\nBritton Creek Rest Area on Highway 5, approximately 62 kilometres south of Merritt\\nKamloops Weigh Scale in City of Kamloops – food served free of cost once per week by the Salvation Army\\nFood truck operating times will vary at these locations. In a separate initiative, members of the BC Trucking Association have spearheaded the Meals for Truck Drivers BC pilot, setting up food trucks at various commercial cardlocks throughout the province. Restaurants have also reopened many locations along Canadian highways for take out and restroom use for commercial drivers.Commercial truck drivers play an important role in maintaining the supply chain by delivering essential goods during the COVID-19 pandemic. The drivers ensure people around the province continue to have access to the items they need, including food and medicine. For these reasons, the ministry is working in collaboration with private food truck operators in order to help provide more options for truck drivers on their routes.Along with allowing food trucks, the Province has recently completed the installation of more than 25 portable toilets at commercial pullouts and inspection stations in the province to improve travel for commercial truck drivers.The ministry is following the advice and orders of the provincial health officer and the federal government to keep British Columbians as safe as possible and help stop the spread of COVID-19. While highways and roads remain open, the provincial health officer recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.Learn More:For a constantly updated map of locations and times for these food trucks, visit the Meals for Truckers page: https://mealsfortruckers.ca/Food truck operators interested in applying for a permit can go to: http://ow.ly/ME1d50zo3uFFor travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For a French translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.28_IB_Trucker_Food_Trucks-French.pdfFor a Punjabi translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.28_IB_Trucker_Food_Trucks-Punjabi.pdf\\xa0For a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.28_IB_Trucker_Food_Trucks-TC.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Today, we honour them and acknowledge the grief felt by their family and friends who miss them.“Everyone deserves to work in a safe environment.

Essential workers are demonstrating great courage and dedication simply by doing their jobs during this challenging time.“Our government is determined to keep people safe on the job during this pandemic. We are following direction from Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. We are committed to making sure that workers know their rights and have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information on how to keep workplaces safe and healthy.\\xa0And, under the leadership of Harry Bains, Minister of Labour, our government is working to make British Columbia workplaces the safest in Canada, today and every day.“To all those who continue to work during this crisis: thank you for keeping B.C.’s lights on.

In total, 19 facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 11 care facilities.\"Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, and we expect to continue to see more cases in the coming days as contact tracing continues.\"As of today, 18 employees have now been confirmed positive at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam, and 35 employees are confirmed positive at United Poultry in Vancouver. Additionally, there are 11 confirmed positive cases connected to the Kearl Lake project in Alberta and 118 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre.“To date, 1,137 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 96 individuals are currently hospitalized, 41 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“As we continue to move forward with our COVID-19 response, it is important that we don’t leave vulnerable British Columbians behind. Everyone deserves to be safe, feel protected and have the support they need.“We have two public health emergencies in our province, the overdose crisis and now COVID-19, making daily life an even greater struggle for many.“Keeping a safe physical distance from others and staying home when ill are the best things we can do with COVID-19, but we recognize this can be extremely difficult for those with precarious housing.“This is further compounded for people who may also face mental-health and addiction issues.“To address these challenges, today the Province announced important action to provide safe housing, food and wraparound support for people living in encampments in Victoria and Vancouver.“The addition of more than 1,000 hotel rooms provides a further means for vulnerable citizens to have access to secure housing with the necessary health-care and mental-health supports.“This action is welcome news, reducing the immediate health and safety risks for people living in temporary encampments.“We also know that being home more can unfortunately lead to increased stress and, in some cases, violence.“If you are experiencing violence, we want you to know that you are not alone. VictimLinkBC is available 24/7 to provide information and services to all victims of crime, in addition to immediate crisis support for victims of family and sexual violence.“We must do all we can to protect and support each other.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Province is working with the cities of Vancouver and Victoria to transition people living in encampments in Oppenheimer Park, Topaz Park and on Pandora Avenue into safe, temporary accommodations with wraparound supports to protect their health and safety in the overlapping COVID-19 and overdose crises.Since March 2020, the Province, in partnership with BC Housing and local municipalities, has worked to secure and operate 686 hotel and community centre accommodations in Vancouver and 324 hotel spaces in Victoria. This allows people from the encampments to safely physically distance, with access to important health, social and other supports.“Providing\\xa0safe, temporary accommodations and wraparound services for people facing homelessness has been an urgent priority for this government for a long time,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Now, more than ever, with the concurrent emergencies of the pandemic and the ongoing opioid crisis, it is time to implement long-term housing solutions that take care of and protect our most vulnerable people.”This is a step toward providing permanent housing for people in these encampments. BC Housing, non-profit and health authority staff, provincial community-integration specialists and municipal staff will be working directly with people living in these three encampments and will help transition people into safer accommodations. There, they will have their own living space and access to services, such as meals, laundry, washroom facilities, health-care services, addictions treatment and harm reduction, storage for personal belongings and other supports.This is the next step in a phased approach, developed in co-ordination and collaboration with local governments and service delivery partners, to support vulnerably housed people living with elevated risk during two public health emergencies – the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing overdose crisis.\\xa0“Having a roof over your head, access to food, health care and social supports are all essential to finding a pathway to hope,”\\xa0said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “As we stare down not one, but two public health emergencies, we are saying that we won’t leave anyone behind.”\\xa0\\xa0By transitioning vulnerable people into more secure accommodations, the Province is focused on reducing the immediate health and safety risks to people living and working in these densely populated\\xa0encampments, as well as those in the neighbouring communities.“Every day I am inspired by the tremendous leadership the Province has shown British Columbians,” said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “This approach to helping our most vulnerable residents is thoughtful, prudent and ultimately will keep all of us safer during this pandemic.”This transition is supported by an order under the Emergency Program Act under the provincial state of emergency issued by Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, as part of the Province’s all-of-government response to COVID-19. The order sets May 9, 2020, as the deadline to transition people out of the encampments.“In this provincial state of emergency, our priority is public safety: for those living in these encampments, neighbouring communities and front-line workers delivering services to these vulnerable people,” Farnworth said. “We are committed to working in partnership with local governments and law enforcement to address the elevated health and safety risks within and around these encampments, while making sure people have access to the critical services they need.”The Province is working on comprehensive long-term plans to secure permanent housing with appropriate supports for those leaving the encampments and moving into safe, temporary accommodations. These plans will include strategies that will mitigate a return to homelessness\\xa0and will also make sure the many public safety concerns at the current encampments are addressed, including fire code violations, property crime and sexual violence.These accommodations are in addition to the more than 1,739 beds that have been secured for vulnerable people, including those experiencing homelessness, in other hotel rooms, community centres and emergency response centres across the province.\\xa0This step also supports additional and existing work done to date by the COVID-19 Vulnerable Populations Working Group, regional health authorities, BC Housing and the cities of Vancouver and Victoria.Quotes:\\xa0Cheryl Casimer, political executive, First Nations Summit –“We would like to acknowledge the efforts of the provincial government and all partners involved in developing a strategy for the Downtown Eastside (DTES). Although the strategy announced today includes a temporary plan to address urgent housing and social service supports needed to curtail the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak in the DTES, it will also allow the Province and primary partners to work towards addressing the much needed long-term housing and wellness strategies and needs to support the DTES community. Based on reports that a second wave of COVID-19 is possible, it is absolutely necessary that these long-term needs are addressed on a priority basis.”Regional Chief Terry Teegee,\\xa0B.C. Assembly of First Nations –“These necessary supports for vulnerable members of the DTES community as well as other communities are much needed during this unprecedented health crisis. I applaud the efforts of the provincial government and other partners in addressing the housing and health-related realities that residents are facing. We must continue to advance and ensure long-term collaborative supports as we work to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”Learn More:The related order under the Emergency Program Act under the provincial state of emergency can be viewed here: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/M128-2020.pdfFor an overview of BC Housing’s work to monitor and respond to COVID-19, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/For more information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For a Punjabi translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.25_NR_Safe_Space_in_Encampments-Punjabi.pdfFor a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.25_NR_Safe_Space_in_Encampments-TC.pdfThree backgrounders follow.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nTo help communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, targeted funding will give people in rural, remote and Indigenous communities in British Columbia access to faster internet services at a time when they need them most.The $50-million Connecting British Columbia program now includes a funding stream to help internet service providers with immediate network equipment upgrades to rapidly improve capacity and internet speeds in underserved communities throughout the province.“People working from home, students learning remotely and families practising physical distancing all need to know they can depend on internet access during this public-health emergency,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services. “Responding to the pandemic requires the best from all of us. Our communities need reliable internet access right now, and this new fund will get projects completed quickly.”Physical distancing requirements resulting from the COVID-19 public-health emergency mean more people are staying home to work, study or be with their families. Internet service providers (ISPs) have reported an increased demand on networks, which in some cases can cause slowdowns or even outages. Connecting British Columbia’s COVID-19 response funding will enable ISPs to make immediate upgrades to their networks in order to better support the people who count on their services.“The British Columbia Broadband Association really appreciates the effort to provide immediate assistance to internet service providers as they work to upgrade networks serving people during this public health emergency,” said Bob Allen, BCBA president. “Our members are excited to deliver new projects by the end of June that will provide immediate improvements to high-speed internet services for people.”Internet service providers throughout the province can apply for grants of up to $50,000 – or 90% of their expenses – to cover the cost of equipment, including antennas, electronics or other types of devices that relate to the performance or range of their network.These are types of network upgrades that can be completed quickly to significantly improve connectivity for people, rather than the traditional projects that usually require months or years to finish.Applications are now being accepted by Northern Development Initiative Trust. Submissions will be reviewed on a first-come-first-served basis, with funding decisions made within three to five business days. Internet service providers must complete their projects by June 30, 2020.“We all have to work together to protect the health and safety of our families and neighbours,” said Joel McKay, CEO, Northern Development Initiative Trust. “Immediate investments in network upgrades can help ensure that people have the reliable internet access they need, not just to work and study from home, but to keep in touch remotely with friends and family during this challenging time.”Grants will be funded through the existing Connecting British Columbia program. Applications are being accepted for both the new COVID-19 response funding and the existing Phase 3 Connecting British Columbia quarterly intake.Since July 2017, 479 communities, including 83 Indigenous communities, have benefited from completed or underway Connecting British Columbia high-speed internet connectivity projects.Learn More:Application for Connecting British Columbia COVID-19 response funding: https://www.northerndevelopment.bc.ca/funding-programs/partner-programs/connecting-british-columbia/phase-three-last-mile-transport-infrastructure/Connecting British Columbia Program: https://www.northerndevelopment.bc.ca/funding-programs/partner-programs/connecting-british-columbia/Phase 3 Connecting British Columbia funding application information: https://www.northerndevelopment.bc.ca/funding-programs/partner-programs/connecting-british-columbia/phase-three-last-mile-transport-infrastructure/\\xa0Connectivity in British Columbia: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/connectivity-in-bc\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThousands of small businesses in British Columbia will see their monthly rent reduced by at least 75%, thanks to the new federal-provincial Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program (CECRA).“While many small businesses have closed their doors to help keep people safe and healthy, this has not stopped the bills from coming in,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “British Columbia is pleased to partner with the federal government on the CECRA, a welcome next step that will help thousands of commercial property owners and tenants in British Columbia.”Launching in mid-May 2020, the CECRA will see B.C. small businesses receive a total of over $300 million in federal-provincial relief, with B.C. contributing an estimated $80 million.The 75% reduction in monthly rent for small businesses affected by COVID-19 will be achieved by providing forgivable loans to cover 50% of the rent payments for eligible small business tenants for April, May and June.The loans will be forgiven if the landlord reduces the tenant’s monthly rent by at least 75%. The commercial tenant would be responsible for covering 25%, the property owner 25%, while the federal and provincial governments share the remaining 50%.“This program is not just about providing relief for people today, it’s also about planning for our future and making sure that businesses and local economies are ready to be part of B.C.’s economic recovery,” James added. “We look forward to working with the federal government on the details of this program, as well as future opportunities to keep all B.C. businesses and communities resilient throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.”The CECRA will be administered by the federal government through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.In addition to commercial rent relief, the B.C. government is offering significant support to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, including tax reductions, delays and deferrals.Quick Facts:\\nThe\\xa0Province has reduced most commercial property taxes by an average of 25%, providing up to $700 million in relief. To give commercial landlords and businesses more time to pay their reduced property taxes,\\xa0late payment penalties for commercial properties (classes 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) have been waived until Oct. 1, 2020.\\nBusinesses with a payroll over $500,000 can defer their employer health tax payments until Sept. 30, 2020. Businesses with a payroll under this threshold are already exempt.\\nPayments for provincial sales tax, hotel tax, carbon tax, motor fuel tax and tobacco tax are also deferred.\\nBC Hydro rates have been reduced by 1%.

       "  \"\\n\\nB.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO) has released an order for industrial camps and guidelines to protect people\\xa0working in the silviculture sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.This is\\xa0to help contractors, tree planting operators and their employees reduce the risks of COVID-19.“B.C. continues to be a leader in the fight against COVID-19, and now is the time to reinforce our efforts to keep people safe and healthy,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Tree planting is crucial to the health of our forests, and we are instituting strict measures based on the PHO's expert direction to make sure that it is done in a way that protects workers and the people of British Columbia.”On April 23, 2020, Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s PHO, issued an order for industrial camps that applies to workers in the agricultural, aquacultural, forestry and resource sectors, as well as\\xa0those who provide accommodation for these workers. This order sets out prevention, control and inspection protocols for workers and employers.Every year, about 5,000 tree planters, primarily from B.C. and other Canadian provinces, travel\\xa0to work in remote camps and communities throughout the province. This year, to reduce and mitigate the risks of COVID-19, all tree planters will be subject to strict screening procedures for COVID-19 symptoms before admission to field camps or community accommodations.The BC Centre for Disease Control guidelines for those working in the silviculture sector require:\\nscreening of workers for symptoms or potential COVID-19 exposure;\\nadded hygiene measures in camps, including handwashing stations;\\ntraining workers on how to stay safe while travelling to camp and to worksites;\\nfood preparation guidelines;\\nlimiting travel outside of camp; and\\nhaving at least one infection and control co-ordinator at each site.\\n“Recent planting completed on the coast shows that when workers and contractors take appropriate steps to make sure health and safety measures are followed, tree planting can safely take place,” said John Betts, executive director, Western Forestry Contractors’ Association. “Our members began implementing additional steps to protect workers and the public very early on, and it is working.”All tree planting employers are required to implement an infection prevention control plan\\xa0for work camp locations, including field camps and hotel/motel accommodations, and must submit these plans to the ministry. All forestry camps, accommodations and worksites will be inspected by provincial prevention and control officers to ensure all required health and safety measures are in place. In addition, the Province has implemented on-site security at motels and hotels to ensure tree planters adhere to the PHO’s orders and guidance.“We have heard from rural/remote communities about wanting to make sure work in communities can continue safely, and that is why we have worked collaboratively to develop these guidelines for tree planting,” Donaldson said. “Additionally, we recently announced a new collaborative framework that will help make sure people living in rural, remote and Indigenous communities in B.C. have access to critical health care they can count on to meet their unique needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and into the future.”The framework was developed through a partnership between the First Nations Health Authority, Northern Health and Provincial Health Services Authority. The work is guided by the principles of cultural safety and humility, and adds to work underway by the Rural Coordination Centre of BC.The framework provides flexibility so local leaders in rural, remote and Indigenous communities can adapt it to meet their unique needs. It will be implemented through full engagement with each of the communities’ local leaders.\\xa0On March 26, 2020, the Province, in consultation with the\\xa0PHO, identified jobs and industries deemed as essential to maintaining vital goods and services, and supporting the Province’s ongoing response to COVID-19. This is distinct from essential service designations under the Province's Labour Relations Code.Forestry and silviculture were included in the list of essential services because they provide a continuous supply of items, such as wood, pulp and paper, and soft-pulp products, which are like those used to make medical supplies, such as protective masks, drapes and screens.Learn More:PHO industrial camp order and delegation are available here:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusSilviculture guidance document:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/covid-19/covid-19-pho-guidance-work-camps-silviculture.pdfFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, visit:\\xa0www.bccdc.ca/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nFacebook:\\xa0www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0\\nTwitter:\\xa0https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nYouTube:\\xa0www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian\\xa0Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today,\\xa0we are announcing 29 new cases, for a total of 1,824 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 755 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 760 are in the Fraser Health region, 111 are in the Island Health region, 156 are in the Interior Health region and 42 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report four new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions, for a total of 94 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been one new outbreak at Orchard Manor at Hawthorn Park in the Interior Health region. There are also two new acute-care outbreaks: one at Ridge Meadows Hospital in the Fraser Health region and one at Lions Gate Hospital in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. In total, 20 facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks declared over at 10 care facilities.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks.“A second poultry facility, Superior Poultry in Coquitlam, has two confirmed cases of COVID-19. Fraser Health public health teams are working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, who is responsible for this facility to manage the outbreak and support with active contact tracing.“In addition to the new cases at Superior Poultry, as of today, 29 employees have now been confirmed positive at the United Poultry Company in Vancouver, and 78 inmates and staff are confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre.“To date, 1,092 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 103 individuals are currently hospitalized, 44 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“A new public health order and guidance for agriculture, aquaculture, forestry and natural resources sectors are being provided to industry today to protect the safety of workers and communities as we manage through this pandemic.“The challenge for all of us right now is to recognize that COVID-19 will be in our communities for many months to come.“What this means, is that in order for us to get to a point where we can ease restrictions in B.C., we have to reach a manageable number of new cases: one that does not overwhelm our health-care system, so we can continue to provide the best care possible for all those who are ill.“It is a careful balance, and as we have seen with the recent increase in community outbreaks, it is a balance that is difficult to find.“A misstep in the wrong direction puts us all at risk. A playdate for your children, a gathering with friends, non-essential travel – any of these actions exponentially increase potential exposures to COVID-19 for ourselves and those we care for most.“This is not forever. We will get through this hurricane in the safest, best way possible. But now is most certainly not the time to tip the scales against us. Rather, it is a time for patience and resilience, to demonstrate to each other that in the face of our pandemic, we are standing strong.”Learn More:For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceTo learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit: http://www.phsa.ca/staff-resources/covid-19-resources-for-staff/staff-covid-19-testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers \\xa0For mental health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\nOr: www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0 http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, visit: www.bccdc.ca/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities:\\nOn Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\nOn Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nOn\\xa0Youtube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nMore than 2,500 essential service workers on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic have been referred to open child care spaces through the Province’s new child care matching process.Less than a month after the Province launched its new child care matching process, essential service workers throughout British Columbia are dropping their children off at licensed child care spaces in their communities.\\xa0More than 2,650 essential service workers have been referred to a licensed child care provider through the Province’s matching plan. This process helps\\xa0match parents, who are working on the front lines of B.C.’s COVID-19 response and have children up to five years of age, with licensed child care spaces.The spaces are prioritized for children whose parents work in public health and health services, social services and law enforcement, first responders and emergency response sectors. Additional spaces are going to families working in other essential roles.For essential service workers with children older than five years, the Ministry of Education has been working closely with school districts and independent schools to ensure these students have access to in-school supports during regular school hours and access to care before and after school hours.The Province is supporting thousands of child care centres during the COVID-19 crisis. So far, the government has invested $38 million to ensure essential service workers continue to have access to reliable licensed child care, and centres that close are able to reopen.As of April 16, 2020, 2,530 child care centres offering up to 58,650 spaces around B.C. are receiving funding through the Temporary Emergency Funding Program to remain open. The program provides eligible licensed providers with funding at a rate of seven times their average monthly child care operating base funding.Child care centres receiving this funding continue to be eligible for the Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative and the Early Childhood Educator (ECE) Wage Enhancement. The fee reduction helps parents by providing funding for licensed child care providers to reduce and stabilize their monthly child care fees. The wage enhancement has provided nearly 12,000 ECEs with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, which increased to $2 per hour on April 1, 2020, to better recognize the work they do.In addition, families accessing care from these providers may be eligible for the Affordable Child Care Benefit. As of March 2020, more than 51,500 families have benefited from it.Child care providers who have closed due to COVID-19 are also receiving support to help ensure they are able to pay their fixed costs – like rent, lease and mortgage payments – during the temporary closure, so they will be able to reopen. Just over 1,400 facilities have closed and are receiving two times their average monthly operating funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 20% of an average group facility’s monthly operating expenses. Smaller licensed home-based child care providers are eligible for these supports.To support families who may be struggling with loss of employment and income, child care providers receiving these extra payments must not charge parents fees for any periods of closure or for any vacant spaces while they are open, including when a parent chooses to temporarily withdraw a child due to COVID-19.As British Columbians navigate these uncertain times together, parents who can are asked to continue to care for their children at home. All children and staff who are ill with a fever, or have cold, influenza or infectious respiratory symptoms of any kind, must stay home.Government will continue to be guided by the recommendations and advice of the provincial health officer to ensure British Columbia continues to stop the spread of COVID-19, while looking at safe ways to resume important aspects of society, including child care.\\xa0The provincial health officer and B.C. government have designated that essential service\\xa0workers get priority access to child care so they can continue to provide the essential services people rely on in their daily lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.Learn More:Essential workers looking for child care can fill out a “parent” form to identify their need for urgent child care. Forms can be accessed online: www.gov.bc.ca/essential-service-child-care\\nOr by calling (toll-free) 1 888 338-6622 and selecting Option 4.\\nParents who are not in an essential service role are asked to care for their children at home if possible, or complete the form to find an available space nearby at a licensed centre after priority has been given to essential service\\xa0workers.The Ministry of Health has developed guidelines to inform child care operators, early childhood educators and licensing officers on implementation of best practices, e.g., guidelines on what physical distancing measures are appropriate in a child care setting.

Applications over the phone will begin on May 4.Payments will start to go out within days of application. While there may be minor delays during the initial surge, government staff will be working to quickly process payments.The benefit is part of the Province’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people and\\xa0businesses, and to support the services people count on.The action plan builds on the federal government’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan and delivers other key supports for people, including:\\nenhancing the B.C. Climate Action Tax Credit to provide up to $218 per adult and up to $64 per child in July 2020;\\nintroducing a rental supplement of $300 per month for eligible households with no dependents and $500 per month for eligible households with dependents;\\nproviding an emergency $300 per month for the next three months to individuals receiving income assistance or disability assistance and who are not eligible for EI or the CERB;\\nfreezing all B.C. student loan repayments, interest free, until Sept. 30, 2020;\\nhalting all evictions due to non-payment of rent for the duration of this emergency;\\ndelaying several tax filing and payment deadlines for income tax, the employer health tax, provincial sales tax, municipal and regional district tax, motor fuel tax, carbon tax and tobacco tax;\\nreducing the school property tax rate for commercial properties to achieve an average 25% reduction in the total property tax bill for most businesses; and\\nchanging the Employment Standards Act to ensure immediate job-protected unpaid leave for workers affected by COVID-19, so they can stay home as needed. \\xa0\\nLearn More:To review BCEBW eligibility and subscribe for notification when the application process opens online, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/workerbenefitTo learn more about the supports and services available for people, businesses and communities through the pandemic, visit:\\xa0https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/financial-benefitsFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\xa0\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.23_NR_BC_Emergency_Benefit_for_Workers_Applications-CH.pdfFor a Farsi translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.23_NR_BC_Emergency_Benefit_for_Workers_Applications-Farsi.pdfFor a French translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.23_NR_BC_Emergency_Benefit_for_Workers_Applications-FR.pdf\\xa0For a Punjabi\\xa0translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.23_NR_BC_Emergency_Benefit_for_Workers_Applications-Punjabi.pdf\\xa0For a Spanish translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.23_NR_BC_Emergency_Benefit_for_Workers_Applications-Spanish.pdfFor a Tagalog translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.23_NR_BC_Emergency_Benefit_for_Workers_Applications-Tagalog.pdfFor a Korean translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.23_NR_BC_Emergency_Benefit_for_Workers_Applications-Korean.pdf\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian\\xa0Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today,\\xa0we are announcing 71 new cases, for a total of 1,795 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 745 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 747 are in the Fraser Health region, 110 are in the Island Health region, 153 are in the Interior Health region and 40 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions, for a total of 90 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been three new outbreaks in long-term care and assisted-living facilities in the last day, at the Eden Care Centre, the Guildford Seniors Village and the New Vista Society. In total, 19 facilities and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 10 care facilities.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks.“Vancouver\\xa0Coastal is working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to manage the outbreak at the United Poultry Company. To date, 28 employees have been confirmed positive.“Fraser Health continues to work with Correction Services Canada to manage the outbreak at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, which now\\xa0has 77 cases of COVID-19.“To date, 1,079 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 103 individuals are currently hospitalized, 46 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We continue to experience new community outbreaks in our province. This tells us that we have more work to do to break the chains of transmission.“We have been clear from the outset, we are taking a whole-province approach and we need every individual, every business and every community to do that same. We cannot afford to have any weakness in our firewall that will result in a surge in new cases.“To ease restrictions, we need a continued decline in both the number of new cases and the number of outbreaks. Until we clear that important hurdle, we can’t begin to make changes.“We know that many people experience mild symptoms, making it difficult to determine if you have COVID-19 and increasing the likelihood of transmission.“That is why it is critically important that if you are ill – whether you feel it is a cold, allergies or COVID-19 – to stay home, stay away from all others and contact your health-care provider or call 811 to get tested.“We also need employers to do the responsible thing and have measures in place to ensure everyone who is working is healthy and allow employees to keep their colleagues safe, by staying home when ill.“Employers also need to understand that an outbreak in your business has a significant impact. An immediate shutdown is required and your business will only be able to open once public health officials are confident that you can operate without putting your employees or the community in harms way.“Those sectors and businesses who are looking ahead to reopening need to think about three things: processes to open safely, measures to keep people safe to avoid further outbreaks and a plan in the event that a case or an outbreak should occur.“B.C. companies, societies and co-operatives can now use electronic meetings during the Province’s state of emergency to ensure the order restricting gatherings of more than 50 people is followed.“We must remain 100% committed to working together in our common purpose to see us through this storm.”Learn More:To learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit: http://www.phsa.ca/staff-resources/covid-19-resources-for-staff/staff-covid-19-testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit:\\xa0gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers \\xa0For mental health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\nOr: www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, visit: www.bccdc.ca/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities:\\nOn Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\nOn Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nOn\\xa0Youtube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a French translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.22_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_FR.pdfFor a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.22_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nTo ensure vulnerable students do not face barriers to learning while in-class instruction is suspended, B.C.’s school districts are finding innovative ways to provide families with more than 75,000 healthy meals a week.“No student should ever have to go without food, whether they’re learning in class or at home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Despite the challenging times we’re living in, school-district staff have partnered with local non-profits and businesses in a community effort to ensure kids and their families are getting the nutritious food they need, no matter where they live or learn.”The Government of B.C. provides $53.2 million through CommunityLINK (Learning Includes Nutrition and Knowledge) annually for the province’s 60 school districts to support vulnerable students with services that include meal programs. Twenty-five school districts also receive a combined $11.2 million from the Province through the Vulnerable Student Supplement, which addresses growth in vulnerable student populations.In school districts of all sizes, staff acted quickly to use their resources and work with community organizations and local businesses to ensure students who normally received meals at school would continue to have them at home.Teachers, education assistants, administrators and school support staff are putting together weekly grocery hampers for families, delivering food boxes and bagged lunches to homes and setting up designated hubs for meal pick-up. Some school districts are also providing grocery store gift cards and vouchers, while others have formed partnerships with caterers, non-profits, restaurants, local businesses and food banks to support vulnerable families. More than 16,000 families are receiving these services throughout the province.“So many people are stepping up to make sure students are getting nutritious meals at home,” Fleming said. “This important work is giving vulnerable families throughout the province the support they need to help their children thrive away from the traditional classroom setting.”School districts from every corner of the province are developing their own unique plans to meet the needs of their communities.The Surrey School District immediately implemented a meal pick-up and delivery program, with staff in various positions stepping up to help bring food to students. In the Cowichan Valley, the school district teamed up with Shawnigan Lake school, Nourish Cowichan, Rotary and other community partners to deliver meals to students and families.About 40% of families in Arrow Lakes are being supported by their school district with meals through a combination of hamper and food-box deliveries, food vouchers and partnerships with local caterers.In the Bulkley Valley, school district administrators have worked with the Smithers Volunteer Fire Department, as well as district staff, to co-ordinate food delivery for families in need. In Richmond, the school district collaborated with its Feed-U-Cate-38 program, non-profits and local businesses to have groceries delivered straight to students’ houses.And in the Kelowna area, Central Okanagan Public school has teamed up with Brown Bag Lunch and Food for Thought to provide thousands of meals for local families, with weekly pick-ups that help maintain physical distance.In addition to CommunityLINK and Vulnerable Student Supplement funding, the Province is supporting families by shifting the focus of the B.C. School Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional Program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will deliver fruits and vegetables to low-income families with children through Food Banks BC, in partnership with schools and community-based youth programs.Quotes:Paul Faoro, president, CUPE BC\\xa0–“CUPE K-12 support staff including education assistants, custodians, bus drivers, clerical and IT (information technology), to name just a few, are here when you need us. Members throughout B.C. are stepping up to support students and their families through this pandemic. We’re all in this together.”Teri Mooring, president, BC Teachers’ Federation\\xa0\\xa0–“The creative and meaningful ways the Ministry of Education, school districts, teachers and CUPE staff are coming together to ensure children and families get the support they need is a great example of how well the sector is working together during these challenging times. When in-school classes were suspended, finding ways to support vulnerable children and youth was top of mind for everyone. The K–12 sector is working extremely hard and I'm very proud of what's happening in our communities.”Learn More:Learn more about the Ministry of Education’s CommunityLINK program: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/administration/program-management/communitylinkFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

It’s an important part of what makes our province so unique. People in B.C. have consistently been ahead of the curve on environmental protection, and this tradition continues to this day.“Together, we are rising to the collective challenge of climate change. In B.C., we have one of the strongest climate action plans on the continent – CleanBC. CleanBC is a blueprint to help build a cleaner, better future for people living in communities throughout the province.“Last fall, British Columbians made their voices heard by marching for strong action on climate change. In October, our government added better accountability and improved transparency to our CleanBC plan by introducing the Climate Change Accountability Act.“On Earth Day, we reaffirm our commitment to taking action for the benefit of future generations.“We have shown there is no limit to what we can accomplish together when we work toward a common purpose. It has never been more important to understand and value the connection between the health of the planet and the health of people.

       "  '\\n\\nBritish Columbia is in the midst of two major public health emergencies. The first is the on-going overdose crisis, and while overall death rates have started to come down, it continues to take a heart-breaking toll on families and communities across B.C. The second, of course, is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has drastically changed all our lives.During this unprecedented time, it is critically important that we take extra care of each other, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities. We need to protect individual and community health and safety, and that includes protecting people who are at dual risk of COVID-19 and fentanyl poisoning.If you are struggling with addiction, if you are homeless or under-housed, or if you have to visit a clinic or pharmacy to receive medications every single day, following Dr. Bonnie Henry’s orders on physical distancing or self-isolation can feel almost impossible. And with an increasingly toxic street drug supply, people who use drugs are at considerable risk during the pandemic. \\xa0That’s why, as soon as Health Canada provided exemptions under the Controlled Substances Act, the Province and the BC Centre on Substance Use (BCCSU) acted quickly to release new clinical guidance for physicians, nurse practitioners and pharmacists to help people experiencing the symptoms of withdrawal, and people at risk of overdose and/ or at risk of COVID-19 infection.Now, across the province, safe prescription alternatives to the unpredictable and toxic drug supply can be safely prescribed and delivered to those in greatest need. This includes providing safer alternatives for people with addictions to alcohol, opioids, tobacco, stimulants and benzodiazepines. While we are making access to safer prescription medications easier – through virtual care, flexible delivery by pharmacies, and other measures – \\xa0we are also helping to flatten the curve of COVID-19.The new provincial guidance is practical and evidence-informed. It is rooted in the fact that addiction is a health issue, not a moral failing – and that people living with addiction deserve the same dignity, respect and access to quality care as people living with any other health condition. The provincial guidance is about safety and health during two public health emergencies – period.It takes courage to reach out and ask for help. But I want to encourage anyone who is facing these challenges, or knows someone who is, to talk to their health-care provider. In order to benefit from the new guidance, people don’t need to have been accessing substance use treatment already. People living with addiction shouldn’t have to risk their lives to get the safe prescription medication they need.In the coming months, we will continue to work hard to make life safer for people at risk as we navigate dual public health emergencies. No matter where you might be on your own journey -- \\xa0if you are accessing an overdose prevention service, or have just started on medication assisted treatment, or have been in recovery for many years -- each person should be supported on their\\xa0 own unique pathway to healing and hope.At this time of so much uncertainty - with a global pandemic on top of a fentanyl poisoning crisis - we need to look out for each other now more than ever.We can’t afford to stop caring about one health-care crisis as we stare down another.To find out if the guidance could help you or a loved one, talk to your doctor or nurse practitioner, or call 811 to be directed to supports in your region.

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 25 new cases, for a total of 1,724 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 707 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 715 are in the Fraser Health region, 109 are in the Island Health region, 153 are in the Interior Health region and 40 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report one new COVID-19 related death in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 87 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new outbreaks in long-term care and assisted-living facilities the last day. In total, 20 facilities and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks, with outbreaks declared over at six care facilities.“An outbreak has been identified at the United Poultry Company in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. To date, 28 employees have been confirmed positive through active contact tracing by public heath. Close contacts have been notifed and ordered to self-isolate. The plant has been closed to slow further transmission, and public health teams are providing support.“The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is responsible for ensuring the safety of food products. According to CFIA, there is no evidence to suggest that food is a likely source or route of transmission for the virus. Therefore, no recall of chicken products distributed from this plant is required. Good hygiene practices should still be followed during food handling and preparation, such as:\\nwashing hands with soap and water;\\nregularly cleaning and disinfecting surfaces;\\ncooking meat thoroughly; and\\navoiding potential cross-contamination between cooked and uncooked foods.\\n“Fraser Health continues to work with Correction Services Canada to manage the outbreak at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, which now has 76 cases of COVID-19.“A reminder that anyone who was at Kearl Lake project, near Fort McMurray, Alta., from March onward is ordered by the provincial health officer to immediately self-isolate for 14 days and contact your primary care provider, 811 or local public health team.“To date, 1,041 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 109 individuals are hospitalized, and 51 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Our goal is to do all we can to limit the potential for transmission and minimize the impact of necessary public health measures.“Throughout B.C., you have stepped up. Despite the hardships, you have recognized the importance of maintaining safe physical distance, being mindful of those around you, keeping our communities strong and showing compassion and care.“Even though you may be feeling the strain, we need everyone to keep going. We are at an important crossroads with our COVID-19 response. Every day counts, and every action you take makes a difference.“Many are looking ahead and thinking about getting back to work. Now is the time to start thinking about how you can do that safely with precautions in place.“Our focus is to ensure the storm has lessened, so that our workers, entrepreneurs and business owners can join the essential workers who have done so much these past weeks to keep our economy going.“Let’s stay vigilant, connected and committed. We will get through this by remaining united and working together in our common purpose to flatten the curve.”Learn More:To learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit:\\nhttp://www.phsa.ca/staff-resources/covid-19-resources-for-staff/staff-covid-19-testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/self-isolation-on-return\\xa0For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\xa0\\nOr: www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, visit: www.bccdc.ca/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.21_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfFor a French translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.21_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_FR.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nProvincial emergency COVID-19 funding will be distributed through Community Living BC (CLBC) to ensure people with developmental disabilities stay supported and safe during the pandemic.As part of the B.C. Government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan, up to $35.6 million will be available over three months from CLBC to support service providers to continue delivering residential services, including group homes, home sharing and supported independent living that about 9,500 adults with developmental disabilities count on.“This pandemic has had a significant impact on agencies and home-sharing providers who perform essential care and services, creating challenges for people with developmental disabilities and their families,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “This funding will ensure that quality of care and staffing levels are maintained so that the people who depend on these services remain safe and supported.”Under this temporary emergency support, CLBC service providers who provide residential services, such as group homes, can request funding to address overtime costs or staffing shortages and to access additional supplies for delivering disability-related supports to keep individuals safe.People with developmental disabilities who live independently with the help of agency-supported living services have also been identified as vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency funding will support service providers to adjust and continue supports to keep these people safe.Many home-sharing providers are taking on extra caregiving requirements. This is because of the need to follow health guidelines, the disruption to services, such as community inclusion or day programs, and difficulty in acquiring resources that people usually access in their communities. These home-sharing providers will be able to apply for temporary additional funding to ensure people under their care remain supported.In some cases, these residential services are managed through individualized funding arrangements or person-centred societies, rather than service providers. They will also be able to access emergency funding to maintain residential services.As well, the Province has provided $125,000 to VELA Microboard Association of B.C. to enhance its Support Worker Central web platform. Microboards are small groups of family and friends (a minimum of five people) who create a non-profit society to support adults with developmental disabilities. This is an online database designed to match individuals, families and agencies with support workers in their communities.CLBC will work with agencies and launch the process to request funding on April 27, 2020. Funds are available retroactive to April 1, 2020.Quotes:Ross Chilton, CEO, Community Living BC –“I want to recognize the tremendous effort over the last month on the part of service providers to modify services and home-sharing providers to provide the care necessary to keep people safe. It will be reassuring to many families to know that agencies and home-sharing providers will be supported so that they have capacity to respond to needs during these challenging times.”Brenda Gillette, CEO, BC CEO Network –“This funding responds to the needs expressed by community-living service providers in order to safeguard some of B.C.’s most vulnerable citizens. It will ensure we can continue to deliver essential front-line support.”Karla Verschoor, executive director, Inclusion BC –“The last six weeks have reinforced the critical role of the community-living sector in keeping people safe and supported. These emergency funds will allow organizations to continue providing essential services during the coming months. Inclusion BC applauds the government for its support of our member organizations.”Quick Facts:\\nCLBC funds three kinds of residential supports:\\nStaffed residential (group homes): 240 service providers support about 2,700 people living in 900 group homes (which usually house up to four people) throughout B.C. People who choose this option generally need quite a bit of support for daily living. Staff are available throughout the day and night.\\nHome sharing: 470 service providers provide support for about 4,500 home-sharing arrangements, where a person shares a home with an individual, couple or family that is contracted to provide supports for daily living.\\nSupported living: About 2,100 people live independently in their own home and get supports for daily living from about 300 service providers.\\n\\nLearn More:For more information on how to access applications for support through CLBC, visit: https://www.communitylivingbc.ca/emergency-funding/For information and supports that are non-health related, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19, anytime between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time),\\xa0seven days a week.A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe B.C. government invites commercial vehicle drivers, owners and owner/operators in the industry to provide input on proposed changes to modernize safety regulations for commercial vehicles.The Province is proposing changes to Division 37 - Safety Code of the Motor Vehicle Act Regulations to improve road safety:As of June 12, 2021, commercial vehicles that cross provincial borders will be required to be equipped with an electronic logging device (ELD). In response to these changes to the federal Commercial Vehicle Drivers Hours of Service Regulations, B.C. is looking for industry input to help determine what the requirements will be for commercial vehicles operating within the province.National Safety Code (NSC) Standard 13 - Trip Inspections has not yet been adopted by B.C. Currently, under Part 4 of Division 37, many B.C. drivers and carriers are already required to complete trip inspection reports and use pre-printed or electronic reports that mirror the requirements of NSC Standard 13. The adoption of NSC Standard 13 would harmonize B.C. with the rest of Canada and provide clarity for commercial vehicle operators in the province.At the same time, the Province is also seeking industry feedback to inform a decision on mandating the use of speed limiters for commercial vehicles already subject to hours of service.The adoption of speed limiters in B.C. can have benefits, including improvements to safety, fuel savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Quebec and Ontario enacted speed limiter laws over a decade ago. Recent analysis by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has shown the effect on travel times by a lowered travel speed on highways posted over 110 km/h is likely to be minimal, between\\xa0one\\xa0to 13 minutes per corridor.Additional information regarding ELDs, NSC Standard 13 and speed limiters can be found in the following NSC bulletin. It is recommended that the bulletin be reviewed prior to completing the questionnaire: http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/cvse/national_safety_code/bulletins/NSC_Bulletin_02-2020_Modernizing_Safety_Regulations.pdfBefore final decisions are made, it is important to hear from those in the commercial transport industry. The survey is open from April 15 to May 31, 2020. It is available online here: https://feedback.engage.gov.bc.ca/821877\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There has been one new outbreak at the Chartwell Willow long-term care facility in the last day. In total, 20\\xa0long-term care and assisted-living facilities, and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks. Outbreaks have been declared over at six facilities, in addition to the provincial Okanagan Correctional Centre.“There are now\\xa075 cases of COVID-19 associated\\xa0with\\xa0the Mission Institution federal correctional centre.

Anyone who was at the site from March to present is ordered by the provincial health officer to immediately self-isolate for 14 days and contact your primary care provider, 811 or local public-health teams.“The guidance we have in place for work camps clearly outlines how to safely operate, and what should be done in the event of a positive case of COVID-19. It is important that employers and workers continue to follow these guidelines to stay safe.“To date, 1,039 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 104 individuals are currently hospitalized, 49 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Today, the Premier announced a new framework to provide additional support to our rural, remote and Indigenous communities. This framework recognizes and proactively supports communities that may have limited access to the level of health care that we find in larger, urban centres.\\xa0“The framework provides more in-community support and testing, faster access to primary and urgent care, and other important social supports. This will enhance our province’s ability to provide care to all British Columbians and keep our communities safe, as we continue to do all we can to break the chain of transmission.“As the situation within B.C. evolves, our testing strategy evolves with it. Initially, our approach was to understand the source of transmission by testing returning travellers, in addition to using community surveillance testing through our ongoing influenza response.“As\\xa0widespread community transmission occurred, we adjusted our testing to focus on our highest risk and most vulnerable people. This includes outbreaks in long-term care, people who are critically ill and our health-care workers, whose important responsibility it is to care for all of us.“We are now using testing to help us quickly identify and address any new community clusters and outbreaks that may emerge. We want to avoid another spike in new cases and continue to flatten our curve.“What this means is that anyone with COVID-19 symptoms can now be assessed and tested through a physician, nurse practitioner or a local community collection centre.“We remind everyone that while testing is now broadly available, not everyone needs a test. If you have no symptoms, the test has limited benefit.“We are not through the storm. We must remain vigilant to protect loved ones, elders and all of our communities. We will continue to take a slow and thoughtful approach, learning from other jurisdictions that are farther along, while staying alert to changes here in B.C.“We can only introduce modifications to the orders we have in place with further improvement and with all us remaining 100% committed.

       "  \"\\n\\nA new collaborative framework will help ensure people living in rural, remote and Indigenous communities in B.C. have access to critical health care they can count on to meet their unique needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and into the future. \\xa0“People living in rural, remote and Indigenous communities have unique challenges in accessing the health care they need,” said Premier John Horgan. “This new collaborative framework will bring immediate relief to these communities, including a commitment to moving patients to the critical care they need at a moment’s notice. This will help our work to stop the spread of COVID-19, while supporting better health outcomes into the future.”The framework was developed through a partnership between the First Nations Health Authority, Northern Health and Provincial Health Services Authority. The work is guided by the principles of cultural safety and humility, and adds to work underway by the Rural Coordination Centre of BC.The framework provides flexibility so local leaders in rural, remote and Indigenous communities can adapt it to meet their unique needs. It will be implemented through full engagement with each of the communities’ local leaders.\\xa0The framework outlines immediate actions to improve health-care services and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\\nimproved medical transportation options to larger centres, including flight and\\xa0ambulance;\\xa0\\nhousing options for people looking to self-isolate near their families while remaining in their home communities;\\nnew and faster COVID-19 testing technology;\\nculturally safe contact tracing that respects privacy in small communities;\\naccess to Virtual Doctor of the Day, a program that connects First Nations members and their families in remote communities to a doctor or nurse practitioner using videoconferencing;\\noptions for accommodation near larger centres with more medical services; and\\nincreased mental-health supports in communities.\\nLocal leadership will determine how these services operate in their communities, with the priority being to ensure residents can make informed choices about how they receive care.“COVID-19 is a virus that can move extremely quickly and cause a serious decline in health,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “This presents real challenges for rural, remote and Indigenous communities, for whom access to critical care may not always be close to home. We’re working with our partners to make sure people can access the health care they need, no matter where they live in the province.”As part of this initiative, BC Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) has prepared significant additional resources to its fleet. This amounts to an additional 55 ground ambulances throughout the province, including six in Northern Health. In addition, BCEHS has prepared seven fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters for medical transport.\\xa0The faster testing methods underway include GeneXpert test kits, which take less than 45 minutes to complete. Several GeneXpert instruments are in B.C. now and are being used in First Nations Health Authority, Northern Health, Interior Health, Vancouver Coastal Health and\\xa0Fraser Health. A priority was given to more rural and remote sites where the instruments for testing are already in place. More GeneXpert instruments will arrive in the coming weeks.“Indigenous communities have been harder hit in past pandemics and are vulnerable to COVID-19. Elders in particular, as critical knowledge keepers and holders of language, culture and teachings, must be protected,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “Having plans and supports tailored to the unique circumstances and challenges in remote Indigenous communities will support these communities in caring for their residents.”Quotes: Colleen Erickson, board chair, First Nations Health Authority – “This addresses both the urgent short-term responses needed to support communities during the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary long-term upgrades to health-care access for rural First Nations populations.”Charlene Belleau, chairperson, First Nations Health Council –“During the COVID-19 pandemic, B.C. First Nations', especially our remote and isolated First Nations, access to culturally appropriate quality care for our most vulnerable is critical.

First Nations health governance structure is grounded in the wisdom of our Leaders who are determined to address the health inequities within First Nations communities.

       "  \"\\n\\nB.C. students, families and educators are adjusting to a different school life environment during the COVID-19 pandemic.Most students are learning at home. But some children with diverse abilities and students whose parents are essential service workers have greater needs.For B.C.’s education assistants (EAs), the COVID-19 measures have compelled them to find creative and compassionate ways to support students either remotely\\xa0or in person.At D.P. Todd Secondary school in Prince George, education assistants are connecting with students, many of whom have diverse needs and abilities. They connect through online group chats and social-emotional check-ins. The EAs support students’ learning, including reading to them over the phone.“A lot of our students rely on these check-ins,” said Caroline Parker, an EA at D.P. Todd. “When we are in class, you can see their body language change when they've had an opportunity to share what was on their mind, either by being extremely proud of an accomplishment or just letting go of a little bit of stress. This is still even more important today to maintain. They need to know that while so many doors of opportunity are closed right now due to social distancing, that we are still here and do care.”EAs at D.P. Todd are also connecting with classroom teachers to support them in making content more accessible for students who may need an extra layer of support as they learn from home. This might mean recording videos of teachers reading a short story\\xa0or breaking down a math problem.“Our goal is to make sure that all students who were receiving support in the classroom continue to have access to support virtually,” said Rebecca Lund, a support teacher at D.P. Todd, “and that we are supporting teachers to ensure that their continuity of learning is accessible and inclusive to all of our learners.”Parents of students with complex needs have always known the important connection their children have with their EAs. But in these challenging times, staying in contact with EAs is proving to be invaluable to help students continue their learning and establish routines.“My son's two EAs have ensured they have stayed connected virtually,” said Stacy Cockrell, whose son is in kindergarten in Coquitlam. “It has been so astounding, the amount of effort they have put in to ensure he is still learning, engaged\\xa0and also has some sort of connection with them. He lights up when he hears their voices.”Hillary Thompson, a parent in Vancouver, is noticing the positive impact her seven-year-old daughter’s EA is making on her family, with regular online meetings.“It has helped her, and us, feel included at school and motivated to keep learning,” Thompson said. “To be successful, schools and families need to work as a team to navigate this new landscape. For many students with disabilities, educational assistants are a vital part of that team.”In other school districts, EAs are taking on roles unique to the COVID-19 crisis and supervising children in schools, while their parents are on the front lines.\\xa0“As we all know, there are many people in our community doing extraordinary things to achieve a greater good during these challenging and uncertain times,” said Andrea Robertson, an EA at Victoria’s Marigold Elementary school, who is working to provide care and learning opportunities for children of essential service workers. “I feel very proud that I am able to help our Tier 1 health-care providers\\xa0by providing some support that is helpful for them and our community.”Another example of EAs taking on new responsibilities is in the preparation and delivery of nutritious food to families whose children would normally have access to meal programs at schools.Nearly a dozen EAs in the Comox Valley are packing food hampers that will provide nutritious meals to 200 local families during the pandemic. It’s about 11 kilograms (25 pounds) of food in each delivery.“I have truly been impressed by the stories of CUPE members in the K-12 system and how they’re stepping up in these difficult and strange times to make schools safe and inclusive, even at a distance,” said Paul Faoro, president of CUPE BC.Education assistants are vital in school communities and their work will continue and evolve throughout the pandemic. The Ministry of Education is working with all 60 school districts to balance the needs of families, students and communities, and finding solutions to challenges that nobody has faced before.Learn More:Timely information about schools, programs and educational services, including regularly updated frequently asked questions in multiple languages, is available at: www.gov.bc.ca/SafeSchools/For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca\\\\covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.For a French translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.22-NYCU_Education_Assistants_FR.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe Government of B.C. is partnering with the District of Squamish and Squamish Helping Hands Society to provide 49 new temporary homes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in the community.“The need for safe, secure housing has never been more important,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “This partnership with the District of Squamish and Helping Hands Society will make sure people in need have a safe place to call their own during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.”Located at Xwu’nekw Park on Loggers Lane between Victoria Street and Main Street, the development will consist of repurposed modular units that can be put in place within a few weeks. The building will include self-contained bedrooms and shared washrooms. Residents will be provided with two meals a day, delivered to their rooms to support social distancing. There will be at least two staff on site at all times who will offer supports to residents, such as access to addiction and mental-health referrals.The temporary housing is expected to open by mid-May 2020 and will be in place until the end of October when Under One Roof, a new\\xa0permanent shelter and housing\\xa0project, is anticipated to open on Third Avenue. Under One Roof will provide 45 new spaces, including 15 units of low-barrier dormitory housing, 15 units of transitional housing and 15 affordable homes.“In the face of this global pandemic, we must ensure that\\xa0everyone\\xa0in our community can safely distance themselves from others in order to protect themselves and the broader community, and help\\xa0stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Karen Elliott, mayor, District of Squamish. “I am\\xa0very grateful for the quick action of everyone involved to make this project happen. This project will ensure that there are no barriers for residents to access shelter and space to physically distance during COVID-19.”Priority for this new temporary housing will be given to people who are living in the Budget Inn, which is set to be redeveloped, and to people who are experiencing homelessness in Squamish, including those staying at the temporary shelter at the Howe Sound Secondary school’s gymnasium. Once residents move into the temporary housing, the gym will no longer be used as a temporary shelter.“We are\\xa0incredibly\\xa0grateful for the\\xa0amazing\\xa0work\\xa0and leadership\\xa0on this project that will\\xa0offer\\xa0critical support and service to our fellow citizens and our community,\\xa0especially those more vulnerable to this virus,” said Maureen Mackell, executive director, Squamish Helping Hands. “This is a true example of what we can achieve when we come\\xa0together as a community, so that everyone can be\\xa0supported and protected, especially\\xa0in the midst of the current health crisis.”The Province is providing approximately $325,000 to lease the modular units from LandSea, as well as operating funding of more than $152,000. BC Housing will work with Helping Hands Society to develop the operating model. The district is providing the land for this project.In addition to this new project, the Province has also secured a total of 18 rooms across two Squamish hotels that will be reserved for people who do not have a safe place to self-isolate during the pandemic. The locations of the hotels will remain private so staff can focus on helping people in need.Learn More:More information about how BC Housing is supporting British Columbians during the COVID-19 outbreak can be found here:\\xa0https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19Details about how BC Housing is partnering with hotel providers can be found here: https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19/community-sitesFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nPortions of three Vancouver Island highways will be resurfaced this spring and summer as part of an $8.5-million project to improve conditions for people who travel on these routes.Work is underway to resurface a 40-kilometre section of Highway 19 between Parksville and Bowser. Due to reduced traffic volumes as a result of COVID-19, work is happening during the day and overnight with minimal impact on essential travel. Drivers can expect single-lane traffic through the work zone.Near Victoria, Highway 1 will be resurfaced between the new McKenzie Interchange and Leigh Road – a distance of eight kilometres. All on- and off-ramps in the work zone will also be resurfaced. This resurfacing work will happen overnight to minimize delays for drivers.Approximately 2.5 kilometres of Highway 14 near the Westshore Parkway will also be resurfaced. Drivers can expect lane closures during the work. Resurfacing sections of Highway 14 and Highway 1 is expected to begin in spring 2020.A contract for the work has been awarded to Peters Brothers Construction Ltd. of Penticton.The ministry is working closely with the contractor and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO) has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres apart from each other, both in the course of their duties as well as during breaks. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.While highways and roads remain open, the PHO recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.Drivers are reminded to obey construction zone speed limits and the direction of traffic control personnel.

       "  \"\\n\\nMike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, has given police and other enforcement officers the ability to issue $2,000 violation tickets for price gouging and the reselling of medical supplies and other essential goods during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \\xa0Effective immediately, these new measures are enacted under the provincial state of emergency, using the extraordinary powers of the Emergency Program Act (EPA) in ongoing support of the Province’s all-of-society approach to COVID-19 response and recovery.“These orders are not suggestions, they are the law,” said Farnworth. “These measures will provide enforcement officers and police agencies the ability to enforce the law on these criminal acts and despicable practices, like the reselling of medical supplies and price gouging.”The Province is calling upon compliance staff from provincial ministries and local governments to support enforcement for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic state of emergency. This includes municipal bylaw officers, liquor and cannabis inspectors, gaming inspectors, conservation officers, community safety unit inspectors, park rangers, natural resource officers, commercial vehicle safety officials and sheriffs.Police and other enforcement officers are empowered to actively enforce EPA orders and issue $2,000 violation tickets for infractions throughout the COVID-19 state of emergency, focusing on the Province’s ban on reselling essential goods and supplies and price gouging. If required, police and other enforcement officers will also be able to actively enforce and ticket those who:\\nexceed the\\xa0quantity limits on the sale of specified items; and\\ndo not comply with the requirement for hotel and other lodging operators to provide accommodation at the request of the Province to serve as self-isolation facilities or to support essential workers.\\nViolation tickets are a timelier alternative to prosecution through the courts and increase the Province’s enforcement toolkit to support the COVID-19 response. Police and other enforcement officers will independently exercise discretion to issue tickets for EPA order violations under the Offence Act’s Violation Ticket Administration and Fines Regulation (VTAFR).The Province is also working with Consumer Protection BC (CPBC) to keep British Columbians safe from businesses and individuals who are trying to profit from the COVID-19 pandemic. CPBC will be the first and main point of contact for all complaints related to price gouging of essential goods and supplies, and will ensure those complaints are resolved appropriately in co-ordination with police and enforcement officers.These measures are in concert with the federal government’s April 14, 2020, announcement that allows local and provincial police forces to issue tickets to returning travellers who do not comply with the requirement to self-isolate for 14 days under the federal Quarantine Act.Quick Facts:\\nThe federal government will continue to use its authority under the Quarantine Act to ensure compliance with the emergency order requiring individuals entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days.\\nEnforcement of orders of the provincial health officer (PHO), including mass gatherings and business closures, will continue to be at the direction of the PHO.\\nTo report concerns on PHO order violations, contact your local government. Local governments can dispatch bylaw and other compliance officers to follow up on concerns and report appropriately to public health.\\nThe authority for police officers throughout the province to issue $2,000 violation tickets corresponds with section 27(1)(a) and (b) of the EPA and will be applicable under future states of emergency.\\nAll other designated enforcement officers around the province can issue $2,000 violation tickets for contraventions of Section 8 (4) and (5) and Section 9 of Ministerial Order 84/2020, and Section 3 of Ministerial Order 115/2020, under the Emergency Program Act.

       "  'Pandemic modelling is a useful tool, but not a crystal ball',\n",
       "  \"\\n\\nNow that we are well and truly into our COVID-19 pandemic response, many people throughout British Columbia and Canada have similar questions and concerns.How bad is it going to get? How long do we have to be physically distant from others and put aside our regular routines? When can we get back to work, see our loved ones and book social events? I understand the anxiety and frustration that comes with this uncertainty.One of the tools we in B.C., as well as other provinces and the federal government, have used to understand these issues is modelling. In late March,\\xa0British Columbia was the first province to share its modelling.\\xa0We contributed to the national modelling in early April, and have now released our latest report.COVID-19 hit the world like a Category 5 hurricane. The most recent B.C. modelling shows us that in the face of this storm, we have made considerable progress in our province. We have experienced significant damage, but are still standing strong.I want each of you to know that this is for one reason: The immense efforts that you have taken to ‘batten down the hatches’ by being physically distant from others and following the orders and restrictions in place, are truly making a difference.I also want everyone to know that we are in the eye of the hurricane right now, and to fully weather this storm, we must remain 100% committed.The modelling from B.C. and elsewhere clearly shows that if we relax our measures too soon, we will face more severe and unnecessary damage.So how does our modelling help? To begin, we must understand that modelling is not a crystal ball. Instead, it is a useful tool to understand the many situations that we in B.C, as well as people around the world, are in, and the many approaches being taken to flatten the curve. Here in B.C., we also use dynamic modelling to assess what is happening right now, in our province and around the world. This helps guide our decision-making for the future.We are only as strong as our weakest links in society, so modelling also allows us to look over our shoulders at past indicators to see how we’ve done in our attempt to protect people. We can decide what we need to prepare for, and what we can fix right now. Modelling also helps us determine how much longer we need to protect our communities with physical distancing.It is important to understand that all models are inherently imprecise, because they use assumptions that are based on imperfect data, and there is no way for us to know for sure what’s going to happen tomorrow. What we can attempt to see from modelling, though, is how we might influence the curve of a model ourselves, every day, by being extra careful about our physical distancing and other proven measures like cleaning our hands, covering our coughs and staying home when sick.\\xa0In B.C., we are committed to updating our modelling regularly so that everyone can see whether our efforts are successful, day to day, and what our possibilities are compared to other places in the world. We will continue to publish our ongoing epidemiologic curve, case counts and our test-positive rates each day on the BC Centre for Disease Control's website.In our latest presentation, we provided even more data: we have shared the demographics and the epidemiology that tell us who has been affected most by this virus — the age ranges, the locations and various types of epidemiological information — to help everyone get a better picture of who, where and when people in B.C. have been affected.We are being transparent and open with this information because, as I know well, we all need hope and we all want to know how our actions are making a difference.I also want to remind everyone that physically distancing from others does not mean being alone or without aid. Reaching out online and allowing community members to help in these challenging times can make a world of difference.We want everyone to stand united and stay strong. Every British Columbian has a part to play in flattening the curve and making a difference. Let’s all continue together to be safe, be calm, be kind and do the right thing.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 29 new cases for a total of 1,647 cases of COVID-19 in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 686 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 680 are in the Fraser Health region, 97 are in the Island Health region, 150 are in the Interior Health region and 34 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 81 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new outbreaks in the last day. In total, 20 long-term care and assisted-living facilities, and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks. Outbreaks have been declared over at five facilities.“There are now 70 cases of COVID-19 associated\\xa0with\\xa0the Mission Institution federal correctional centre. Fraser Health officials continue to work with Correction Services Canada to manage this outbreak.“To date, 987 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 115 individuals are hospitalized and 54 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“British Columbians have listened to the orders and restrictions. You have shown your compassion and commitment to protecting loved ones, Elders and our health-care workers.“However, we cannot lose sight of the important fact that we continue to have new cases and tragically, new deaths. The hurricane is still raging, and the risk of a spike in our curve is still very much a concern.“The easing of restrictions will be gradual and slow because of the nature of the COVID-19 virus and the up-to-two-week delay in the onset of symptoms. This is why we will be watching the curve closely over the coming week to see what the impacts of the recent holiday weekend may be.“A thoughtful and careful approach will be taken, and only If we continue to see sustained improvement will we be able to introduce modifications. The earliest we would anticipate any changes would be mid-May.“Right now, we must all continue to hold the line. We must all continue to show kindness and care to those around us and do all we can to continue to flatten our curve.”Learn More:The latest modelling presentation and information is available online: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Update_Modelling-BROADCAST.pdfFor information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: http://gov.bc.ca/returningtravellersFor mental-health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\xa0\\nOr: www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts and information on how to protect yourself and your community, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.To use the online COVID-19 self-assessment tool or to download the app, visit: https://bc.thrive.health/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\xa0\\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC\\xa0For a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.18_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdf\\xa0For a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.18_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_FR.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nMore\\xa0than 23,000 computers and devices are being loaned out in every part of the province, so students can access the internet and continue their education while in-class learning is suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic.“Now, more than ever, we must come together to help children and families who are struggling in our communities,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “That’s why we’re working closely with all 60 school districts to quickly provide parents and children with the supports they need to connect with each other, teachers and learning opportunities.”Immediately after spring break, school staff began contacting families to find out their unique needs. School districts then began creating solutions that would work best for their local communities.School districts heard there are families who have no computer for their children to use, with some finding up to 30% of families surveyed had no access to technology at all. There were also cases where there was only one computer in the home being used by a parent for full-time work. Districts also heard from families who have limited Wi-Fi or no access to internet or cellphone service.“Boards of education across British Columbia understand the diverse learning needs of the students they serve,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “Boards of education know that learning solutions need to be tailored to local community needs. These technology loans are one small way boards are working to ensure that the needs of some of our most vulnerable students are met during these uncertain times.”To meet the needs of families, school district staff have worked quickly to identify and collect equipment already available in schools, while also purchasing extra computers, laptops, tablets and other devices. Some school districts have redeployed their computer technicians to pre-install learning software or to provide tech support for families who struggle to use technology.To help kids who do not have adequate internet access, school districts have worked with internet service providers to ensure families have low-cost internet or unlimited cellphone data plans. Local internet hotspots have also been created to ensure free Wi-Fi is available to multiple families in a neighbourhood.In situations where students are living in remote regions with little or no internet or cellphone access, education assistants have been delivering printed learning packages or flash thumb drives with everything the student needs for continued learning at home. Some schools are allowing students access to school computer labs, and some First Nations have opened their band offices for students, while maintaining the strict health and safety standards set by the provincial health officer.\\xa0\\xa0“Parents appreciate the incredible collaboration between K-12 education and the Ministry of Education to ensure educators can shift from in-class learning to remote learning for each child,” said Andrea Sinclair, president, British Columbia Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils (BCCPAC). “BCCPAC believes equity and equal opportunity are essential in public education and maintaining the connection with children is key. Families, especially those who are low income or living in rural and remote regions, must have devices and connectivity so their children can continue learning during this unique time.”\\n\\nTo support families looking for additional resources to help their children learn remotely, the Ministry of Education has created the Keep Learning website, which is updated almost daily with new activities for kids of any age. The website receives hundreds of thousands of visitors and page views every week and can be found at: www.openschool.bc.ca/KeepLearningQuick Facts:\\nIn addition to equipment support, there are approximately:\\n2,300 spaces created in schools to support children of essential-service workers in public schools and 1,280 spaces in independent schools; and\\n75,000 meals delivered to 16,000 families for vulnerable children every week.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education has secured and funded enterprise licences with added security features for the application Zoom for all K-12 public, independent and First Nations schools in the province. This allows consistent access for educators who choose to use it, giving them more ways to connect with students, parents and guardians.\\nLearn More:The Ministry of Education worked with the privacy commissioner to create a set of guidelines for educators when using any online tools: https://www.oipc.bc.ca/guidance-documents/2402Accurate, timely information about schools, programs and educational services, including regularly updated frequently asked questions in multiple languages, is available at: www.gov.bc.ca/SafeSchools \\xa0\\xa0For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The physical distancing measures, staying home if you are ill and following good hand hygiene will continue.

       "  \"\\n\\nNew, free virtual educational programs for students, parents and educators are\\xa0supporting social and emotional well-being as part of navigating the new world of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.“We know that children and families are feeling anxiety and uncertainty during these challenging times, and it’s important we provide resources to help them thrive,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “These new learning tools for students, families and educators offer interactive lessons to support their health and well-being.”The free, virtual WE Well-being program was recently launched as part of the new WE Schools @home program. Accessible for grades K-12 in both English and French, the program is aimed at youth who are experiencing anxiety and social isolation. It places a special emphasis on WE Well-being online learning, including social-emotional learning and resiliency.Developed in collaboration with B.C. educators, the Ministry of Education\\xa0and University of British Columbia and mental health professionals, the program provides educators with curriculum resources for students in elementary schools that cover self-awareness and personal responsibility, with plans to expand to high schools. The program was launched in 2018 as a pilot and has involved over 3,500 students, 150 educators, 43 schools and 11 school districts to date.Also available to parents and caregivers is the new EASE (Everyday Anxiety Strategies for Educators) at Home program. Activities focus on tips and strategies parents can use with their children to create calming routines, help them talk about difficult emotions and manage their anxiety. Kits have been developed for grades\\xa0K-3 and\\xa04-7 and provide five weeks of activities, with a different game or story for each day.\\xa0Activities are research based and proven to help younger children calm themselves, learn relaxation techniques and understand their worries.“This is a difficult time, especially for children and youth who are safely\\xa0distancing from friends and relatives and who may be feeling stressed or anxious from all the recent changes in their lives,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “These new EASE at Home resources will provide parents with simple activities that they can model for their kids and include in daily routines.”The WE Well-being and EASE at Home materials complement\\xa0the recent Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions announcement of $5 million to expand existing mental-health programs and launch new services to support British Columbians around COVID-19. One focus of the funding is a new virtual clinic that will make Foundry services available around the province for young people aged 12 to 24 years and their families through voice, video and chat.“This crisis is taking a toll on the mental health of British Columbians of all ages, including young people and their families,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “This new resource is great news for students who are missing connections with friends and teachers, parents who are adapting to the needs of their children in new ways, and educators who are working hard to support both the academic and emotional well-being of their students.”Quotes:Craig Kielburger, co-founder, WE –“In our isolation, protecting our community’s physical health presents challenges for mental health and well-being. Our goal is to support youth well-being through cost-free digital resources and content that complement distance education with a focus on self care and social-emotional learning. By making these resources easy to use for students, we hope to take some burden off the shoulders of busy parents and teachers.”Kimberly A. Schonert-Reichl, professor, faculty of education, University of British Columbia –“Rarely\\xa0before in our recent history have we seen such an urgent need for an explicit\\xa0and intentional focus on supporting the well-being of our children, their\\xa0families and our educators. B.C.’s Ministry of\\xa0Education is a leader in the world through its steadfast\\xa0attention to mental health in schools and its curricular competencies that integrate\\xa0the promotion of students'\\xa0personal and social\\xa0competence, both which are\\xa0informed from the latest science on well-being. The WE Well-being and\\xa0WE\\xa0Schools @home\\xa0programs provide a perfect\\xa0alignment with B.C.’s focus, because the WE organization has distilled the latest research\\xa0into evidence-based practical\\xa0approaches and resources that integrate social\\xa0and emotional learning and the cultivation of positive human qualities, including\\xa0empathy, gratitude, compassion altruism and resilience – those qualities that\\xa0are\\xa0essential for well-being.”Quick Facts:\\nEarly signs of anxiety can be missed when children struggle with internal worries and physical distress. Some children are at greater risk of developing an anxiety disorder, which affects up to 4% of B.C. children and youth.\\nWE Schools is offered in over 1,160 schools and groups\\xa0in British Columbia, with more than 1,000 schools and 300,000 students engaged.\\nThe WE Schools @home program is connected to the long-standing, free-service learning program WE Schools, which is provided to over 18,000 schools across North America and globally.\\nEASE was developed by the Ministry of Children and Family Development in consultation with Anxiety Canada to be a tangible and practical approach to supporting social and emotional learning and building the capacity of K-7 educators.\\nEASE at Home is also being shared with Indigenous service providers, First Nations Schools Association and the First Nations Education Steering Committee.\\nFor parents with kids who also need the guidance of a mental-health clinician, contact your local Child and Youth Mental Health office for support.\\n\\nLearn More:Learn more about the WE Well-being program:\\xa0https://www.we.org/en-CA/get-doing/activities-and-resources/wellbeing/Learn more about the WE Schools @home program:\\xa0https://www.we.org/en-CA/our-work/we-schools/at-home/EASE at Home offers helpful tips for parents, like how to teach children calming breathing techniques or use structured games like scavenger hunts to build routine in a way that’s fun:\\xa0https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/managing-your-health/mental-health-substance-use/child-teen-mental-health/easeThe Ministry of Education’s Erase strategy was expanded to include mental health: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/eraseFor more information about available child and mental-health supports and contact information, visit:\\xa0https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/managing-your-health/mental-health-substance-use/child-teen-mental-health/mental-health-intake-clinicsThe Ministry of Education’s new Keep Learning site has resources for parents to support positive mental health under the “Keeping Healthy” tab:\\xa0https://www.openschool.bc.ca/keeplearning/\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nIt’s the time of year when bears emerge from their dens and search for food, often bringing them into the nearest community.With more people staying home due to COVID-19 and some waste and recycling services impacted as a result of the pandemic response, it’s more important than ever to be vigilant about keeping bear attractants at bay.Eight communities in B.C. are already setting a strong example of what to do during this extraordinary time. Kamloops, Squamish, Lions Bay, Whistler, Port Alberni, Naramata, New Denver and Coquitlam have had official Bear Smart status for several years through the Bear Smart Community Program. The program is a voluntary, preventative conservation measure that encourages communities, businesses and individuals to work together to reduce conflicts with bears. Several more are actively pursuing the designation.“If bears do not have access to non-natural food sources, such as garbage, fruit and bird seed within communities, they have no reason to hang around. This results in increased safety for both people and bears,” said Mike Badry, provincial wildlife conflict manager, BC Conservation Officer Service. “Residents could turn this unusual time into something positive for wildlife by taking extra time to secure attractants and educate themselves about Bear Smart practices.”Nine years ago, Zoe Kirk,\\xa0a public project works co-ordinator for the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen, and the residents of Naramata started to notice an unsettling trend – an average of four to eight bears were destroyed in the village every year due to ongoing conflicts with people. \\xa0Located on the east side of Okanagan Lake, the community of 2,400 residents consists of fruit farms, large acreages with livestock, a small village centre and tourists flocking to vacation properties during the summer. The area is also home to a healthy population of bears going to and from the lake and fishing in a creek that runs through the village. Unsecured garbage left outside overnight often lured the bruins into the community.“The community is nestled in perfect bear habitat, but some folks were being lackadaisical about attractant management, which put neighbourhoods at risk for a conflict with wildlife,” Kirk said. “Many residents were frustrated by this and began petitioning for a change.”Seeing a need to address the root cause of the conflicts, Naramata signed up for the Bear Smart Community Program in 2012. The program is designed by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, in partnership with the B.C. Conservation Foundation and the Union of B.C. Municipalities, and is based on six criteria that communities must achieve in order to be recognized as “bear smart.”Following that criteria, Naramata put a bylaw in place to prevent residents from putting their garbage on the curb before 5:30 a.m., changed the day of garbage pickup to better align with the days most people were coming or going from the community and provided bear-proof containers in areas that had the most attractants. Then Kirk went to the local schools, getting kids to take home the message that leaving attractants around their home isn’t cool. Garbage audits were also introduced with the support of B.C. conservation officers to educate residents who were found putting out garbage early.Within a year, Kirk noticed a big change in Naramata citizens’ behaviour. Suddenly, there was no garbage on the street and call volumes to the Conservation Officer Service went down from 100 per year to about 12. In 2014, Naramata became the sixth community in the province to be awarded official Bear Smart status – a designation Kirk and village residents continue to view with pride.“People have learned to modify their behaviour and have experienced the difference. In under three years, the community has become almost completely self policing,” Kirk said, who encourages communities struggling with human-wildlife conflicts to sign up for the program. “It takes political will, it takes community will, but when those two come together, you can really make big strides forward.”Last year, the Conservation Officer Service received more than 20,000 calls related to conflicts with bears. Many of the calls pertained to unsecured attractants. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, the Province is reminding citizens to stay safe, healthy and become bear smart. \\xa0Learn More:For more information about the Bear Smart Community Program and the list of criteria to become Bear Smart, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/wildlife/human-wildlife-conflict/staying-safe-around-wildlife/bears/bear-smartTo learn more about the B.C.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Government of British Columbia has launched Here2Talk, a new mental-health counselling and referral service for post-secondary students.The service offers confidential, free single-session services by app, phone or online chat, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.“Until now, post-secondary students have never had access to 24/7 provincewide mental-health support services,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Students advocated for years to fill the gap in available mental-health counselling services in British Columbia. Over the past several months, we’ve been working together to develop this new free service. With the advent of COVID-19 and the increased stress it puts on students, we doubled down to get students the supports they so desperately need. I’m very excited to say that Here2Talk is now available for all 555,000 post-secondary students registered across B.C.”For the first time, every student in B.C. has access to 24/7 mental-health services – whether the students are rural, urban, domestic, Indigenous, international, public, private, full-time, part-time or in trades training. Here2Talk will complement other supports on campus and in the community, including new virtual mental-health supports announced April 9, 2020, by the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions.“For too long, mental-health care was an afterthought in B.C., and many post-secondary students weren’t able to access the help they needed. Here2Talk is changing that,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Now every student can access supports 24/7 without stigma or judgment – and it’s free, because access to mental-health care shouldn’t depend on the size of your bank account.”Chat sessions with a trained counsellor can be accessed by downloading the Here2Talk app or visiting: here2talk.caStudents can speak to a counsellor by phone, toll-free at 1 877 857-3397 or direct 604 642-5212. Students calling from outside Canada can dial 1 604 642-5212 (international calling charges may apply).Hundreds of students throughout B.C. provided feedback and ideas that were used to develop and tailor Here2Talk to deliver the kind of help students felt they needed. The on-demand service, operated by Morneau Shepell, will support students dealing with challenges such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, pressure to perform, crises, racism and relationships. Counsellors will also be equipped to refer students to local resources in their communities.For the launch, web, phone and chat services are currently available in English and French. Phone services are also available in additional languages upon request.Government\\xa0is providing $1.5 million per year for the service.Improving mental health at post-secondary institutions is an integral part of government’s actions outlined in A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making the system of mental-health and addictions care better for people no matter where they live in the province. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Jonny\\xa0Morris, CEO, Canadian Mental Health Association BC –\\xa0“Here2Talk means post-secondary students who need access to mental-health counselling services will have expanded virtual access to help anytime they need it, in a way that makes sense for them. Because it is designed for the post-secondary demographic, it provides targeted support for students at any time when they need to connect. This service stands to increase access to confidential student support provincewide, while linking to existing services on campuses and in community.”Tanysha Klassen, chairperson, BC Federation of Students –\\xa0 “Post-secondary education comes with lots of challenges and stress. This new service, Here2Talk, will help make a real difference in the lives of many students. Even though there are support services on some campuses and in the community, they’re not always easy to access and some students feel uncomfortable asking for help. Here2Talk’s chat, phone and online services will make it much easier for students to reach out for help when they need it.”Norah Joyce, Canada chief commercial officer and executive vice-president, Morneau Shepell –\\xa0 “As the largest and the most fulsome provider of mental-health and well-being services in Canada, including for post-secondary students, we are excited to work with the government of British Columbia on this important partnership. We applaud its leadership in supporting the mental health of every student in this province through this program and are honoured to have been chosen to help provide it, especially now with anxiety related to COVID-19 impacting large sections of the population.”Quick Facts:\\nMorneau\\xa0Shepell administers the largest clinical network in Canada. It has delivered mental-health solutions since 1974 and serviced more than 20,000 organizations worldwide.

COVID-19 Action Plan is focused on the health and safety of British Columbians, direct support for people and businesses and economic recovery for our province. We are providing further support by making additional temporary property tax changes to provide provincewide relief for business and local governments to help weather the pandemic, continue to deliver the services people count on and be part of our province’s economic recovery.”The Province is taking significant new steps to support B.C. businesses, non-profits and other organizations through the COVID-19 pandemic by:\\nfurther reducing the school property tax rate for commercial properties to achieve an average 25% reduction in the total property tax bill for most businesses, providing up to $700 million in relief. This enhances the 50% reduction to the provincial school property tax rate that was originally announced for classes 4, 5, and 6 as part of B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan.\\nPostponing the date that late payment penalties apply for commercial properties in classes 4,5,6,7 and 8 to Oct. 1, 2020, to give businesses and landlords more time to pay their reduced property tax, without penalty.\\nResponding to key concerns from local governments, the Province is addressing cash flow and revenue shortfalls with new measures that provide additional support:\\nauthorizing local governments to borrow, interest-free, from their existing capital reserves to help pay for operating expenses, such as employee salaries.\\ndelaying provincial school tax remittances until the end of the year. This will provide significant relief to local governments facing cash flow issues.\\nproviding local governments greater flexibility to carry debt for an additional year.\\nThese measures will provide local governments with the resources to meet their operational costs and required remittances to regional districts, regional hospital districts, TransLink and transit authorities, BC Assessment, the Municipal Finance Authority and other taxing authorities. This will ensure that other minor taxing authorities can count on receiving the full amount they bill to municipalities and the Province’s surveyor of taxes before Aug. 1, 2020.\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic is having significant financial impacts on all levels of government. It’s going to take hard work from both municipalities and the provincial government, but working together we will get through this,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Many local governments have already shown leadership by taking steps to help people and businesses and maintain services, while addressing their finances. With these new measures, we are giving local governments new tools as a first step to ease their financial burdens and that of businesses in their communities now, and as we look to recovery in the months to come.”Maja Tait, Union of B.C. Municipalities president, said: “Local governments across B.C. are working hard to support the implementation of COVID-19 orders, while ensuring residents have access to the services they need in these challenging times. The measures announced today provide additional relief to small business and will free up funds for local government.\\xa0UBCM will monitor the impact of these measures on the state of local governments finances, and work with the Province to ensure that local governments have the resources to sustain their communities.”Changes to British Columbia’s property tax framework complement federal measures and build on the $5 billion B.C.

Business COVID-19 Support Service will be operated by Small Business BC (SBBC), a non-profit organization that is well known and respected by the business community. The service will act as a one-stop resource to answer questions about supports available to businesses from the provincial and federal governments, industry and community partners.\\xa0“We know that business owners are worried about paying their bills and covering their payrolls, and our government is doing everything we can to help,” said Michelle Mungall, B.C.’s Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “There are multiple programs available, including the B.C. government’s COVID-19 Action Plan, to support businesses through these challenging times. I encourage people in the business community to reach out to Small Business BC to learn more.”Throughout B.C. there are over 500,000 small businesses that contribute significantly to B.C.’s communities and economy. To respond to the needs of these small businesses, and all other businesses around the province, SBBC will offer expanded services.Starting on Thursday, April 16, 2020, advisors are available Monday to Friday, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Pacific time) and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 1 833 254-4357. Inquiries can also be emailed to covid@smallbusinessbc.ca, or raised on the live-chat feature available on SBBC’s dedicated website: https://covid.smallbusinessbc.caSupport is available in multiple languages and a call-back feature will be in place to help manage high call volumes.“The immediate impacts of COVID-19 are being felt by businesses across the province,” said Tom Conway, CEO, Small Business BC. “This new support service will help businesses connect quickly with our existing programs and services, and also learn about the supports being provided by the federal and provincial governments.”SBBC’s dedicated website will include announcements from industry and community partners, as well as a variety of resources, including webinars and practical tools. In addition, SBBC will continue to provide its usual service, like access to expert business advisors, educational services, and free resources in the context of COVID-19.“We’re working closely with businesses and workers across the country to assess and address the impact of COVID-19,” said Melanie Joly, federal Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, and Minister responsible for Western Economic Diversification Canada. “Our message to them is clear: we’re here for you now with concrete measures, like the B.C. Business COVID-19 Support Service, we’ll be here for you in the days and weeks to come and we’ll get through this together.”Support for businesses and their employees is a top priority for both governments. The support service will provide employers with information on resources available that they can share with their staff.“We know that B.C.’s usually thriving tourism industry has been hit hard by COVID-19,” said Lisa Beare, B.C.’s Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “This support service will help B.C.’s tourism sector manage the impacts of this virus and be ready to welcome visitors back to our province, when it is safe to explore B.C. again.”The B.C. Business Covid-19 Support Service is supported by the B.C. government and the Government of Canada through Western Economic Diversification Canada.

We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new long-term care outbreaks in the last day. The 21 affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities have a total of 265 cases of COVID-19.“Fraser Health and the BC Centre for Disease Control continue to provide ongoing support for the outbreak at the\\xa0medium security\\xa0Mission Institution\\xa0(MI)\\xa0federal correctional centre. There are now\\xa048 cases of COVID-19\\xa0associated with\\xa0MI, including seven people from that facility who are receiving care in hospital.“To date, 955 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 131 individuals are currently hospitalized, 59 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We have taken a co-ordinated, provincewide approach to our COVID-19 response to ensure the needs that exist within every community are addressed.“One thing that we all have in common is the understanding that Elders and seniors hold and preserve our history and culture. We also know that they are most vulnerable to COVID-19 and we must do all we can to protect them.“We also recognize that every community in B.C. is unique – with different health-care services and required support. Smaller communities have limited health services, which makes managing and responding to COVID-19 all the more challenging.“This is especially the case for many Indigenous communities and why we have been working to increase options for patient care and clinical support.“While self-isolation at home is preferred by many, it is not always possible. As a result, resources have been created to support Indigenous individuals with alternatives – in urban centres and in local communities.“Localized testing capabilities have been established in the Interior and North to shorten testing turnaround times and reduce the potential for community transmission.”“From the outset of this pandemic, we have adapted our response and added new tools to support British Columbians, and we will continue to do so moving forward. What we do today and every day matters.“Let’s continue to work together, to stay strong and flatten the curve.”Learn More:For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers \\xa0For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\nOr www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts and information on how to protect yourself and your community, visit:\\xa0 http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.To use the online COVID-19 self-assessment tool or to download the app, visit:\\xa0https://bc.thrive.health/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.15_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

While progress has been made, the suffering and loss continue. This has been further compounded by COVID-19.“We are not slowing down or taking our focus off the overdose challenge, but adapting and continuously adding to our response efforts.“Physical distancing does not mean being alone or without help. From the outset, we have said it is critically important to ensure there are also strong social connections in place. The emergency housing options that have been activated ensure people experiencing homelessness can safely self-isolate with care and support.“We want all people who are living with addiction and other major health issues to know that you are not forgotten but are top-of-mind. There is help for those who need it.“There have been incredible sacrifices made and we want you to know that what you are doing today matters. Your individual efforts make a difference in our shared well-being.“To the many public servants who have stepped up to assist returning travellers at our land and air borders; to our health-care workers who are caring for us; to our teachers and educational assistants working in new ways to educate our children; to all British Columbians; and to the many other essential service workers who are helping British Columbians get through this, day by day, thank you for doing your part.”Learn More:For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers \\xa0For mental health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\nOr: www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts and information on how to protect yourself and your community, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. Pacific time, seven days a week.To use the online COVID-19 self-assessment tool or to download the app, visit: https://bc.thrive.health/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nYoutube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.14_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\xa0\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe B.C. government has formally extended the provincial state of emergency, allowing Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, to continue to use extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act to support the Province’s COVID-19 pandemic response.“Through this challenging time, British Columbians are leading the way in our efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Premier John Horgan. “We are starting to see the results of our sacrifice, dedication and hard work, and we must continue to be steadfast in our commitment to keep our communities safe – for ourselves, our loved ones and our workers on the front lines.”The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on April 28, 2020, allowing government to continue to take the necessary steps to keep British Columbians safe.“British Columbians should be proud of the way we have responded to this crisis. But the work is not over,” Farnworth said. “We must hold our ground and take all the steps needed to make sure our communities remain safe and our essential service workers are supported in our ongoing efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19.”Actions taken in the previous two weeks to support British Columbians include:\\nintroducing a new legal requirement to provide a self-isolation plan to support the federal Quarantine Act, and making sure British Columbians returning home from international destinations have the support they need to self-isolate and keep their communities safe from COVID-19;\\npartnering with the Digital Technology Supercluster and the Business Council of British Columbia to create the COVID-19 Supply Hub, a made-in-B.C. online platform to co-ordinate, find and speed up the delivery of medical supplies and personal protective equipment for provincial health authorities to support front-line health workers fighting COVID-19;\\nopening applications for the Province’s new temporary rental supplement, supporting renters who are experiencing a loss of income during the COVID-19 pandemic;\\nannouncing $5 million to expand existing mental-health programs and services and launch new services to ensure British Columbians have increased access to vital mental-health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic;\\nimplementing a series of temporary supports and supplements to ensure B.C.’s most vulnerable – including people on income or disability assistance and low-income seniors – do not encounter additional barriers during the COVID-19 crisis;\\nestablishing an Emergency Relief Support Fund for children and youth with special needs and their families that will provide a direct payment of $225 per month to eligible families over the next three months;\\nissuing new provincial health officer (PHO) guidelines for municipal bylaw officers and other compliance officers to make sure there is compliance with the PHO’s orders and, if necessary, they are enforced consistently throughout B.C. communities; and\\npartnering with local governments, non-profits and the hotel industry to support British Columbians who need a place to self-isolate and to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including people experiencing homelessness, people without safe spaces to self-isolate and youth.\\nActions taken to date build on supports already in place as part of government’s COVID-19 Action Plan, which includes $5 billion in income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency the previous day.The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and physical distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments. The call line is available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. (Pacific time), in 110 languages. People with questions related to their health and COVID-19 should call 811.Quick Facts:\\nDeclarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.\\nThe provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time for\\xa0up to 14 days at a time.\\nDuring the 2017 wildfire season, the province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.\\nLearn More:For information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, including for employers, businesses and schools, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For a French translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.15-NR-State_Of_Emergency_Extended-FR.pdfFor a traditional Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.15-NR-State_of_Emergency_Extended-Traditional_Chinese.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nGovernment has temporarily extended hours of retail liquor service in British Columbia to provide greater opportunities for physical distancing for seniors and people who are immuno-compromised.Liquor retailers, such as wine stores or private liquor stores, throughout the province are now allowed to temporarily operate between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily, if they choose to do so.These time-limited measures should provide seniors and immuno-compromised populations the opportunity to buy liquor during early shopping hours already being provided by other retailers, such as grocery stores.Extending the hours of retail liquor service will support these businesses in complying with the requirements set out by the provincial health officer, the Ministry of Health and other authorities, including those related to physical distancing.The Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB) issued a policy directive that temporarily extends hours of service for licensee retail stores, wine stores, special wine stores and liquor manufacturers with onsite store endorsements, while the Liquor Distribution Branch (LDB) has put into place measures that allow the same operating hours at rural agency stores.Under the temporary directives, delivery services are also authorized to purchase liquor products on behalf of a customer from a liquor store, or any licensee authorized to sell in unopened containers, and to deliver and sell that liquor during these same hours.The new policies are effective immediately and will remain in effect until July 15, 2020. These changes do not override any additional requirements or limitations placed on businesses regarding hours of liquor service by local governments or First Nations.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0 http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBCFor provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week\\n\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

This is why it is crucial that commercial truck drivers have safe and clean facilities.Installation\\xa0of the additional portable toilets began this past weekend, with completion over the coming weeks to provide more options for commercial drivers. Approximately 20 portable toilets have been installed at commercial pull-outs and inspection stations, and the Province will look at adding additional ones in the coming weeks.The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is also keeping all rest areas open during the outbreak to continue to support the trucking industry.\\xa0Maintenance contractors are working to keep these facilities clean, sanitary and well supplied. If people encounter less than ideal conditions at any provincial rest area, they are encouraged to contact the appropriate maintenance contractor or nearest ministry office.In order to make sure everyone in B.C. has access to the goods they need, the Province has created a new Provincial Supply Chain Coordination Unit to assist with co-ordinating the distribution of goods and services. The Province has also launched the COVID-19 Supply Hub, a made-in-B.C. online platform to co-ordinate, find and speed up the delivery of medical supplies and personal protective equipment for provincial health authorities to support front-line health workers.Private industry is also stepping up to provide support for these essential transportation workers. Members of the BC Trucking Association have spearheaded the Meals for Truck Drivers BC pilot, setting up food trucks at various commercial cardlocks throughout the province. Restaurants such as Tim Hortons have reopened many locations along Canadian highways for take-out and restroom use for commercial drivers.Vancouver radio station Red FM has contacted the ministry to fund the installation of additional portable toilets in Surrey and Delta to support the commercial vehicle industry. The ministry is working with Red FM to identify locations and co-ordinate installation this week.The ministry is following the advice and orders of the provincial health officer and the federal government to keep British Columbians as safe as possible and help to stop the spread of COVID-19. While highways and roads remain open, the provincial health officer recommends\\xa0people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.Quick Facts:\\nThere are 203 rest areas in the province, all of which are equipped with toilet facilities. This includes 48 seasonal facilities that are open from early spring to mid-November.\\nThere are also 55 brake checks and 39 chain-up areas to support commercial truck drivers throughout B.C.\\nLearn More: For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. Pacific time, seven days a week.Visit the provincial COVID-19 Supply Hub: www.gov.bc.ca/supplyhubFor a French translation:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Supportfortruckers_French.pdf\\u200b\\xa0For a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/IB-Support_For_Truckers_During_COVID-19-Traditional_Chinese.pdfFor a Punjabi translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/IB-Support_For_Truckers_During_COVID-19-Punjabi.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAll temporary foreign workers (TFWs) arriving in British Columbia for seasonal farm work will be required to self-isolate in government-managed accommodations for 14 days prior to being transported to farms throughout B.C. during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Province will fund hotel and food-service costs during the 14-day self-isolation period – the accommodation will be in the Lower Mainland near the airport and will not be at the farm workplace. The Province is also providing access to socio-economic and cultural supports for workers while they self-isolate.TFWs will need to monitor their conditions during self-isolation – if symptoms like a cough, shortness of breath or fever develop, they will need to call the public health authority or 811.Following 14 days of self-isolation, if no symptoms develop (or once the employee is fully recovered if symptoms do develop), workers will be safely transported to their farm. If TFWs have questions or concerns about their rights, they will be able to contact workplace health and safety offices or employment standards offices.Employers are responsible for paying temporary foreign workers for a minimum 30 hours per week during self-isolation, and at the rate of pay specified on the federal Labour Market Impact Assessment. This is consistent with the TFW program’s genuineness policy, which indicates that reasonable employment needs are a full-time workload (i.e., a minimum of 30 hours per week).TFWs are expected to comply with the orders and recommendations put in place by the provincial health officer as part of the B.C. government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, all farms will need to complete a COVID-19 infection prevention protocol, and be subject to a provincial inspection, before being able to accept temporary foreign workers.Before departing their country of origin, TFWs will be screened by the airline and federal government for COVID-19 symptoms and will not be permitted to travel to Canada until they are asymptomatic.Upon arrival in Canada, TFWs who have travelled to B.C. for seasonal farming work will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms by federal officials (Canadian Border Service Agency and Public Health Agency of Canada). If they have symptoms upon arrival, depending on the severity of their condition, they may be placed in quarantine at the point of entry or be sent to the hospital as per the federal Quarantine Act. If asymptomatic, workers will be sent to a government-managed accommodation to self-isolate for 14 days.Employers with questions should contact AgriServiceBC at 1 888 221-7141 or by email: AgriServiceBC@gov.bc.caQuick Facts:\\nEvery year, approximately 10,000 seasonal farm workers are employed in B.C. through the federal Seasonal Agriculture Worker Program (SAWP).\\nApproximately 1,000 TFWs will arrive\\xa0in British Columbia from Mexico in April to perform seasonal farm work through the SAWP. An additional 2,000 to 3,000 TFWs are expected to arrive in B.C. after April.\\nOn April 13, the federal government announced $50 million to help temporary foreign workers arriving to work in the farming, fishing and food production and processing industries put in place self-isolation measures. It allows TFWs an exemption to travel restrictions to Canada provided they can adhere to the 14-day self-isolation period upon arrival. This will support worker salaries while they are self-isolating for 14 days or housing upgrades to meet requirements.\\nEmployees who have concerns about their rights can call workplace health and safety offices or employment standards offices.\\nCall WorkSafeBC about unsafe or dangerous work or workplace safety at 1 888 621-7233.\\nCall the Employment Standards Branch about problems with pay or hours of work at 1 800 663-3316.\\n\\nLearn More:Information sheet for arriving employees: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/TFW_Farm_Workers.pdfFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, including for employers and businesses, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For common questions about COVID-19 and terminology, visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/common-questions\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  'Statement on anniversary of overdose crisis as public health emergency in B.C.',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nJudy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, has released the following statement in recognition of the fourth anniversary of the declaration of the overdose crisis as a public health emergency in British Columbia:“Four years ago, the overdose crisis was declared a public health emergency. Although we have made important progress and many lives have been saved, there is still an incredible amount of work to do. With the COVID-19 pandemic adding unprecedented challenges, the urgency to protect people who use drugs is greater than ever before.“While the number of overdose deaths declined from 2018 to 2019, there are still countless families reeling from the unfathomable grief of losing a loved one. Now, we are facing a global pandemic on top of a fentanyl-poisoning crisis. People are scared and they feel alone.“That’s why we are working as fast as possible, across government and with all partners, to ensure people living with addiction challenges are supported through both crises.“No one should have to risk their life to get the medication they need. Whether you are visiting a clinic every day for your safe prescription medications, or are reliant on an unpredictable, illegal street-drug supply, following provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry’s orders on physical distancing and self-isolation can feel almost impossible.“That’s why, together with the BC Centre on Substance Use, we recently announced new guidelines so that people can self-isolate to help keep communities safe from COVID-19 and to protect people from overdose, withdrawal or other harms. This guidance is the first of its kind in Canada and outlines how prescribers, patients and pharmacists can now work together to stay safe by delivering medication to patients, using virtual technology for consultations and witnessed injections, and giving patients longer carries of medications.\\xa0“We are providing emergency housing options so people experiencing homelessness and COVID-19 symptoms can self-isolate. We are expanding access to affordable counselling and virtual mental-health care programs. We are providing crisis supplements to people on income or disability assistance and low-income seniors, and have halted evictions during this emergency and introduced a temporary rent supplement.“The opposite of addiction is connection. Most people who die from an overdose die alone – too consumed with shame and blame to reach out for help. As we face the unprecedented challenge of dealing with two public-health emergencies, connection is now more important than ever – but, out of necessity, it looks a little different.“Some of the services that people who use drugs rely on for connection and community, like overdose prevention and supervised consumption sites, are changing the way they operate during the pandemic to protect both staff and clients. We are working with our federal, regional and local partners to ensure people who rely on these essential health-care services can find them – through mobile-outreach teams, virtual check-ins and by removing red tape, so service providers can quickly set up shop at new locations that meet physical distancing requirements.“We are not slowing down. We will continue to take extraordinary measures to keep people safe from COVID-19 and the overdose crisis.“Every single day, I am awed by the dedication, ingenuity and passion of the thousands of people on the front lines of the fentanyl-poisoning crisis in British Columbia. Every day, they continue to work hard to save lives, connect people with treatment and recovery, and build a system of care that understands the root causes of addiction: from unresolved pain and trauma, to health inequities and economic inequality.“Working together, we will continue to challenge the status quo, empathizing with\\xa0– not stigmatizing and ostracizing – people living with addiction. I encourage everyone in B.C. to do the same.“In this unprecedented time of two public health emergencies, we must work together to both flatten the curve and stop overdose deaths. We cannot afford to stop caring about one health-care crisis as we stare down another.”\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe project to widen and upgrade Highway 13 near the Aldergrove-Lynden border crossing has been completed.These improvements are already helping local traffic and commercial vehicles. International travellers will benefit once current travel restrictions are lifted.There are now two northbound travel lanes and three southbound lanes\\xa0on Highway 13 near the Canada-U.S. border between 0 Avenue and 8 Avenue. Northbound, a new lane for slower-moving commercial vehicles will improve traffic flow in the general travel lane. Southbound, a new truck lane and an additional future Nexus lane will improve highway capacity for southbound travellers.The additional lanes on Highway 13 will shorten southbound queues during peak travel times. Combined with a new southbound left turn on 0 Avenue, area residents will have better access, which will improve traffic on local roads. Safety improvements for pedestrians and cyclists were added at 0 Avenue.The project includes a new 3B Avenue east-west connection between Highway 13 and 264 Street, with a traffic signal at Highway 13 to provide safe access. Signals have been added to the existing 8 Avenue intersection to improve safety and traffic operations.The Aldergrove-Lynden crossing on Highway 13 is one of five Canada-U.S. border crossings in the Lower Mainland. Highway 13 becomes State Route 539 south of the border, continuing to Bellingham, Wash. On average, 6,000 vehicles use this section of highway each day in the peak summer season.As part of new measures to support the provincial health officer’s travel orders and reinforce the federal emergency order under the Quarantine Act, British Columbians returning to the country through a B.C. border crossing are required to provide a self-isolation plan.The $25.5-million Highway 13 Widening Project was cost-shared by the Government of Canada and Province of B.C.Learn More:Information on the requirement for a self-isolation plan for international travellers upon arrival to B.C. is available online: http://ow.ly/abAX50z9ijVTravel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNTFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: \\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAs we celebrate Education Week 2020, there’s never been a better time to shine a bright light on the extraordinary work being done throughout our province right now to ensure B.C. kids keep learning.It’s only been a little over three weeks since our government made the difficult decision to suspend in-class learning to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and one week since most school districts returned from spring break. In this short period of time, we have seen B.C.’s education professionals meeting each new day with tremendous innovation, teamwork and perseverance.Over spring break, government worked with all our education partners to develop a common set of teaching, and health and safety, guidelines to ensure education continues to be inclusive, while being safely delivered across all 60 of our school districts.Immediately after spring break, school leaders began connecting with families in their communities to determine the number of essential service workers who need child care so their parents can continue to serve on the front lines of the COVID-19 response.\\xa0They were also checking in with students who need a meal program, a computer loan, internet access, learning resources mailed or dropped off to\\xa0their homes, mental health or one-on-one tutoring support. \\xa0\\xa0As educators began personally connecting with students and delivering lesson plans by phone or online, they took their creativity and compassion to a whole new level. There have been so many amazingly innovative ways educators are supporting students to help them stay engaged in the curriculum from home, while ensuring vulnerable students are supported with customized resources. Indigenous teachers are hosting daily K-8 lessons and reading groups online to ensure culturally relevant content is easily accessible for every child in the province. Phys-ed teachers are leading exercise programs to keep kids moving while they’re at home.Support staff are going above and beyond to deliver learning packages or meals to family homes, and bus drivers have stepped up to make sure schools are clean for those who need to be there. Many schools and even some students have started to use their 3D printers to create safety equipment for health workers. Others are organizing the donation of food and supplies, refurbishing laptops or creating local internet hotspots for kids who need the extra support.\\xa0\\xa0These are tremendous efforts, and I’m only highlighting a few of the hundreds of inspiring stories we’ve heard about. \\xa0It also speaks volumes about the dedication of parents and guardians in our province that we’re continuing to see great success with the Keep Learning website, which has been updated almost daily with new device-free activities for kids of any age. We are seeing hundreds of thousands of visitors and page views every week to this page: www.openschool.bc.ca/KeepLearning/British Columbian families are pulling together, being flexible, being patient and making things work to help children learn remotely. \\xa0We are navigating this new terrain together and we must do our best to support each other’s health and well-being. Every British Columbian has a part to play to flatten the curve.\\xa0Know that these actions are temporary, and we will return to regular school life down the road. In the meantime, we are committed to keeping communication open with families through this website: www.gov.bc.ca/safeschools/This is where families can find constantly updated FAQs, the latest news releases and information bulletins, available in seven languages.We are so fortunate to have devoted teachers, support staff, principals and vice-principals, trustees and superintendents working collaboratively in our K-12 education system, so our more than 600,000 students can continue learning.This Education Week, I encourage you to share your appreciation to the education professionals who are making a difference in the lives of B.C. children during these unprecedented times.By working together and supporting each other, we will get through this.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Normally in B.C., this day would be celebrated through worship in the Gurdwaras and big, colourful parades in the streets of communities all over British Columbia. Friends and families would come together to eat, dance and sing.“This year, Vaisakhi events will look different. People will find new ways to celebrate and connect with each other – by video chat, phone or visiting from a safe physical distance. I know spending this day apart from loved ones is very hard. I will miss walking in the vibrant Vaisakhi parades and experiencing the generosity and kindness of the Sikh community. But, now more than ever, we must do everything we can to keep ourselves and others healthy and safe.“The Sikh community has always shown compassion and generosity to those who are struggling. Now, when people around the province are dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, the community is providing free meals to low-income families, supporting seniors in isolation and raising money for workers who have been laid off.“I would also like to acknowledge the national blood drive campaign that the Sikh community is holding with Canadian Blood Services to help save lives. I am deeply grateful for this selfless community service.“Today, and through Sikh Heritage Month, I wish health and happiness to the Sikh community and to all British Columbians celebrating this day.“Vaisakhi Diyan Lakh Lakh Vadhaiyan!”For a Punjabi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STM_PJH_Punjabi.pdfFor a Hindi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STM_PJH_Hindi.pdfFor a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STM_PJH_FR.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Today, we’re stepping up to support their efforts.”As\\xa0a first step to support the music industry, the B.C. government is partnering with Creative BC to launch Showcase BC. This new online hub brings a variety of live performances, entertainment and content\\xa0to British Columbians, so they can stay connected while staying home.To help B.C. musicians take part in Showcase BC, Creative BC has also opened a new Showcase BC music funding stream. This new program will provide one-time micro-grants of $500 to emerging artists and $2,000 to established artists for livestreaming, songwriting and professional development. Creative BC will offer grants to all previously eligible Amplify BC applicants. British Columbians can access all the grant performances for free through the Showcase BC website and get information on new livestream events by following the hashtag #ShowcaseBC on Twitter.To bring people together, the Province will host a free livestream concert next week featuring musicians from around British Columbia. People will be able to join in and watch the concert online. The concert lineup will be announced soon.Quotes:Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission –“What I've heard from people in the music industry is that live-music venue closures have had a profound and immediate impact on their ability to make a living. I am thrilled that these supports will not only help musicians but will also bring music and joy to people's homes until we can all attend concerts in our communities again.”Prem Gill, CEO, Creative BC –“This program is designed as a quick response by Creative BC to the immediate needs of artists across the province’s music industry. It helps them create, stream and generate revenue, with Showcase BC bringing all of that dynamic content direct to our homes while we do our part to stay home, safe and connected.”Dan Mangan, musician and creator of Side Door –“I think most musicians are doing what they can to lift people’s spirits right now. I’ve been playing interactive online shows each Saturday via Side Door. Getting access to funding to keep the artistic community afloat makes all the difference to me and my peers.”Learn More:Watch livestreaming content from B.C. artists at:\\xa0https://showcasebc.ca\\nFind information about new livestreaming events by following #ShowcaseBC on Twitter.For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nFrom the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have regularly seen people choose to wear a variety of masks, from medical masks to cloth face coverings, in grocery stores and parks, on buses and sidewalks.As we all look to protect our loved ones and ourselves, many have asked if this is the right thing to do.What we know about the virus that causes COVID-19 is that it spreads from droplets when people who are infected with the virus cough, sneeze or expel droplets when they are in close contact (within one to two metres) with others. This is why physical distancing is so important and why self-isolation is necessary when we are ill or have recently travelled. This is also why washing our hands, covering our mouths when we cough, and not touching our face or eyes are the best actions we, as individuals, can take during the pandemic.Equally important is the need to reserve medical masks and N95 respirators for our health-care-workers. It is their job to care for us when we are ill and having the correct protective equipment to do that is crucial for them and for all of us.So how do non-medical cloth masks fit in? The Canadian public health special advisory committee has closely reviewed evidence from around the world to answer this question. We now know that some people can spread the virus when they have very mild symptoms or may be unaware they are infected.As Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, has explained, a non-medical cloth mask or face covering can help you keep your own droplets out of the air and off surfaces. Choosing to wear such a face covering is like coughing or sneezing into a tissue or your sleeve.A non-medical cloth mask or face covering, while helpful in containing your own droplets, will not protect you from COVID-19, nor is wearing one required of you if you can keep your safe distance from others. Moreover, using a cloth mask does not give you permission to disregard physical distancing and self-isolation orders. Indeed, these, along with respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene, remain the key proven measures to stop transmission.Wearing a cloth mask or face covering is a matter of personal choice. It is another tool you can choose, particularly when maintaining that important safe distance can be a challenge.Our most important advice remains the same: if you are sick, you should stay home. Wearing a cloth mask may contain your virus droplets, but it does not make it okay to go out. Maintain a safe distance from others when you are out, clean your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.I applaud the creativity and ingenuity of many who have taken the time to make these cloth masks and it is encouraging to see the social connections that have been made by sharing patterns and creative ideas online.If you choose to wear a non-medical cloth mask or face covering, I remind you of the importance of continuing to not touch your face when wearing it. This is often challenging especially for small children, and of course, be cautious when removing the cloth mask. Wash it regularly and do not share it with others.We want everyone to stand united and stay strong. Every British Columbian has a part to play in flattening the curve. Let’s all be safe, be calm, be kind and do the right thing.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.For a Punjabi translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/OpEd_PHO_Punjabi.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

As announced on March 25, 2020, the Province has halted evictions during the COVID-19 crisis.To support renters who are facing a loss of income during the pandemic, a new Temporary Rental Supplement (TRS) offers up to $500 a month to help renters pay part of their rent and help ensure landlords continue to receive at least some rental income right now.\\xa0Qualified tenants will be able to receive supplemental rent support for the months of April, May and June 2020. Full eligibility criteria and application forms for the rental supplement are available online: http://bchousing.org/bctrsThis supplement is in addition to funding available from the federal government and the $1,000 B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers.There are also existing permanent programs available for seniors (Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters) and for low-income families\\xa0(Rental Assistance Program).\\nMore information on these programs is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/rental-assistance\\xa0\\nIn response to the challenges posed by the current crisis, there are also programs available from the federal government online: https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.htmlWhile the rental supplement is designed to help renters pay their rent during this emergency, renters will be responsible for any outstanding rent owing after the state of emergency has ended.Renters who are not experiencing financial hardship should still pay their rent. Tenants who are able to make even a partial rent payment are encouraged to do so.The people providing rental housing rely on rent payments to pay for their utilities, mortgages and other bills related to the rental property. If renters are unable to pay the full rent or need more time, they are encouraged to inform their landlord and to apply for the supplement and other support programs.To protect both renters and landlords during this time, the Province has frozen rent increases for existing tenants, allowed landlords to restrict the use of common areas by tenants or guests to protect against the transmission of COVID-19, and given renters the right to control who enters their units, except in emergency circumstances. These measures and others are outlined in the March 25, 2020, announcement: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0048-000561Renters and landlords are encouraged to do their best to come to mutual solutions during the pandemic.

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian\\xa0Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We\\xa0are announcing 34 new cases, for a total of 1,370 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 626 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 508 are in the Fraser Health region, 82 are in the Island Health region, 130 are in the Interior Health region and 24 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report two new COVID-19 related deaths, one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and one in Fraser Health region, for a total of 50 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new long-term care outbreaks in the last day, and the outbreak at Villa Cathay facility has been declared over. Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health teams continue to provide support to the 20 remaining affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 235 cases of COVID-19.“To date, 858 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 132 individuals are currently hospitalized, 68 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“To flatten the curve, we must ensure our health system is robust and fully able to address the unparalleled challenges of COVID-19. We\\xa0must also take care of our front-line workers so they can care for us, protect and support our most vulnerable, and do all we can to keep our firewall strong.“This is a challenging time for all of us – physically, emotionally and mentally – especially when our meaningful connections are virtual connections. There are many resources available and, as the Province announced today, more are on the way. If you are struggling and need help, please reach out.“This holiday weekend is not the time for travel, unless absolutely necessary. Rather, let’s make it an ‘unwind and be kind’ weekend at home. There are lots of things we can do to relax, have fun and connect with family, friends and our local community at a safe distance.“Residents at long-term care and assisted-living homes are very vulnerable to COVID-19. One of the most important things we can do to protect them, and those caring for them, is to make it possible for workers to provide services at a single facility, reducing the risk of virus transmission between facilities.“Using orders under the Public Health and Emergency Programs acts, we have implemented a process to support workers to work at a single facility. This includes development of a new labour agreement that ensures all workers – at health authority, non-profit and private facilities – receive an equitable wage and work-hours scheduling stability so they can work at a single site without disrupting services for residents.“Long-term care and assisted living care-giving and support staff are responding courageously to monumental challenges during this unprecedented time, and deserve our respect and support.”Learn More:To view the new single-site orders, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor all provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor the Joint Statement by the Ministers of Health for British Columbia and Alberta, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0127-000665To learn more about new mental health and anxiety supports announced today, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MMHA0009-000655For more information about connecting virtually with loved ones over the long weekend, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PSSG0019-000671For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0 http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nOn Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\nOn Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nOn Youtube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_2020.04.09_CN.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nEver wonder what everyone was\\xa0doing with all the toilet paper they bought last month?Physical education (PE) teachers in North Vancouver used the bathroom staple to help encourage their students to keep active during the COVID-19 pandemic.Argyle Secondary school’s PE teachers recorded themselves making creative, funny and active use of a single roll of toilet paper. Examples included trick shots, catching a roll with a fly-fishing rod and using a roll as a football with family. The teachers uploaded the video on Youtube\\xa0and then challenged students to come up with their own ways to use a toilet paper roll to stay active. The teachers say this is the start of weekly video challenges that serve a number of learning purposes. The toilet paper will eventually be used for its intended purpose once the challenge is complete. To view the video, visit: https://youtu.be/c0TP0QiveOU“Students are going through a difficult, uncertain time right now,” said Bryan Lockless, one of Argyle’s teachers. “We, as a PE department, wanted to do something fun to inspire them to be creative, show their learning in new ways, keep connected and have fun with the online physical education challenges we have put together for them.“We can’t wait to see what the students come up with on a weekly basis.”This is one of many examples of leaders in B.C.’s schools coming up with new, innovative and creative ways to reach students while in-person classes are suspended.In New Westminster, students are the stars in an uplifting video. Amy Bothwell, a Grade 5 teacher at Qayqayt Elementary school, wanted to help her students think of new ways to support their communities while in-class learning is suspended.She asked her students to take a picture, or film themselves, doing something that helped others\\xa0and put together a compilation of everything her students came up with. That video can be seen at: https://spark.adobe.com/video/uKTUUqFwQPViq?fbclid=IwAR26ctBkbSdJ1nheofYE0CKlwO_xjDbX_QVO3tiepvbiQQjeP4Q8XFXbLcw“The students really just took it and ran with it,” Bothwell said. “From putting art in their windows supporting health care workers, to playing songs on a trombone, it really gave the students a sense of community and a sense of connection.“The students were really excited to see their friends again, even if it was just in a video.”The digital world is proving to be a great place for learning and connection. The Ministry of Education has developed a website for parents to support children, Keep Learning BC, and is providing a number of licensed web platforms, including the Zoom collaboration tool, to school districts to help keep school communities connected.

       "  \"\\n\\nOver the Easter long weekend, British Columbians are asked to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by avoiding all non-essential travel, staying home and finding virtual ways to connect and celebrate with family and friends.Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO), has indicated that the next few weeks are critical in managing this pandemic, so it’s more important than ever to continue to follow public health guidelines and practise physical distancing to prevent further spread. Though the long weekend is normally a time when people go out for recreation, celebration and connection, the provincial health officer is urging British Columbians to stay home to help flatten the curve.Here is some important information and tips that can help British Columbians ensure that everyone can enjoy the long weekend, while following the public safety guidelines set by the provincial health officer.Follow public health orders and guidelinesBritish Columbians are asked to continue to maintain physical distancing, as well as take these other important measures to limit the spread of COVID-19:\\nStay home for at least 10 days if you have any symptoms of illness. After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you feel better, you can return to your routine activities. Coughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.\\nStay at least two metres (over six feet) away from other people outside your household.\\nWash your hands frequently with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds.\\nAvoid touching your face.\\nBritish Columbians who are returning from abroad need to prepare a self-isolation plan before returning to the country to keep our communities safe. Guidance for those returning from international destinations is available here: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Factsheet_Returning_Travelers.pdf\\nAnyone who has friends or family members who are coming home from abroad are encouraged to help\\xa0them understand the new rules related to COVID-19. Guidance for families of those returning home is available here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Factsheet_Returning_Family.pdf\\n\\xa0More information for returning travellers is available here: www.gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers\\nSafely mark holidays and religious observancesAt this time, the PHO is reminding everyone to continue practising physical distancing, avoid large gatherings and stay away from others if ill. That includes religious and other celebratory gatherings that typical take place during this long weekend for Easter, Passover and Vaisakhi.Many faith-based organizations are finding ways to virtually connect to continue to observe occasions in a safe way. Or, look for creative and innovative ways to safely observe the holiday by attending virtual services or using FaceTime, Zoom or Skype to stay in touch with other members of your community.Guidelines for faith-based gatherings are available here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/covid-19/covid-19-pho-guidance-faith-based-organizations.pdfAvoid non-essential travel and recreationThe transportation network is essential for maintaining the critical supply chain for food, goods and medicine, and ensuring people have access to essential goods and services. There are currently no plans to shut down any of B.C.’s public roads, but now is not the time to travel for tourism or recreation. By temporarily avoiding non-essential travel, British Columbians can do their part to protect vulnerable people in communities from COVID-19.Things to keep in mind over this long weekend include:Don’t visit vacation properties\\nThis is not the time to travel to secondary homes or vacation properties in other communities. It’s not only important stay home and maintain physical distancing, but access to resources and health care may be more challenging in smaller communities if someone should become ill or if there’s a community outbreak. By staying home, British Columbians can take pressure off the already strained resources in these smaller areas.\\nBC Parks are closed\\nFinding ways to maintain safe distances has been an ongoing challenge in some of B.C.’s more popular parks and recreation sites. This is why BC Parks has announced an immediate closure of all provincial parks. Also closed are all federal parks, as well as campgrounds and amenities run by B.C.’s Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. Parks will reopen as soon as the provincial health officer indicates it’s safe to do so.\\xa0\\nKeep search and rescue volunteers safe\\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, there is higher risk for B.C.’s 2,500 search-and-rescue volunteers, as there is a risk of virus transmission during a call to help those who have been lost, stranded or injured in B.C.’s outdoors. With more people staying home, search and rescue calls have dropped by 50%. However, British Columbians are asked to do their part and not to venture into the wilderness at this time.\\nThings you can do close to homeVirtual visits\\nInstead of visiting families and friends in person, look for creative and innovative ways to safely connect with friends and family, such as virtual coffee dates and using FaceTime, Zoom or Skype to stay in touch.\\nSafe recreation\\nGetting outside for fresh air and exercise is important – so long as family can keep a safe distance of at least two metres from others outside their household.\\nSome parks and beaches have closed because they’re too busy. There are many other quieter outdoor spaces to enjoy, so long as everyone can keep a safe physical distance.\\nBeing outdoors, walking pets and physical activities, such as going for a bike ride are all safe, so long as a safe physical distance is maintained.\\nHelp elderly or vulnerable neighbours\\nThe\\xa0PHO is encouraging people to be kind and support each other as much as possible.\\nElderly or vulnerable people may need assistance collecting groceries or prescriptions.\\nNeed help? Call 211, a B.C. service that matches seniors with volunteers during the pandemic.\\nSpring clean but keep donations for now\\nWith everyone staying at home, it’s a great time to do some spring cleaning.\\nHowever, with the current physical distancing orders in place, most charities are not currently picking up goods from their donation bins right now.\\nFor now, hold onto your donations. Please don’t leave them around the donation bins.\\nProtect your home from floods and wildfire\\nBritish Columbians should make sure they are prepared for all emergencies, and this time at home is a good opportunity to reduce flood and wildfire risks.\\nTake time to clean gutters, maintain perimeter drains, clear storm drains of debris, ensure waterspouts are away from residences, and complete some simple landscaping to manage run-off.\\nMake sure to thin and trim trees, shrubs and other vegetation, and remove dead brush and other flammable material from the property. Also, make sure to use fire-resistant building and landscaping materials.\\nLearn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: \\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on TwitterFor additional mental health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MMHA0009-000655For the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.Any change to provincial park access or services will be posted to the BC Parks website: http://bcparks.caFor status updates on RSTBC campgrounds, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/sports-culture/recreation/camping-hiking/sites-trailsFireSmart homeowner’s manual was developed to help reduce the risk of personal property damage due to wildfires.

Nous aidons les Britanno-Colombiens à traverser cette crise en freinant les évictions afin que les locataires ne perdent pas leur logement. Nous les aiderons à payer leur loyer grâce à un nouveau supplément temporaire, qui assurera une aide financière directe pour la dépense mensuelle la plus importante pour la plupart des ménages, a déclaré Selina\\xa0Robinson, ministre des Affaires municipales et du Logement. Cette mesure, ajoutée aux programmes provinciaux et fédéraux déjà offerts, offrira aux citoyens le soutien financier dont ils ont besoin de manière immédiate.\\u2009»Ce programme permettra aux ménages admissibles de recevoir une prestation de 300\\xa0$\\xa0ou de 500\\xa0$ par mois, selon qu’ils comptent ou non des personnes à charge. Les colocataires admissibles seront en mesure de demander ce supplément individuellement.\\xa0\\xa0Le supplément pour le paiement du loyer est disponible à raison d’une prestation par ménage répondant aux critères suivants\\xa0:\\nêtre prestataire ou admissible à l’assurance-emploi ou à la Prestation canadienne d’urgence, ou avoir subi une diminution du revenu d’emploi de 25\\xa0% sur un mois en raison de la crise de la COVID-19;\\navoir un revenu annuel de moins de 74\\u2009150\\xa0$ ou de 113\\u2009040\\xa0$ pour l’ensemble du ménage, selon qu’il compte ou non des personnes à charge;\\nconsacrer plus de 30\\xa0% de son revenu brut actuel ou réduit au paiement du loyer;\\xa0\\nne pas recevoir d’autres subventions pour le paiement du loyer de quelque autre palier de gouvernement que ce soit, qu’il s’agisse d’un logement subventionné ou de prestations pour le paiement du loyer comme le Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) ou le Rental Assistance Program (RAP).\\nLe nouveau supplément sera offert pour les mois d’avril, mai ou juin 2020. Les locataires admissibles au programme et qui ont déjà payé le loyer d’avril seront toujours en mesure de recevoir une prestation pour ce mois.Ce supplément sera versé directement aux propriétaires au nom des locataires afin de réduire le montant que ceux-ci auront à payer et de faire en sorte que les propriétaires obtiennent un revenu locatif sans délai.

       "  '\\n\\nTo ensure British Columbians have increased access to vital mental health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Province has announced\\xa0$5 million to expand existing mental health programs and services and launch new services to support British Columbians.\\xa0“If you are feeling anxious, stressed, depressed or disconnected because of COVID-19, I want you to know that you are not alone,” said Premier John Horgan. “Our government is working to give you more options for mental health support\\xa0as we all stay home to prevent the spread of this virus.”Enhanced virtual services will help all British Columbians with mental health needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on adults, youth and front-line health care workers. The funding will also increase access for Indigenous communities and those living in rural and remote parts of the province. It will provide more options for people living with mental health challenges who are currently unable to access in-person supports.“I have heard from people right across B.C. about how this pandemic is taking a toll on their mental health,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Whether longstanding challenges are flaring up or you’re struggling with your mental health for the first time – we’re here for you. We’re working quickly to expand virtual mental health services to ensure that when you reach out for support, someone will be there to help.”The\\xa0Province is working in partnership with Foundry Youth Centres, the Canadian Mental Health Association – BC Division (CMHA-BC), the BC Psychological Association and other community partners to deliver new and expanded mental health services. These include:\\nproviding\\xa0more access to online programs for mental health by expanding the BounceBack program. BounceBack provides online coaching and the Living Life to the Full program, which helps people deal with life challenges and learn self-management skills (CMHA-BC);\\nexpanding access to no- and low-cost community counselling programs, including those that serve immigrant and refugee populations, and enabling them to be delivered virtually;\\nincreasing access to online peer support and system navigation (CMHA-BC);\\nproviding virtual supports for youth aged 12 to 24 by making Foundry services available around the province through voice, video and\\xa0chat (FoundryBC);\\nproviding more online tools and resources to help people assess and manage their own mental health;\\nsupporting front-line health-care workers through a new online hub and providing virtual peer support (CMHA-BC); and\\na new online psychological support service for health-care workers (BC Psychological Association).\\nExisting services are being scaled up rapidly to meet increased need while new services are being implemented. Several services are available and online, while others will come online April 20, 2020. See the backgrounder below for details.The emphasis on virtual support and care will be offered in multiple languages, as well as connect people living in rural and remote communities and Indigenous peoples throughout the province. The Province will continue to collaborate with Indigenous partners to ensure these services are culturally safe and responsive to the needs of Indigenous peoples in rural and urban areas.This funding is in addition to\\xa0a co-ordinated effort across government to bolster virtual mental health services for children, youth and students related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Quotes:Jonny Morris, CEO, CMHA-BC –“The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound impacts on the mental health of British Columbians, with increased reports of stress, worry, depression, anxiety and loss. This investment will help the CMHA and our partners respond to the growing mental health impacts of COVID-19 through increased access to warm, compassionate and skilled virtual care. It is critical that expanded access to mental health and substance use care is part of the ongoing response to COVID-19. Now, more than ever, we need these mental health supports to reach people, even while we remain physically apart.”Dr. Steve Mathias, executive director, Foundry –“At this unprecedented time, it is even more important for youth and families across B.C. to know where to find the supports and services they need. With the support of the provincial government and our nine Foundry centres, Foundry is moving our services online, starting with drop-in counselling, and then peer support services and physical health care. We’re pleased to be able to provide these services virtually so that young people and families in all corners of the province can get the help they need, when they need it.”\\n\\nLesley D Lutes, director of clinical training, department of psychology, University of British Columbia (UBC) Okanagan; director of public advocacy, British Columbia Psychological Association –“On behalf of my colleagues at UBC Okanagan and the BC Psychological Association, we will work tirelessly on this initiative, not only to support direct patient care, but to provide training and support to our mental health colleagues and the next generation of psychologists. We are eager to assist in evaluating new and extended services to ensure that they are both evidence based and delivered to the highest possible level of care. We look forward to developing a meaningful partnership with the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, and I want to thank Minister Darcy for her support thus far. Whether it’s mental or physical health, I’m pleased that we are all coming together to put the health and well-being of British Columbians first.”Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\xa0\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new long-term care facility outbreaks in the last day. Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health teams continue to provide support to the affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 226 cases of COVID-19.“To date, 838 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 135 individuals are hospitalized and 61 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Flattening the curve is about following the orders and restrictions in place, and equally important, supporting others to make it easy for them to do the same.“Right now, it is critical to stay strong in our commitment to protect our province. We cannot allow for gaps that could set back all the positive efforts we have made so far.“The new requirement for returning travellers to have an approved self-isolation plan is one more tool to help make that happen.“We thank the many volunteer organizations and public servants who have stepped up to enable this important action. Teams will be connecting with travellers at borders and while self-isolating to ensure they have the necessary support that may be required.“All of us need to avoid unnecessary travel, particularly to smaller communities where there are fewer health resources. While many of us have family and friends in Alberta, we must not travel to visit them this long weekend. We need to make the choice to protect our friends and family by staying home and finding virtual ways to connect.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Province is introducing new measures to make sure British Columbians returning home from international destinations have the support they need to self-isolate and keep their communities safe from COVID-19.The measures, which include a new legal requirement to provide a self-isolation plan, support the provincial health officer’s travel orders and reinforce the federal emergency order under the Quarantine Act requiring people entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days.“As we welcome British Columbians back home, we must stay vigilant and do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Premier John Horgan. “As we follow the advice and guidance of our provincial health officer, it’s also important to take care of one another. By supporting people through a self-isolation plan after international travel, we will keep people safe and help flatten the curve.”Effective immediately, international travellers (including from the United States) coming to the province are required to provide a self-isolation plan before or upon arrival to B.C., regardless of their point of entry to Canada.This document, which can be submitted online or completed in person on arrival, must show that returning travellers have supports in place to safely self-isolate for 14 days.Beginning\\xa0Friday, April 10, 2020, provincial officials will be on hand at the Vancouver International Airport and major land border crossings to make sure self-isolation plans are complete and to assist those who need it.Upon border arrival, self-isolation plans will be reviewed by officials, and travellers will be supported as follows:\\nIf a self-isolation plan is submitted and approved, travellers will receive a confirmation. This confirmation can be shown on arrival. Travellers with approved plans will proceed to their home residence (or another identified accommodation) to self-isolate.\\nIf\\xa0an airline traveller arrives and an adequate self-isolation plan is proposed but needs additional support to execute safely (e.g., enlist volunteers to deliver groceries or fill prescriptions once at home), travellers may be taken or directed to an accommodation site provided in collaboration with the provincial and federal governments to begin self-isolation, while outstanding details of their plan are put in place. With an approved self-isolation plan, they may return home.

       "  \"\\n\\nBook lovers of all ages will soon have greater access to online learning and reading resources, thanks to a one-time $3-million government investment in public libraries.“It’s important that people have access to digital literacy programs, ebooks and online learning,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “I am proud to see the innovative ways our libraries continue to support and connect people who want to learn, explore and be entertained through digital resources. This funding will help bring libraries into the homes of families throughout the province.”Libraries can use this new funding to provide enhanced digital and connectivity services by expanding Wi-Fi capabilities, offering community digital literacy training, enhancing online library programs and purchasing technology, such as scanners, tablets, microphones and cameras. Libraries will work together to deliver a provincewide collection of ebooks, magazines and other online services that people will be able to access with their library card.Part of these funds, $1.8 million, will be allocated through the BC Libraries Co-operative to support electronic resource\\xa0licensing and help expand online common collections for all B.C. public libraries. The additional $1.2 million will be distributed directly to libraries.The ministry has released a new strategic plan for provincial public library services in British Columbia. The plan was developed with library partners and focuses on making sure British Columbians experience library services that are engaging, accessible and responsive to their needs.“Public libraries are an important part our government’s plan to make life better and more affordable for British Columbians of all ages,” Fleming said. “Libraries improve the services people count on and help provide them with the skills they need to succeed as we work together to build a strong, sustainable economy throughout our province.”Libraries provide vital services to British Columbians of all ages so they can have free, equitable access to quality sources of information. Libraries increase opportunities for people to contribute to their communities, reducing inequality to information access, helping close the divide between poverty and opportunity, while helping remove barriers that can hold people back. Public libraries are an important part of the B.C. government’s vision for a province that works for everyone.\\xa0Quotes:Dana McFarland, chair, BC Libraries Co-operative –“The BC Libraries Co-operative was built to help libraries help people. This funding means British Columbians will have access to more digital content and will enable us to invest in longer-term projects that benefit our communities. We thank the Province and look forward to working together with our members to support people by improving access to public libraries’ online collections and internet through connectivity initiatives.”Scott Hargrove, chair, Association of BC Public Library Directors, and CEO, Fraser Valley Regional Library –“Public libraries play a key role in helping our communities connect to the digital world. This funding is very welcome, especially given the ever-increasing demand on library digital resources. We look forward to supporting innovation in our communities while continuing to work with the ministry on its strategic plan for libraries.”Mike Gagel, president, BC Library Trustees Association, and chair, Prince George Public Library Board –“The Ministry of Education's new Strategic Plan for BC Public Libraries, along with a $3-million one-time grant, demonstrates the government's understanding of the important and unique role that public libraries play in building resilient communities.

For this reason, the CRT will not process\\xa0new applications for default decisions and orders from March 18, 2020, until at least May 15, 2020.\\xa0A default decision is when the CRT decides in favour of an applicant because the other party did not respond to the dispute by the deadline.Anyone who needs the CRT to consider waiving, suspending or extending a mandatory time period is encouraged to contact the tribunal immediately, with their dispute number and the reason for the request, by email or phone.\\xa0 The CRT can\\xa0consider altering timelines only during a declared state of emergency. Once the state of emergency ends, regular deadlines will apply.The CRT waives fees for those who cannot afford to pay them. CRT fees, for items such as filing an application for dispute resolution, adding third-party claims or filing a notice of objection over a decision, range from $25 to $200.People with\\xa0low incomes do not have to pay CRT fees. If a person cannot afford CRT fees due to a COVID-19 related loss of income, but do not yet fit the fee waiver guidelines, they can contact the CRT with their dispute number and the CRT will consider their request. People can also ask for a fee waiver at any time in the CRT process if their circumstances change.The CRT is monitoring the COVID-19 situation as it progresses and may extend the May 15, 2020, timeline further in the interest of fairness.

Our government is committed to helping make life a little easier during this unprecedented and very challenging time.”The Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD) is establishing an Emergency Relief Support Fund for children and youth with special needs and their families. The fund will provide a direct payment of $225 per month to eligible families over the next three months (to June 30, 2020).Using a needs-based approach, the emergency funding will support 50% more of the eligible families that are currently awaiting services. This payment can be used to purchase supports that help alleviate stress. These could include:\\nmeal preparation and grocery shopping assistance;\\nhomemaking services\\ncaregiver relief support (e.g., funded support to allow a family member to provide temporary care for a child or youth);\\ncounselling services, online or by phone; and\\nand other services that support family functioning.\\nPolicy guidelines for many Children and Youth with Special Needs (CYSN) services will be more flexible to ensure families continue to benefit from other funding and supports, even as access to many in-person school and community-based services remain limited:\\nFamilies with children in care on a special needs agreement or a voluntary care agreement will not have to make monthly maintenance payments for the duration of the pandemic period. This will provide temporary relief to parents who may be struggling with income or housing insecurity related to the pandemic.\\nSupported Child Development and Aboriginal Supported Child Development programs will be able to extend extra staffing during school hours to help with the reduced availability of school-based services. Children of parents who are essential service providers and need extra staffing supports for their child will continue to receive those throughout the pandemic period.\\nEligibility and access to At Home Program medical benefits will be relaxed, and any families receiving benefits will continue to do so without the need for a reassessment during the pandemic period.\\nParameters on services purchased with Autism Funding will be expanded, allowing families to use up to 35% of funding to purchase equipment and items that assist in home learning and virtual instructional approaches.\\nFamilies may direct their child’s Autism Funding to access family counselling and therapy services with a qualified provider for all age categories accessing the Autism Funding program.\\nMCFD\\xa0recognizes that each child and family faces unique circumstances and has unique needs. Families are encouraged to reach out to their CYSN worker to see how they can benefit from emergency help.The Emergency Relief Support Fund is sustained by a $900,000 investment.

In the midst of a global pandemic that has affected hundreds of people throughout this province and neighbouring jurisdictions, British Columbians and visitors from other provinces are urged to follow the advice of public health officials.The restrictions will be enforced by the Province’s natural resource officers, conservation officers and the RCMP, who will\\xa0conduct regular patrols and educate the public at access points into the area. People who do not comply with the restrictions may be issued a violation ticket for $115 and told to leave the area.The restrictions for the Koocanusa Recreation Strategy area align with the decision by Recreation Sites and Trails BC to close its campgrounds and amenities to gatherings and overnight camping in response to\\xa0COVID-19.Quick Facts:\\nThe B.C. government has been working collaboratively with the Ktunaxa Nation, stakeholders and local governments for several years on a Koocanusa Recreation Strategy.\\nThe development of this strategy includes the management of camping and trail use in the area.\\nMudbogging is not considered a legitimate activity and is neither supported nor included in the Koocanusa Recreation Strategy.\\nLearn More:Koocanusa Recreation Strategy: http://www.koocanusarecreation.ca/koocanusa-recreation-strategyRecreation Sites and Trails BC:\\xa0 www.sitesandtrailsbc.caFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nBC Parks is immediately closing all provincial parks in response to the widespread call for increased action to address COVID-19.The closure responds to both the federal and provincial directives that people should stay close to home to reduce COVID-19 transmission risk. This temporary measure means people should not be going to provincial parks until further notice.“Because physical distancing works, it is critical that we take every action needed to restrict the spread of COVID-19. This applies to British Columbians and out-of-province visitors who were planning to visit or stay at our provincial parks. The message is clear: stay home, avoid travel, do not put yourself or others at risk,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy.“I understand and share the love people in British Columbia have for the outdoors and the connection between health and proximity to nature. We tried to provide safe space for people to get some exercise and fresh air in our beautiful parks. But it has proven too challenging to maintain safe distance between visitors. This action is difficult but necessary. We look forward to the day we can welcome people back to our wonderful parks.”The decision to close the park system is informed by continued feedback from RCMP, local government, First Nations, local search-and-rescue organizations and the general public. While many people are observing the physical distancing requirements set by the provincial health officer (PHO), some continue to ignore the order, making enforcement in a wilderness setting challenging.The timing of this decision is important given the upcoming long weekend and the beginning of the busy season for outdoor recreation and camping. BC Parks is also extending the ban on all camping in provincial parks until May 31, 2020, in alignment with neighbouring jurisdictions and the temporary closure of Canada’s national parks. Refunds for bookings up to May 31 will be sent automatically.As previously announced, the Recreation Sites and Trails BC (RSTBC) branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development has also closed its campgrounds and amenities in response to the COVID-19 situation.BC Parks has taken a scaled and phased in approach to limiting park access following PHO requirements and the latest COVID-19 transmission data. BC Parks recognizes the value of nature in contributing to public health and wellness and will expand access to the park system as soon as the PHO indicates it can be done without increasing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.Learn More:Any change to provincial park access or services will be posted to the BC Parks website: http://bcparks.caFor status updates on RSTBC campgrounds, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/sports-culture/recreation/camping-hiking/sites-trailsFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on TwitterFor provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\xa0\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new long-term care facility outbreaks in the last day. Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health teams continue to provide support to the affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 213 cases of COVID-19.“To date, 805 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 138 individuals are hospitalized, and 66 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Starting tomorrow and over the coming days, British Columbians of many faiths, along with millions around the world, will be celebrating major religious holidays in ways that many have never experienced before.“B.C.’s faith leaders have taken the challenge of maintaining physical distance to heart and are using these holidays as an opportunity to reinforce our commitment to showing kindness and care for our communities.“We call on faith leaders, followers and congregations to pay special attention to our Elders and seniors to ensure we protect them by connecting safely from a distance.“We know many people must manage chronic diseases and other health issues. We encourage people to continue to connect with\\xa0their primary care provider or family physician for ongoing care. Phone and virtual resources are available for everyone.“This long weekend, we need to stay home, to stay in our communities and to stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside. Avoiding unnecessary travel, particularly to smaller communities, where they may\\xa0be unable to support you if you get sick and where they have fewer resources, is an important way we can protect ourselves and our loved ones.“Let’s continue to stand united, to stay strong and do all we can to flatten the curve.”Learn More:For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\nOr www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nOn Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0\\nOn Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\xa0\\nOn YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.7_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nEffective at noon (Pacific time) on Thursday, April 16, 2020, most open burning activities will be prohibited throughout British Columbia to reduce the likelihood of human-caused wildfires, although campfires will still be allowed.The following activities will be prohibited, and these restrictions will remain in effect until the public is otherwise notified:\\nCategory 2 open fires;\\nCategory 3 open fires;\\nResource Management open fires;\\nthe use of fireworks;\\nthe use of sky lanterns; and\\nthe use of burn barrels or burn cages of any size or description (except when used for a campfire).\\nThese prohibitions apply to all public and private land within British Columbia, unless specified otherwise (e.g., in a local government bylaw). Check with local government authorities for any other restrictions before lighting any fire. A poster explaining the different categories of open burning is available online: www.gov.bc.ca/openfireregsA map of the affected areas is available online: http://ow.ly/8uct30qvSv2COVID-19 and wildfire responseThese open burning prohibitions will reduce demands on firefighting resources and help protect the health and safety of the public, as well as BC Wildfire Service staff. They will also help reduce the impact of wildfire smoke on air quality and public health during the COVID-19 pandemic.A strategic deployment of wildfire management resources is critical this fire season, so it is especially important to reduce the number of unnecessary, human-caused wildfires. It is vital BC Wildfire Service staff remain healthy to respond to wildfires throughout the 2020 season and ensure the BC Wildfire Service’s response capability is not affected.During the current pandemic, larger open burns pose an unnecessary risk and could detract from wildfire detection and response capabilities. The open burning prohibitions coming into effect on April 16 should decrease the number of false alarms (where firefighters respond to a report of smoke, only to find the smoke is coming from a controlled burn and not from a wildfire).These open burning prohibitions also support the BC Centre for Disease Control’s recommendation to help reduce excess air pollution in airsheds throughout the province.EnforcementEnforcement of fire prohibitions is undertaken by:\\nthe Compliance and Enforcement Branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development;\\nthe Conservation Officer Service; and\\nthe RCMP.\\nAll illegal fires will be investigated, and charges may be laid under the Wildfire Act or Wildfire Regulation, depending on the outcome of the investigation.Anyone found in contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.For the latest information on current wildfire activity, burning restrictions, and air quality advisories, go to: http://www.bcwildfire.ca \\xa0Follow the latest wildfire news:\\non Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovFireInfo\\non Facebook: http://facebook.com/BCForestFireInfo\\nLearn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nTo support British Columbians who need a place to self-isolate\\xa0and to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the Province is partnering with local governments, non-profits and the hotel industry.So far, more than 900 spaces have been secured at 23 sites including hotels, motels and community centres throughout B.C.“These new spaces are a critical part of how we can support those who are vulnerable in our community, including those who are experiencing homelessness or living in communal locations where the virus could spread more quickly,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “In partnership with health authorities and local government, these new spaces are helping us mitigate the effect of this virus and support our health-care system in communities across the province.”These new rooms and community centre beds are assisting a range of people, including people experiencing homelessness, people without safe spaces to self-isolate and youth.In addition, some hotels are reserved specifically for people who have COVID-19 and need a place to self-isolate while they recover. Other spaces are for patients being discharged from hospitals who do not have COVID-19 and who do not need emergency care, but still require ongoing health care – freeing up much needed beds in hospitals.Health authorities are identifying those who require self-isolation and working with BC Housing to refer people to hotel rooms or community centres. Some of these facilities are already operational, while the others are expected to be ready in the coming days and weeks. In addition to the more than 900 spaces secured to date, more rooms have been identified in communities throughout\\xa0the province to be able to expand capacity if a need is identified by health authorities.Non-profit societies who have significant experience working with vulnerable populations will oversee the day-to-day management of the hotels, motels and community centre spaces. Staff will be on site regularly and will provide daily meals and cleaning services. When required, health-care workers will also provide on-site care to ensure people are getting the medical attention they need.This initiative is part of the Province’s efforts to stop the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable people, by ensuring those who need it have the space to self-isolate when they need to.\\xa0\\xa0Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.More information about how BC Housing is supporting British Columbians during the COVID-19 outbreak can be found here: https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19For a French translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Self-isolation_French.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Self_Isolation_Punjabi.pdfFor a traditional Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Self-isolation_TradChinese.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

We are saddened to report that we have had a community death of a known COVID-19 case in the Vancouver Coastal health region. The BC Coroners Service is investigating, as is the process for any sudden unexpected death that takes place in community. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“The Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions continue to respond to outbreaks and new cases in long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 210 cases of COVID-19. Residents in these facilities are our most vulnerable citizens, and efforts to protect them continue to be a major focus of our health teams. Vancouver Coastal Health has one new long-term care facility outbreak, while three outbreaks at long-term care homes in that region have been declared over.“A new community outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected at a federal correctional centre in Mission. Correctional Service Canada has implemented outbreak response protocols at the facility.“To date, 783 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 140 individuals are currently hospitalized, 72 of those are in intensive care.\\xa0The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“While it is encouraging to see the overall rate of new cases in British Columbia in the last few days levelling, we also continue to see new outbreaks in the community and with vulnerable individuals.“These hot spots are very concerning, as they can quickly escalate and further challenge our health system –\\xa0something we have seen in many other parts of the world.“We must all work to ensure our firewall stays strong and remain united in our efforts to hold the line.“British Columbians can help to flatten our curve and protect our communities by staying home as much as possible, continuing to follow physical distancing measures when out, and importantly, continuing to support loved ones and others in our communities.“We recently made a call for British Columbians to donate blood. Volunteers in the Sikh community stepped up in response to our appeal. The Sikh Nation Blood Drive is the largest of its kind in Canada, and it is working with Canadian Blood Services to launch a new blood drive. We thank them, and the many British Columbians who have responded to that call, for their generosity.“As travellers return, we welcome you home to join us and do your part by following provincial and federal orders to immediately self-isolate for 14 days.“Let’s continue to make a 100% commitment to breaking the chain of transmission.”Learn More:For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca\\nOr www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\xa0\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\non Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0\\non Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\xa0\\non YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.6_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure plans to tender repair work for a section of Highway 14 at Parkinson Hill, just east of Port Renfrew, in the coming weeks.People using Highway 14 in the Port Renfrew area are advised that significant repairs are required, with overnight highway closures necessary during construction.The highway has been reduced to a single lane of traffic since November 2018 after a significant rainfall resulted in a slope failure. The current plan to address the slope failure is to first build a 220-metre-long retaining wall, followed by significant deep road-base repairs along a 500-metre section of Highway 14.The work will be done overnight to minimize the impact to traffic. The ministry intends to close Highway 14 between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. nightly, except for Saturday and Sunday nights, for a duration of about six months while the retaining wall is built. Similar closures would also be required in early 2021 as the road-base repairs are completed. During these closures, accommodations will be made for emergency access.The ministry is advising key area stakeholders of project details, including First Nations, local governments and emergency services.The project will go to tender in the coming weeks. With a successful tender, construction could begin this summer, with completion by March 2021. Further details and the final traffic management plan will be made available to the public prior to the start of construction.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nWhen an outbreak hits a community, one of the most urgent things people want is information. This is human nature, as information allows us to protect ourselves, our families and our loved ones.Information is at the heart of public health: knowing what our risks are, where they are coming from and who is affected. One of the key ways we gather information is through active contact tracing, when public-health teams map the transmission, alert those at risk and close the circle to break the chain.Public-health protocols also dictate that when the potential for transmission is unknown, we must immediately alert the public. From the very beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in B.C., we have been doing exactly that – alerting people to the risks within communities through regular briefings and connecting with individuals who are close contacts. When we cannot close the circle, we open the circle.Public health is boots-on-the-ground health care, which means teams work to connect with each and every person who may be at risk of exposure to COVID-19. We do this to provide individual support and, equally important, to continue to follow the transmission trail.Initially, public-health teams identified the source of transmission was from travellers. That is why our briefings listed travel locations and cruise ships. With that information known, we were able to put precautions in place.However, as we have seen here in B.C. and globally, once there is community transmission, there is no boundary to the spread of COVID-19. Simply put, the risk is everywhere.It would be irresponsible to mention only a few communities and give people outside those areas a false sense that they are not susceptible or at lower risk. Every health region in British Columbia has people with COVID-19. Every community and home town – no matter how large or small – is at risk.As we notify the public about COVID-19 cases, we have been careful about how much we disclose about the personal details of people who were potentially exposed and the specific location of confirmed cases. This is because, as with many communicable diseases, there is still very much of a stigma associated with infection.We want people who have symptoms to contact us and to feel safe contacting us, knowing their personal information will be protected. This is important to everyone. It allows public-health teams to do the work they need to do to keep all of us safe.So, while I understand the desire to know and understand what the COVID-19 situation is in your community, I need to emphasize that knowing where the positive cases are does not protect you, your family or your community. The actions you take will do that.No one is immune from this disease, but everyone can make a difference. Every British Columbian has a part to play to flatten the curve.Wash your hands, do not touch your face, stay home if you are ill, and stay apart with physical distancing. Let’s all do the right thing.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBCFor the provincial health officer's orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.For a French translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/No-Boundaries-COVID19_FR.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/No-Boundaries-COVID19_Punjabi.pdfFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/OpEd_PHO_Chinese.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAs part of British Columbia’s emergency novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response plan, the Province is partnering with the BC Care Providers Association (BCCPA) to launch EquipCare BC to help seniors in long-term care and assisted living homes.EquipCare BC is a new program that will provide $10 million to enhance infection prevention and control, and improve quality and safety in long-term care and assisted living homes throughout the province.“Seniors and residents of long-term care and assisted living homes are the most vulnerable due to complications associated with COVID-19,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Our goal is to ensure that both residents and health-care workers are protected to the maximum extent possible.”More than 240 long-term care homes and more than 200 assisted living homes in B.C. will be eligible for funding to support increased infection prevention and control measures in their homes. Funds may be used to buy items, including outbreak carts and mobile hand-hygiene sinks, touchless towel and soap dispensers, and safe handling equipment for waste and laundry.“We are committed to protecting our seniors and elders during this critical time of COVID-19,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors. “This program will further equip long-term care and assisted living residences with the tools to enhance safety measures for seniors and caregivers\\xa0in these residences.”\\xa0BCCPA will administer the program and accept applications from facilities beginning on Saturday, April 4, 2020. The program will initially focus on supporting infection prevention and control through to the end of summer to address immediate needs related to COVID-19. Following this, the focus of the program will shift to funding for safety and quality improvements in publicly funded facilities.“With this new funding, we can move swiftly to get these important protections against the spread of COVID-19 in our care homes and assisted living residences,” said Daniel Fontaine, CEO, BCCPA. “Operators can expect to receive funding within weeks of a completed application. Not only will EquipCare BC be an efficiently run program, but it will continue to improve workplace safety and quality of life for seniors in care.”Oversight for EquipCare BC will be provided by a group of industry stakeholders and government, including representatives from BCCPA, SafeCare BC, Denominational Health Association and the Ministry of Health. An additional appointment to the oversight committee will include a provincial representative with expertise in infection prevention control.Further information about EquipCare BC will be posted here: www.bccare.caThe launch of EquipCare BC supports additional actions in place to protect seniors from the risks of COVID-19. In addition, the Province is providing the United Way of the Lower Mainland with $50 million to increase seniors’ supports at community service agencies throughout British Columbia.Quick Facts:\\nIn 2019, 20% of B.C.’s population was 65 or over; in 15 years, this is expected to rise to 25%.\\nEquipCare BC expands the mandate and scope of the Seniors Safety Quality Improvement Program (SSQIP).\\nSSQIP funded $10 million of safety and quality improvements to 99% of eligible long-term care operators in B.C.\\nThrough the program, operators purchased more than 8,000 new items, including beds and mattresses, shower chairs and tubs, mobility equipment, lighting and visual aids, sensory rooms, music therapy and ergonomic furniture.\\nLearn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBCFor provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.To learn more about the BC Care Providers Association, visit: www.bccare.ca\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nIndigenous post-secondary students experiencing financial pressures will benefit from additional provincial emergency funding.Government is providing an additional $1.5 million to supplement the Indigenous Emergency Assistance Fund, which assists Indigenous students who are experiencing an unexpected financial emergency that may affect their ability to finish their studies. Support is available through all 25 public post-secondary institutions in B.C., as well as Native Education College (NEC).“Our government is increasing emergency financial assistance for Indigenous students to ensure they have the necessary funds to focus on staying heathy, meeting their educational goals and finishing their semester,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “By supporting Indigenous students to succeed, we are doing our part to implement article 23 of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action.”In addition to emergency living expenses like groceries, cell phone bills and childcare, the fund supports Indigenous learners through other unanticipated expenses like medical, dental and optical costs, and travel costs for family crisis or community obligations.“These additional emergency funds to support B.C.’s Indigenous students are vital right now,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “No one should have to choose between an education and survival, and these emergency funds will help Indigenous students complete their studies with a better sense of well-being.”Students who access the emergency funding do not have to repay it. Indigenous students can contact the Indigenous Student Service Centre on campus, which will help with the application process to receive the financial assistance.Since 2017, $1.1 million has been provided to the Indigenous Emergency Assistance Fund with more than 3,700 Indigenous students accessing the fund in that time frame. The funding supports the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 21.1 and 21.2, and the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada 23.i.Quick Facts:\\nThe Indigenous Emergency Assistance Fund was launched in 2012 after research showed that having access to emergency relief funds was indispensable to the success of many Indigenous learners, allowing them to complete their studies.\\nThe federal government has also announced $305 million for a new distinctions-based Indigenous Community Support Fund to address immediate needs in First Nations, Inuit and Métis Nation communities across Canada.\\nA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nDrivers are reminded that winter tire regulations remain in place until April 30, 2020, on many highways to account for early spring snowfall.The ministry is following the advice and orders of the provincial health officer and the federal government to keep British Columbians as safe as possible and stop the spread of COVID-19. While highways and roads remain open, the provincial health officer recommends that\\xa0people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.Winter tire regulations are currently in effect for most B.C. highways so people should ensure their vehicle is equipped with tires with the mountain/snowflake or mud and snow (M + S) symbol when travelling on designated routes.Tires must be in good condition and have a minimum tread depth of 3.5 millimetres. For rural highways and mountain passes, tires with the mountain/snowflake symbol provide the best traction and handling.Last winter, the regulations were extended to April 30 from March 31 on select highways, most of which are located in the Interior and northern parts of the province. Road conditions can change quickly and snowfall is still possible in these regions.While maintenance crews strive to keep routes safe and in the best possible condition, people must use caution and slow down when they encounter bad weather or limited visibility. Driving to current conditions will improve safety for everyone on the road.Crashes can be prevented when people are prepared. Here are some helpful tips for travelling in winter driving conditions:\\nCheck the weather forecast and adjust travel times to more favourable conditions, or choose alternative routes.\\nFor current road conditions, check DriveBC before leaving, as well as the nearly 800 highway webcam views available at more than 400 locations throughout B.C.\\nWear comfortable clothing that does not restrict movement while driving, but bring warm clothing (winter boots, coat, gloves and hat) in case getting out of the vehicle is required.\\xa0\\nHave an emergency plan. Ensure the vehicle has a full tank of gas and is equipped with a windshield scraper and snow brush, food and water, a first-aid kit and other emergency supplies.\\nIf stuck or stranded, do not panic. Stay with the vehicle for safety and warmth and if a cellphone is available, call for roadside assistance. If there is an emergency, call 911.\\nHeavy snowfall or rapidly warming spring temperatures can increase the risk of avalanches in some areas. This can cause temporary highway closures while ministry avalanche experts ensure safe conditions. During these times, obey all traffic control personnel.The Sea to Sky Highway in the Lower Mainland and the Malahat on Vancouver Island are not included. Winter tire regulations were lifted on those routes on March 31.For non-health related\\xa0information and supports, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19\\nOr call 1 888-COVID19, between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.Learn More:List of highways designated for extended winter tire regulations: http://ow.ly/ZO4x50yVMOrTravel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMRO\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 55 new cases, for a total of 1,121 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 525 are in the Vancouver Coastal health region, 386 are in the Fraser Health region, 72 are in the Island Health region, 121 are in the Interior Health region and 17 are in the Northern Health region.“In the last 24 hours, we are saddened to report six deaths in the Vancouver Coastal, Fraser and Island health regions. There have been 31 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia. The majority have been residents of long-term care. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“A new community outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected with an inmate in a correctional centre in the Interior Health region. BC Corrections has implemented response protocols and the inmate has been isolated.“The Provincial Health Services Authority, which is responsible for health care in B.C.’s correctional centres, is working with the Interior public health team to investigate and undertake contact tracing.“There have been no new reported cases in long-term care and assisted living facilities in the last day.“Residents at long-term care and assisted-living homes are very vulnerable to COVID-19. One of the most important things we can do to protect them, and those caring for them, is to make it possible for workers to provide services at a single location, reducing the risk of transmission between facilities.“We are working diligently with unions and employer groups to do this, while ensuring that these workers are at least\\xa0‘made whole’. They are responding courageously to monumental challenges during this unprecedented time and deserve our respect and support.“To date, 641 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 149 individuals are hospitalized, 68 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We continue to see patients with serious illness requiring hospitalization for COVID-19. This tells us that the risk remains high for everyone in British Columbia.“Without exception, all travellers returning to Canada must immediately comply with the federal government's quarantine order and isolate for 14 days.“Each of us must also continue to follow good hand hygiene, stay home as much as possible and stay apart with physical distancing.“In the coming weeks there will be a number of major religious celebrations on the calendar. Just as we have seen around the world, we call on our faith leaders to postpone all in-person gatherings and use the many tools we have available to connect and celebrate with followers in other ways.“We must stand united and working together, we must follow the orders and precautions we have in place, and we must do all we can protect our province.”Learn More:For more information on the COVID-19 ethics framework, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-professionals/clinical-resources/covid-19-care/ethicsFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: \\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBCFor provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nOn Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\nOn Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nOr Youtube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.2_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

People and businesses urgently need support,” said Premier John Horgan. “We will be there to protect people’s health and give immediate relief during the crisis.

       "  '\\n\\nTo ensure B.C.’s most vulnerable – including people on income or disability assistance and low-income seniors – do not encounter additional barriers during the COVID-19 crisis, the Province is implementing a series of temporary supports and supplements.“We are putting in place measures that complement the federal crisis measures to support our most vulnerable populations and ensure they do not fall deeper into poverty as a result of COVID-19,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “This is a stressful time for everyone, but for those struggling to put food on the table at the best of times, it is important that we ensure there are no additional barriers to get what they need to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy.”\\xa0For\\xa0people in B.C. currently receiving income assistance or disability assistance, the Province will temporarily exempt federal employment insurance benefits, including the new $2,000 Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). These payments will be fully exempted for the next three months so people receiving income assistance and disability assistance in B.C. will benefit from these new emergency federal support programs, without any reductions to their monthly assistance payments. \\xa0For everyone on income assistance or disability assistance who is not eligible for the emergency federal support programs, including the CERB, the Province will provide an automatic $300-monthly COVID-19 crisis supplement for the next three months. This supplement will also be provided to low-income seniors who receive the B.C. Senior’s Supplement and recipients of income assistance or disability assistance who reside in special care facilities.With the current provincewide suspension of BC Transit and Translink bus fares, the Province will also provide all BC Bus Pass Program users receiving income assistance and disability assistance with the $52 Transportation Supplement for the duration of the fare suspension. This will be included on the next cheque and for each subsequent month while the fare suspension remains in place.Existing Compass passes under the BC Bus Pass Program will not be cancelled and will remain active during this time, so people will not need to reapply for bus passes in the future. This will also ensure people can still use SkyTrain and SeaBus services that are still charging fares. There is no change for eligible low-income seniors who will continue to have an active bus pass provided by the BC Bus Pass Program.These interim measures further complement government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.To further support vulnerable people, the Province recently provided a $3-million emergency grant to Food Banks BC to distribute among food banks provincewide. The grant will support immediate needs to buy and distribute food, pay employees and cover other costs essential to the delivery of their food programs.Recognizing that vulnerable people in different circumstances face distinct risks, the provincial Vulnerable Population Working Group continues to identify, assess and address the immediate challenges faced by five specific groups – people living on the street, people experiencing homelessness living in encampments, shelter residents, tenants of private single-residence occupancies and tenants in social and supportive housing.This working group includes representatives from the ministries of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Social Development and Poverty Reduction, Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, Mental Health and Addictions, Children and Family Development, Health, Public Safety and Solicitor General, Finance, Attorney General, as well as Emergency Management BC, the City of Vancouver, the Office of the Provincial Health Officer, BC Centre for Disease Control, First Nations Health Authority, Provincial Health Services Authority, regional health authorities, BC Housing and Community Living British Columbia.Reducing poverty is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/sdprFor non-medical\\xa0information and supports, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19\\xa0between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The changes government is\\xa0implementing are intended to assist with some of these concerns.For example, a child care provider will not be liable for a child in their care or a family member being exposed to COVID-19, so long as they are following established protocols on how to prevent the spread of the virus, like proper handwashing, regular cleaning and disinfecting and identifying children who are sick.Essential service providers who are not compliant with respective authorities or who are grossly negligent will not receive protection under the order and will be held liable for damages. The order only applies to situations related to COVID-19 and will remain in effect for as long as the state of emergency remains in place. Additionally, it will continue to protect essential service providers until any relevant limitation periods have expired.The Province, in consultation with Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has defined the essential services British Columbians rely on in their daily lives in the context of COVID-19 response and recovery.

Each post-secondary institution will determine the specific amount a student can receive based on their individual needs.Quick Facts:\\nIn the academic year 2018-19, the Province helped 446 students through its annual emergency assistance funding.\\nInternational and out-of-province students face unique challenges.

       "  \"\\n\\nThe provincial health officer (PHO) has issued new guidelines to support compliance with orders on business closures and gatherings, under the Public Health Act.The new guidelines for municipal bylaw officers and other compliance officers give clear instruction on warnings, public education and fines – and what can be issued by whom – to make sure there is compliance with the PHO’s orders and, if necessary, they are enforced consistently throughout B.C. communities.“Local governments are key partners in ensuring the provincial health officer’s orders are obeyed so people in our communities can stay healthy,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “It’s important that communities, and those responsible for compliance, have clear and consistent guidelines to enforce the provincial health officer’s orders so businesses can adapt their workplaces and help keep people safe.”To strengthen compliance and enforcement measures, the Province will redeploy provincial compliance staff from other ministries to support local governments under the direction of the PHO. This includes liquor and cannabis control and licensing inspectors, gambling enforcement and investigations officers, and community safety personnel.As outlined in provincial orders issued last week, bylaw enforcement officers do not have the ability to detain an individual as a result of a contravention or suspected contravention of a public health order, or issue a fine or penalty, including an administrative penalty, under the Public Health Act.Local bylaw and other compliance officers can, however, provide enforcement assistance for the PHO’s orders by:\\nmonitoring facilities and areas closed to the public by a public health order;\\nproviding warnings, information and advice to businesses and members of the public about public health orders, including warnings to businesses and members of the public who may be acting in contravention of a public health order; and\\nproviding information on potential contraventions of a public health order for followup\\xa0by health authorities.\\nCompliance officers will provide public health agencies with recommendations and advice on whether further action is necessary. Any enforcement will be at the direction of the PHO or local medical health officer.Public concerns regarding compliance with the PHO’s orders should be directed to local governments, who can dispatch bylaw\\xa0officers for followup. \\xa0To view the PHO’s guidance toward compliance and enforcement, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/covid-19/compliance_and_enforcement_guidance_march_31_2020.pdfAll PHO orders and guidance documents can be found here: www.gov.bc.ca/PHOguidanceQuick Facts:\\nLocal governments are strongly encouraged to focus their enforcement efforts on PHO’s orders relating to COVID-19.\\nThis would provide a consistent approach throughout the province and reflects the PHO’s recommendations for individuals and communities.\\n\\nLocal governments are encouraged to avoid adopting any parallel bylaws and instead, focus on supporting enforcement of the existing PHO’s orders.\\nAll guidance on enforcement of the PHO’s orders will be at the PHO's request to police and overseen by a unified command structure overseen by the Police Services Branch and comprised of the ministries of Public Safety and Solicitor General; Attorney General; Municipal Affairs and Housing; and Emergency Management BC.\\nLearn More:A full listing of municipal contacts is available online: https://www.civicinfo.bc.ca/directoriesFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community,\\xa0visit:\\nhttp://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For the COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and planning materials, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/pandemic-influenzaFor more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit the centre’s website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For more information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

Our condolences to everyone who has lost loved ones.“We continue to see new cases in long-term care and assisted-living facilities. There are now COVID-19 cases in 21 facilities in B.C., all in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols at all sites. \\xa0“To date, 606 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 142 individuals are currently hospitalized, 67 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“This is an incredibly challenging time for all of us. Along with the serious health risks of COVID-19, many are also facing financial hardship and mental health struggles.“We know, without a doubt, that with all of us working together, we will get through this. Our goal is to have the restrictions and orders in place for as short a time as possible.“Maintaining strong social connections – at a distance – is one of the best ways that we can take care of ourselves and show support for each other.“The 7 p.m. cheer is heard across our province each evening. We have seen flowers and groceries on door steps, young children on virtual playdates, teens hosting gaming marathons and countless other examples of community connection.“We have also received hundreds of offers of support from those with supplies of personal protection equipment and medical supplies.“A new joint government-business COVID-19 Supply Hub launched today to fast-track sourcing and delivery of supplies to our front-line health workers.“Global Affairs Canada has registered tens of thousands of Canadian passport holders looking to come home from countries heavily impacted by COVID-19, some starting later this week.“All travellers arriving in British Columbia must immediately comply with federal quarantine orders. There must be no ambiguity from the federal government. They must make the order clear and support its enforcement with an increased presence at every port of entry to our country.“All of us have to step up our game now.”Learn More:For more information on the COVID-19 ethics framework, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-professionals/clinical-resources/covid-19-care/ethicsFor information and supports that are not health-related, call 1 888 COVID19 between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week, or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19For a full listing of provincial health officer orders and guidance, visit: www.Gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool visit: www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded at: bc.thrive.health/For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\non Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\non Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\nor Youtube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.1_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfA backgrounder follows\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe Government of British Columbia and BC Hydro are helping people, small businesses and industries most impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.“We are facing unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19. People are out of work, and businesses are facing tough choices about whether they can stay open,” said Premier John Horgan. “Giving people relief on their power bills lets them focus on the essentials, while helping businesses and encouraging critical\\xa0industry to keep operating.”BC Hydro will offer new, targeted bill relief to provide immediate help to those most in need.Residential customers who have lost their jobs or are unable to work as a result of COVID-19 will receive a credit to help cover the cost of their electricity bills. The credit will be three times their average monthly bill over the past year at their home and does not have to be repaid.Small businesses that have been forced to close due to COVID-19 will have their power bills forgiven for three months. BC Hydro is waiving bills for these customers from April to June 2020.Major industries, like pulp and paper mills and mines, will have the opportunity to defer 50% of their bill payments for three months.“People who have lost their jobs or are unable to work due to COVID-19 shouldn’t have to choose between paying their rent or mortgage and paying their hydro bill,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “These measures will also provide relief to small businesses such as restaurants and retail shops who have had to close during COVID-19, and support them in reopening once the pandemic has passed.”In addition to this new targeted bill relief, BC Hydro rates will be reduced by 1% on April 1, 2020, after the B.C. Utilities Commission provided interim approval of the application BC Hydro submitted last August. This is the first rate decrease in decades.“We recognize the financial stress many of our customers are facing after losing their job or having to close their business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Chris O\\'Riley, president and chief executive officer, BC Hydro. “We hope that not having to worry about their electricity costs for a few months will help provide some temporary relief during these challenging times.”On March 13, 2020, BC Hydro introduced its COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program to provide residential and commercial customers with the option to defer payments or arrange a flexible payment plan to help pay their BC Hydro bills.Quick Facts:\\nThe average residential customer’s bill is $159 per month, so the average credit provided will be $477. Some customers may also be eligible for BC Hydro\\'s existing Customer Crisis Fund, which provides access to grants of up to $600 to pay their bills.\\nThe average bill savings for small businesses who qualify will be $121 per month, so the average total bill savings will be $363.\\nBC Hydro has halted all service disconnections for non-payment during COVID-19 and cancelled all non-emergency planned power outages affecting its customers.\\nThe Province’s COVID-19 Action Plan includes a new BC Emergency Benefit for Workers that will provide a one-time $1,000 payment to workers whose ability to work has been affected by the outbreak that will add to benefits that are received under federal supports.\\nThe Government of B.C. is also providing support for businesses through a 50% cut in school property taxes this year and allowing deferrals of a range of tax remittances that complement federal measures like the wage subsidy and interest-free loans.\\nLearn More:For further details on BC Hydro’s response to COVID-19, visit: https://www.bchydro.com/news/conservation/2020/covid-19-updates.htmlFor information and supports that are not health-related, call 1 888 COVID19 anytime between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week, or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19For information on the Government of Canada’s response to COVID-19, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.htmlFor information on the cancellation of\\xa0non-emergency planned power outages, visit: https://www.bchydro.com/power-outages/app/outage-conditions.htmlTranslations:For a Punjabi translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-BG_BC-Hydro-COVID-Relief_Punjabi.pdfFor a French translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-BG_BC-Hydro-COVID-Relief_FR.pdfFor a Chinese translation:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-BG_BC-Hydro-COVID-Relief_TCH.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

B.C.’s sport leaders responded quickly to the orders, direction and recommendations from the provincial health officer and cancelled tournaments, training schedules and other activities to protect people’s health. We understand this has had a significant impact on the province’s athletes, coaches, officials, sport organization staff and volunteers.“Starting in April 2020, the Province, through viaSport, will provide provincial, disability and multi-sport organizations with the ability to access $5 million, which represents 50% of their annual 2020-21 provincial funding allocation, to provide these organizations with access to cashflow sooner.“Sport plays a powerful role in helping people lead healthy, productive lives and contributes to the health and wellness of our communities.

Cela offrira ainsi un accès uniforme à cette plateforme aux éducateurs qui souhaitent communiquer de plusieurs autres manières avec les élèves et les parents. \\xa0L’apprentissage continu variera d’une école à l’autre selon les besoins des élèves. Certaines options comprennent des outils d’apprentissage en ligne ou des trousses de ressources ou des devoirs que les enseignants enverront aux parents par courrier électronique ou par la poste. Pour les éducateurs qui choisissent d’offrir l’apprentissage en ligne, Zoom leur donne une plateforme commune et cohérente pour communiquer avec leurs élèves et leur présenter des leçons.Pour assurer la sécurité et protéger la vie privée des élèves, le contrat de licence est conforme à la Loi sur l’accès à l’information et la protection de la vie privée (LAIPVP) de la Colombie-Britannique. Les administrateurs des technologies scolaires peuvent contrôler les autorisations et les privilèges, tout en désactivant les fonctions inutiles ou inappropriées. Les élèves recevront une adresse de site Web unique pour accéder à leur salle de classe virtuelle, sans avoir besoin d’un compte individuel. De plus, le serveur Zoom sera situé au Canada, avec un chiffrage supplémentaire, ce qui en fera une plateforme d’apprentissage sécuritaire.\\xa0Les\\xa0éducateurs recevront l’accès à Zoom par le truchement de leur conseil scolaire ce mois-ci, ainsi que des instructions simples pour utiliser ce logiciel. \\xa0Bien que la responsabilité de l’apprentissage continu incombe principalement aux enseignants et aux écoles, le gouvernement a lancé également Keep Learning BC (www.openschool.bc.ca/keeplearning), le 27 mars 2020. C’est un site central où les familles pourront trouver des idées d’activités éducatives pour tous les jours, des liens vers des ressources d’apprentissage gratuites, ainsi que des conseils pour aider les enfants à apprendre et pour assurer leur bien-être pendant qu’ils restent à la maison. Du matériel pédagogique sera ajouté à ce site Web qui sera mis à jour régulièrement.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Province has partnered with the Digital Technology Supercluster and the Business Council of British Columbia to create the COVID-19 Supply Hub, a made-in-B.C. online platform to co-ordinate, source and expedite medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) for provincial health authorities to support front-line health workers fighting COVID-19.The COVID-19 Supply Hub provides a single point of entry to triage and prioritize the thousands of offers and donations for essential supplies from business and other organizations since the onset of the COVID-19 response.“In this provincial state of emergency, partnership and co-ordination are critical to keep our front-line workers safe and support our COVID-19 response and recovery,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. \"Launching the COVID-19 Supply Hub is an important step in maintaining our supply chain and making sure essential goods and services are getting where they need to go, and fast.”Premier John Horgan said, “This made-in-B.C. innovation showcases how important it is to work together to support our front-line workers. By giving B.C. businesses a platform to help, we are enabling some of our best and brightest minds to meet the demands of this pandemic and help keep people safe.”Developed by local B.C. tech company Traction on Demand and built on the Salesforce platform, the COVID-19 Supply Hub will make the types and specifications of critical supplies needed publicly available. From there, proposals can be quickly and efficiently managed and evaluated, so the right products get to the right workers on the front lines as efficiently as possible.The COVID-19 Supply Hub’s initial focus is on sourcing supplies for the health-care system and front-line workers, though government is also accepting offers for other essentials, like cleaning supplies.The COVID-19 Supply Hub will be managed under the new Provincial Supply Coordination Unit at Emergency Management BC in partnership with the Provincial Health Services Authority as part of the Province’s cross-government approach to COVID-19 response and recovery.“This\\xa0initiative demonstrates how tech can be used quickly to make a difference in people’s lives,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness.\\xa0“I am incredibly proud of the leading-edge work being done by the Digital Technology Supercluster, the business community and companies like Traction on Demand. They are finding unique ways to help front-line workers meet the needs of those impacted the most by COVID-19.”Sue Paish, CEO, Digital Technology Supercluster, said, “From concept to actualization within one week, the supply hub is illustrative of the Supercluster’s ability to harness our community’s power of collaboration. We are moving at an unprecedented pace to meet the demands of this pandemic, with innovative solutions.

       "  '\\n\\nStarting in April 2020, the Province will remove invasive ivy that is growing on the Nelson Courthouse and causing building-integrity risks.A recent assessment by Fairbanks Architects Ltd. determined that the ivy is threatening the building’s structural integrity, including obstructing gutters and downspouts, preventing proper roof drainage, and damaging the chimney, roof and soffits. Ivy roots and tendrils are degrading the foundation, and there is evidence of water damage inside the building as well.Previously, a five-year trim-back maintenance plan was in place. It proved to be costly and inefficient due to the ivy’s rapid growth. The original stone for the building, Kootenay marble, is soft and susceptible to damage.The Province is contracting Cornerstone General Contracting to remove the ivy without the use of chemicals. The work must get underway in April. Timing beyond that would incur additional costs as the ivy will be in bloom. In carrying out this work, the contractor will follow the rules of the provincial health officer.Once the ivy has been removed, the courthouse will be thoroughly inspected for any further indications of damage. Repairs and future maintenance work will be identified and prioritized.A Nelson citizen is checking with a local nursery to see if it is possible to move, at their cost, the ivy root ball to different locations in the community or to individuals who may want a clipping. This idea was the result of a stakeholder group meeting held earlier this month. Other items discussed by the group included the project rationale and the risk of maintaining the status quo.The courthouse, which was designed by Francis M. Rattenbury and constructed in 1908, has heritage status in Nelson. Rattenbury also designed the Parliament Buildings and the Fairmont Empress Hotel in Victoria.Learn More: Nelson Courthouse: https://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/court-location/nelson\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nCameras are now clicking at busy, high-risk intersections around B.C., equipped to ticket the fastest vehicles.Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, has confirmed that automated speed enforcement equipment is now in place at all 35 planned Intersection Safety Camera (ISC) program sites and operating at 34 of them, on a 24/7 basis. Prominent warning signs are in place to warn and deter speeding drivers.Government is postponing activation of the new speed enforcement equipment at one location – Island Highway at Aulds Road in Nanaimo – until mid-September 2020. This grace period is to allow drivers time to adjust to a recent reduction of the speed limit on the highway there, to 70 km/h from 80 km/h. This site remains activated for red-light enforcement.A map showing all of B.C.’s ISC sites, and municipal and regional lists of them, are online here (linked\\xa0by region): https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/public-safety/intersection-safety-cameras/where-the-cameras-areSince B.C. activated its first five automated speed enforcement cameras at the end of July 2019, the program has issued more than 20,000 speeding tickets. The fastest ticketed vehicle clocked 174 km/h at a location where the posted speed limit is 80 km/h. Quarterly data for ISC red-light and speed violation tickets are here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/public-safety/intersection-safety-cameras/statisticsISC equipment captures images and speeds of the fastest vehicles passing through monitored intersections on red, yellow and green lights. Before mailing tickets, which carry fines but no penalty points, ISC officers review the digital images and data to confirm the applicable Motor Vehicle Act charge or charges. Notably, the registered owner of a vehicle that speeds through a red light at a speed-activated ISC intersection would face fines for both infractions.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe B.C. government has formally extended the provincial state of emergency to support the provincewide response to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the end of the day on April 14, 2020.“The next 14 days are critically important in our province’s unprecedented fight against COVID-19. What we do today will affect what our doctors, nurses and first responders face in the days and weeks ahead,” said Premier John Horgan. “Today, we’re asking all British Columbians to re-commit to doing their part. There are early signs that our actions are making a difference, and we can’t stop now.”Using the extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act, Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, has issued a series of orders to ensure a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 across all levels of government. Through these orders, the Province is taking an active role in co-ordinating the supply chain for essential goods and services, supporting the enforcement of the provincial health officer’s orders and prohibiting the secondary selling of essential goods and supplies.Government is also taking steps to ensure people and businesses are supported through this challenging time by:\\nproviding $5 billion in income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services;\\nhalting evictions, freezing rents and introducing a $500 temporary rental supplement;\\namending the Employment Standards Act to protect jobs for those unable to work for reasons relating to COVID-19;\\nlaunching a process to match essential service workers with child care in their communities and supporting child care providers with temporary emergency funding;\\nbolstering seniors’ supports at community service agencies with $50 million and expanding bc211, a provincewide information and referral service to match seniors whose support network has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak with volunteers;\\nsupporting families who rely on food banks with a $3-million emergency grant to Food Banks British Columbia; and\\nproviding people and organizations in the arts sector with a $3-million Arts and Culture Resilience Supplement to be administered by the BC Arts Council.\\n“Our government is continuing to take all actions necessary to keep our communities safe, goods moving, and essential service workers supported,” Farnworth said. “This is an unprecedented time in our province. We’re working hard to alleviate the pressures that we’re all facing, and we will get through this together.”The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18 after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency.The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and physical distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments. The call line is available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., in 110 languages. People with questions related to their health and COVID-19 should call 811.Quick Facts: \\nDeclarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.\\nThe provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time for up to 14 days at a time.\\nDuring the 2017 wildfire season, the province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.\\nLearn More:For information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, including for employers, businesses and schools, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

There are now COVID-19 cases in 19 facilities in B.C., all in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols at all sites. \\xa0“To date, 507 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 128 individuals are currently hospitalized, 61 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We are at a critical juncture in our provincial COVID-19 response. Every British Columbian has a part to play to flatten the curve. We must all do the right thing and be 100% committed.“No one is immune, but everyone can make a difference. If you are older, staying home keeps you away from those who could put you at risk. If you are young, staying apart means you are preserving important capacity within our health-care system for our elders and others at highest risk.“The Government of B.C. continues to provide new resources to support British Columbians during this challenging time.“We are providing our essential workers who are parents a new resource to access child care for children five\\xa0years old and younger.

       "  \"\\n\\nTo support parents who are essential service workers during the response to novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the Province is launching a new process.This process will match parents, who are working on the front lines of B.C.’s COVID-19 response and have children up to five years of age, with child care in their communities.Starting today, essential workers can fill out a new “parent” form to identify their need for urgent child care. Forms can be accessed by calling 1 888 338-6622 and selecting Option 4, or online:\\nwww.gov.bc.ca/essential-service-child-careChild Care Resource Referral (CCRR) centres in 38 communities will act as community-based hubs. The CCRRs will reach out to essential-service workers in their area who filled in the form to connect them with available licensed child care spaces.Applicants will be asked:\\nwhich category of essential worker they are;\\ntheir child’s age; and\\nin which community they need child care.\\nChild care spaces will be prioritized for children whose parents work in public health and health services, social services, law enforcement, first responders and emergency response sectors. Additional spaces will then be given to families working in other crucial roles, defined as essential service workers.The number of spaces available for essential service workers will be up to each child care operator, based on\\xa0its licensed capacity and following any additional health requirements established by the provincial health officer.Hours of operation for spaces will vary by facility. While many centres are open Monday to Friday, others may offer care on the weekends and outside the hours of 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Government is monitoring whether the needs of essential service workers for care outside of regular hours are being met. \\xa0Child care centres, which are open, are required to follow the child care licensing regulation and guidelines on how to prevent the spread of and protect children and staff from COVID-19. This includes proper handwashing, regular cleaning and disinfecting, as well as identifying children who are sick. Families who want to access child care services must also continue to ensure their children are practising physical distancing with anyone outside of their immediate family circle.To help the child care sector through this pandemic, the Ministry of Children and Family Development is providing temporary emergency funding to support providers and ensure access to child care is maintained for essential service workers.Licensed providers that are open and operating are eligible to receive emergency funding at a rate of seven times their average monthly child care operating base funding. Centres will continue to be eligible for the Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative and the Early Childhood Educator Wage Enhancement. In addition, families accessing care from these providers may be eligible for the Affordable Child Care Benefit.The form and matching process are temporary. They will remain in place for as long as the provincial health officer advises that all parents who can, should care for their children at home and that child care services can and must be provided for those families whose parents work in critical roles.\\xa0\\xa0The Ministry of Education has been working closely with school districts and independent schools to identify and support children, aged five to 12 years\\xa0(kindergarten to Grade 6), whose parents are essential service workers, with a focus on public health and health services, social services, law enforcement, first responders and emergency response sectors. School districts and independent school authorities have been asked to ensure students whose parents work in these fields have access to care during regular before-, during- and after-school hours.Hours of care will vary by school district and independent school. If essential service workers who have school-aged children need before-, during- and after-hours care for their children, they are asked to contact their school district directly. Most school districts have already reached out directly to families through surveys to gather information on urgent child care needs.As British Columbians navigate these uncertain times together, parents who can are asked to care for their children at home. All children and staff who are ill with fever, have cold, influenza or infectious respiratory symptoms of any kind must stay home. If they are unsure of their status, BCCOVID-19 BC Support App and Self-Assessment Tool and the BC Centre for Disease Control’s online assessment tool can help assess whether or not they can return to child care.Learn More:Frequently asked questions about the matching program can be found here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/FAQ_COVID_and_Child%20Care_Mar_30.pdfTo view the list of essential services in B.C. during the COVID-19 pandemic, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/family-and-social-supports/covid-19/list_of_essential_services.pdfFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/BCCOVID-19 BC Support App and Self-Assessment Tool: https://bc.thrive.health/The BC Centre for Disease Control's online assessment tool: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/A backgrounder follows.Translations:For a traditional Chinese translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/IB_child_care_matching_March30_Chinese.pdfFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/IB_child_care_matching_March30.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/IB_child_care_matching_March30_punjabi.pdf\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nYouth in care will not age out of services during the COVID-19 pandemic and those who have recently aged out will get extra assistance.“During these uncertain times, youth deserve our steady, consistent support to help them through,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “We don’t want anyone to fall through the cracks, so we’ve taken emergency steps to ensure young people in and from care can continue getting the services they count on.”Youth and young adults from care will continue receiving the same level of service during the pandemic, even if they were set to age out. This enables extra stability and support for young people who might otherwise face housing, educational and employment uncertainty. Youth currently living in foster care, contracted residential agencies or with relatives through the extended family program will be able to stay where they are. Social workers are modifying agreements to allow youth and caregivers to extend their current living arrangements once a youth reaches 19 years old.Young adults between the ages of 19 and 27 who are enrolled in the Agreements with Young Adults (AYA) program will continue to receive financial support despite school closures and other training program interruptions caused by the current pandemic. If applicable, these young adults may also be eligible to receive an extension of AYA support beyond the current maximum of 48 months. Youth who are nearing the end of an Independent Living or Youth agreement will be given options allowing them to continue receiving monthly living expenses past their 19th birthday. Social workers are contacting youth to guide them through this process.Additional efforts will be made to locate young adults who have recently aged out of care to connect them to other lines of available support, like the B.C. Emergency Benefit for workers and the Federal Emergency Care Benefit.These interim measures further complement government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.Learn More: For information on B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan and other government resources and updates, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19Agreements with Young Adults: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/family-social-supports/youth-and-family-services/teens-in-foster-care/agreements-with-young-adultsFor non-medical related information on COVID-19, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\nOr call: 1 888 COVID-19For medical-related information on COVID-19, visit: www.bccdc.ca\\nOr call: 811\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian\\xa0Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: March 28 to 29, and March 29 through to midday today.“In the first reporting period through March 28, we had 16 new cases, for a total of 900 cases in British Columbia.“In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 70 new cases, for a total of 970 cases in British Columbia.“This represents 86 new cases since we reported on Saturday.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 472 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 323 are in the Fraser Health region, 67 are in the Island Health region, 94 are in the Interior Health region and 14 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report two additional COVID-19 related deaths in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, resulting in a total of 19 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia. This includes the first death in the community as a result of COVID-19, as confirmed by the BC Coroners Service.“There are now COVID-19 cases in 13 long-term care and assisted\\xa0living homes in British Columbia. All are in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols at all sites. \\xa0“To date, 469 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 106 individuals are currently hospitalized, 60 of those in hospital are in intensive care and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We are at a critical juncture in our provincial COVID-19 response. We have two paths ahead: we will begin to see evidence of a flattened curve or our rates of infection will rise even more.“Our entire government is doing everything we can to address this challenge, and we need every person in our province to do the same. Let us be united in this singular purpose: in these next two crucial weeks we must be 100% committed to flattening the curve and lessening the devastating impacts of this virus.“While we are watching the epi-curve closely, we continue with the active readiness of our health-care system to prepare for the potential of a large spike in COVID-19 cases.“A shipment of one million surgical masks has arrived as we continue to restock our provincial personal-protection equipment supplies.“We\\xa0have designated 19 major hospitals across the province as primary COVID-19 facilities to deliver care to the most critically ill patients.“To maximize capacity at these primary sites, we are also readying a number of off-site treatment centres, such as the Vancouver Convention Centre (with resources for approximately 270 beds) and the new tower at the Royal Columbian Hospital (with resources for approximately 80 beds), to be ready for providing less acute in-patient care. In coming days, other health authorities will begin making similar preparations.“Additionally, in an effort to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, we are suspending pay parking for the patients, staff and visitors at all health authority owned and operated sites, effective April 1 until further notice. This change makes it easier for individuals to avoid touching screens and buttons at payment kiosks that may have been touched by someone previously, and also supports physical distancing measures.\\xa0Health authorities will provide details on this change of practice at each of their facilities.“This week, our K-12 educators and students will begin a new form of learning as in-class education remains suspended. The Keep Learning BC website is a new resource to give families additional support and provide guidance on how to incorporate learning into their everyday activities.“Equally important for families, as we all adjust to the physical distancing measures, is to use the many tools and creative solutions available to maintain the valuable social connections between students that would otherwise be provided in school settings.”Learn More:To see the list of COVID-19 primary hospital facilities, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded at: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-health questions about COVID-19 call 1-888-COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For a full listing of provincial health officer orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities:\\non Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\non Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews\\non Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCTranslations:For a Chinese translation:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.30_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfFor a Farsi translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.30_Joint-Statement_COVID19_FARSI.pdfFor a French translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.30_Joint-Statement-COVID19_FRENCH.pdfFor a Tagalog translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.30_Joint-Statement_COVID19_TAGALOG.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe protection of privacy is a top priority for the B.C. government, and so is protecting the health and safety of British Columbians during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.A new ministerial order under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA) enables the broader use of communications tools for health-care workers and other public-sector staff who are responding to the COVID-19 state of emergency. This order supports the people working on the front lines to protect the health and safety of British Columbians by ensuring they have access to vital software and technology that can help in this fight.The health and safety measures that provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has put in place throughout the province mean that:\\nK-12 schools are taking extended spring breaks and post-secondary institutions are moving in-person lectures to online platforms.\\nthousands of British Columbians are now staying at home with their loved ones and working remotely.\\nmost importantly, doctors, nurses, first responders and other front-line health-care providers are in urgent need of tools that will help them improve their ability to share information quickly and respond effectively to emerging needs.\\nThe public-health emergency has made it necessary for government to temporarily enable the use of technologies that would otherwise be restricted under FOIPPA’s current rules. The global pandemic has changed how the Province, health-care providers and organizations in the broader public sector are working. It has affected the way they need to deliver the services and supports that British Columbians count on.British Columbia has the strictest privacy and data-residency laws in Canada. It is one of only two Canadian provinces with legislation requiring the personal information of its citizens to be stored in and only accessed from within Canada. The ministerial order temporarily permits health-care bodies like the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, and health authorities to use communication and collaboration software that may host information outside of Canada. The order also enables B.C. schools and post-secondary institutions to provide online learning for students who have been displaced due to the need for physical distancing.The ministerial order is in effect until June 30, 2020. The Province will work with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner on or before this date to either rescind or renew the order, depending on the pandemic landscape at that time.Quick Facts:FOIPPA makes public bodies more accountable to the public and protects personal privacy by:\\ngiving the public a right of access to records;\\ngiving individuals a right of access to, and a right to request correction of, personal information about themselves;\\nspecifying limited exceptions to the rights of access;\\npreventing the unauthorized collection, use or disclosure of personal information by public bodies; and\\nproviding for an independent review of decisions made under this act.\\nThe act does not replace other procedures for access to information or in any way limit access to information that is not personal information and is available to the public.Learn More:To see the ministerial order, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/services-policies-for-government/information-management-technology/information-privacy/resources/ministerial_order_085_respecting_disclosures_during_covid-19_emergency__march_2020_pdf.pdfFreedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act in B.C.: http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96165_00\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAs the challenges caused by the COVID-19 outbreak continue to shift, the B.C. government and Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer (PHO), are taking unprecedented measures to slow the transmission of COVID-19, including in the retail food\\xa0and grocery store sector.Recently, Henry issued an order under the Public Health Act prohibiting the gathering of people in excess of 50 people at a place of which a person is the owner, occupier or operator, or for which they are otherwise responsible. Employers in the retail food and grocery store sector are asking for clarity about what this means for them.Retail food and grocery stores play an essential service in every community by ensuring safe and reliable access to food, supplies and other provisions.Many retail food and grocery store owners have asked whether or not the PHO’s order prohibiting mass gatherings of 50 or more people applies to them. While this order does not directly apply to the retail food and grocery industry, the spirit of the order should be followed. This means that, for example, in large grocery stores where it is feasible to have more than 50 people present at one time, it is permissible to do so provided that appropriate physical distancing can be maintained.A link to specific guidance is available in the Learn More section. Key considerations include:\\nenhancing the premise’s sanitation plan and schedule, and ensuring staff are practising proper hygiene. This includes frequent hand washing, only coughing or sneezing into an elbow, and avoiding touching one’s face;\\nplacing hand sanitizer with a minimum of 60% ethyl alcohol in dispensers near doors, pay stations and other high-touch locations for customer and staff use;\\nensuring washrooms are always well stocked with liquid soap and paper towels, and that warm running water is available;\\nproviding clean carry-out bags for purchased food and grocery products; customers should not use their own containers, reusable bags or boxes;\\nposting signs at each check-out indicating that no customer packaging is to be used or placed on check-out counters;\\nensuring cones or tape markers are in place every two metres to provide customers with visible queues that support physical distancing;\\nusing physical queue-line controls, such as crowd control cordons at entrances and in check-out lines outside the stores;\\ndo not sell bulk items, except via gravity feed bins or where staff dispense the bulk items;\\nself-isolation can end 14 days after the last contact or return to Canada if you have not developed symptoms; and\\nwith or without a history of travel, if you\\xa0have respiratory symptoms that can be managed at home,\\xa0self-isolate at home for at least 10 days after onset of symptoms.\\xa0After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you\\xa0feel better, you can return to your\\xa0routine activities.\\nCoughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.\\n\\nEmployers should reassess their work environment every day and keep updated with the information posted on the Province’s website: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The B.C. government is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19.

       "  '\\n\\nTo support vulnerable British Columbians during the COVID-19 crisis, the Province is providing a $3-million emergency grant from the Community Gaming Grants program to Food Banks British Columbia.Food Banks British Columbia will distribute the money among food banks provincewide to support their immediate needs to buy and distribute food, pay employees and cover other costs essential to the delivery of their food programs. Food Banks BC was selected to distribute the funding because of its expertise in management of food distribution.“We know that many British Columbia families count on food banks to supplement their weekly grocery needs. To help ensure that people continue to have access to the food they need, our government is taking steps by supporting B.C. food banks so they can, in turn, keep meeting the needs of the people in the communities they serve,” said Mable Elmore, Parliamentary Secretary for Poverty Reduction. “Using funds from the gaming grants program is an example of how government and non-profit partners are working together to respond to the evolving nature of the pandemic, easing the burden on B.C.’s food banks and helping people who are feeling the strain of the COVID-19 crisis.”Food Banks BC will assess the needs and requirements of food banks to determine the amount and timing of the distribution. Funds will be distributed quickly and equitably to food banks across all regions of the province.\\xa0“British Columbia’s not-for-profit food banks provide a critical service for vulnerable people in our communities, especially during this most challenging time,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “During times like these, we need to help each other as much as possible. This community gaming grant will help relieve hunger and provide support for the people in our province who need it most.”The $3-million grant uses\\xa0funding that remained in the Community Gaming Grant’s 2019-20 budget of $140 million after all 2019 community gaming grants had been awarded to or approved for eligible organizations.\\n\\n“This grant will make a tremendous impact in communities all over B.C. and ensure that food banks can keep their doors open and continue to meet the needs of the vulnerable, who particularly need their assistance at this time,” said Laura Lansink, executive director, Food Banks BC. “We sincerely thank the Province for this encouraging and vital assistance to Food Banks BC.”\\n\\nThe grant to Food Banks BC is in alignment with the ministerial order issued March 26, 2020, under the Emergency Program Act, to protect B.C.’s most vulnerable, making it easier to support critical services for vulnerable people, like food banks and shelters.In response to concerns raised by food banks about capacity to respond to the urgent need in their communities, the order removes barriers to business to allow: drive-through and delivery opportunities, larger hampers, increased home delivery capability\\xa0and removes the requirement to present identification. These measures will make it easier for food banks to operate in this challenging time when more people are using their services.This is one in a series of ministerial orders to ensure a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 across all levels of government for the duration of the provincial emergency.These latest steps are part of government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.Quick Facts:\\nFood Banks BC is B.C.’s provincial association of food banks that represents and supports food banks across the province.\\nEvery year, commercial gaming generates revenue that the Government of B.C. invests in key services.\\nThese investments support organizations in the areas of health care and education, arts and culture groups, sports, environment, public safety, human and social services, as well as parent advisory councils in schools throughout B.C.\\n\\nUp to $140 million of the revenue generated is directed into the community through the Community Gaming Grants program that supports about 5,000 community organizations each year.\\nLearn More:Food Banks BC: https://www.foodbanksbc.com/Community Gaming Grants: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/sports-culture/gambling-fundraising/gaming-grants/community-gaming-grantsState of Provincial Emergency: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PSSG0020-000568B.C.’s COVID Action Plan and other government resources and updates: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nMarch 27, 2020Ottawa, ON -\\xa0The Honourable Bernadette Jordan, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coast Guard and Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture for British Columbia, issued the following joint statement:“During these unprecedented times, it is more important than ever that we work together across all orders of government to keep Canadians safe and communities supported. Today, we spoke for the second time in recent days, to discuss the rapidly evolving COVID-19 impacts on the fish and seafood industry in British Columbia.Harvesters, seafood growers, and processors, are essential to our collective food security and to coastal communities up and down the Pacific. We spoke about the need to maintain the supply chain while ensuring the health and safety of the essential workers who support it. Your health is of paramount importance to us.We discussed industry concerns regarding fluctuating markets, financial losses, and the economic measures being put forward by the federal government to address some of those concerns. The small business measures – including additional liquidity from Business Development Bank of Canada and up to 75% wage subsidy for eligible employers – will help local businesses stay afloat and keep people on staff throughout this public health crisis. In addition, the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be there for people who can’t go out and fish or who have no earnings as a result of COVID-19’s impact on the market.Seafood growers, shellfish farmers, and processors, will have access to the $5 billion Farm Credit Canada loan program announced earlier this week by federal minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau.The B.C. government is going to support the British Columbian families who make their living from seafood during this pandemic and in the recovery process that follows. There are a number of programs the B.C. Government is working on to support all B.C. businesses and employees through these difficult days. The Ministry of Agriculture’s core programming that helps B.C. fish, shellfish and marine plant producers with local and international marketing efforts, clean technology and projects that promote habitat restoration will also continue, so people can continue to enjoy high-quality B.C. seafood now and for generations to come.We know there is more to do, and we will continue to collaborate, to meet weekly, and to work together to weather this storm. Know that we are working around the clock to support your livelihoods in the short term and ensure a strong recovery in the long term.”Associated links:\\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) - Information for industry (dfo-mpo.gc.ca) \\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nNew guidelines for school leaders and a new website are being introduced to support B.C.’s K-12 students while in-class education is suspended to prevent the spread of COVID-19.“This is a challenging time for families in B.C. as we work together to stop the spread of COVID-19, but it is vital students have a sense of routine and continued opportunities to learn while they are at home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “These guidelines will ensure the needs, health and safety of students are put first as school leaders actively plan to serve the unique needs of their communities.”While in-person classes are suspended, the B.C. school system remains open to continue to support students and families in a variety of ways. Note that parents should not bring their children to school on Monday, March 30, 2020, as they usually would after spring break.However, essential frontline health-care workers, like those directly involved in patient care, who need urgent care for their school-aged child the week of March 30 are advised to contact their school principal as soon as possible to discuss care arrangements available during the first week back after spring break. Other parents who are deemed an essential service worker and who may need child care for their school-age children can expect to hear from their school regarding care options by Friday, April 3, 2020. Schools will be doing their best to accommodate urgent child care needs while meeting the guidelines and directives of the provincial health officer.Since there are many students who will have challenges working online, schools have been directed to look at alternative approaches for continued learning that will fit with the individual needs and circumstances of their communities. School leaders are actively working on these plans, and families will hear from their school superintendent and/or school principal in the coming week with an update on their timelines.Government is working with all 60 school boards, independent school authorities, First Nations schools, teachers, school leaders, support staff, public health officials and all education partners on a co-ordinated approach. Guidelines for developing education plans for students will follow these principles:\\n\\nMaintain a healthy and safe environment for all students, families and employees.\\nProvide the services needed to support children of essential workers.\\nSupport vulnerable students who may need special assistance.\\nProvide continuity of educational opportunities for all students.\\n\\nThese principles will also guide planning and support for students who need extra learning support or those with disabilities, important services like meal programs and child care services operating on school grounds.\\n“Boards of education across the province are working on ways to ensure continuity of learning in their communities,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “Local boards of education understand the unique needs in each community. That local connection will be key as boards roll out plans tailored to each school district in the province.”\\nWhile teachers and schools will have primary responsibility for continuous learning, government has launched Keep Learning BC. This is a central place where families can find ideas for everyday educational activities, annotated links to free learning resources, as well as how to help children learn and how to ensure their well-being while they are at home. Keep Learning BC is available at: www.openschool.bc.ca/keeplearning/\\nThe Keep Learning BC website will have helpful guides to maintain routines and stay safe online, giving parents information about how talk to their children about COVID-19, along with other mental health resources to manage stress or anxiety. A comprehensive set of frequently asked questions is also available, with continuous updates about school services and programs as things progress: www.gov.bc.ca/safeschools/\\nFleming added, “While it’s important for kids to keep learning, there is no expectation that we can duplicate a normal school day at home, and every family will need to figure out what works best for them, in discussion with their children’s teachers. I understand that many children are experiencing anxiety, while also missing their teachers and friends, and that’s why it’s important they know the actions we’re taking are designed to keep everyone safe, and we will return to regular school life down the road. By working together and supporting each other, we will get through this.”\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, said, “We are proud of the parents, families and school communities who are working together to keep their children safely at home, and recognize how important it is for children to have continued learning opportunities in these challenging times. Parents who are health-care workers are also eagerly waiting for support, and it’s our job to work as a team to make sure they can continue their essential services.”\\nQuote:\\nAndrea Sinclair, president, BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils\\xa0—\\n“The BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils is truly appreciative of the united effort that is being undertaken across the education sector resulting in the continuity of an educational program while our children are at home. Parents understand that alternative instruction plans are being created to best meet the needs of children and that learning will vary by grade, district and region. As we try to maintain a daily routine in our homes, including academics and recreation, parents acknowledge that educators play a critical role supporting our children during this extraordinary time.”\\nQuick Facts:\\n\\nOn March 17, 2020, under the direction of the provincial health officer, all schools were ordered to immediately suspend in-class instruction until further notice.\\xa0\\nEvery student in K-12 will receive a final mark for the 2019-20 school year, and all students who are on track to move to the next grade will do so in the fall. Every student eligible to graduate from Grade 12 this school year will also graduate. On average, about 45,000 students graduate every year.\\nThe Ministry of Education is also working across government to ensure all students graduating high school will have a smooth transition to post-secondary education.\\nLearn More:Students, parents, guardians and teachers can find learning resources and accurate, timely information about schools, programs and educational services, including regularly updated frequently asked questions\\xa0at: www.gov.bc.ca/SafeSchools/A new website is constantly being updated with the latest information: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The best source of COVID-19 health information can be found at the BC Centre for Disease Control website:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/For non-health-related questions, please visit www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19, email servicebc@gov.bc.ca, or call 1 888 COVID-19For those who think they have symptoms of COVID-19, the Ministry of Health has developed an online self-assessment tool at: https://covid19.thrive.health\\nPeople with symptoms can also call 811 to pre-arrange health testing.If children are struggling with a problem big or small, encourage them to call the Kids Help Line, a free resource available at 1 800 668-6868.Translations:For a traditional Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Continued_Learning_during_COVID19_Mar27.Chinese.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_March27_Continued_Learning_during_COVID_Punjabi.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian\\xa0Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 67 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 792 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 391 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 262 are in the Fraser Health region, 57 are in the Island Health region, 70 are in the Interior Health region and 12 are in the Northern Heath region.“We are saddened to report two more deaths as a result of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal health region. Our condolences to their loved ones during this difficult time.“Two additional long-term care homes in the Fraser Health region have staff with confirmed cases of COVID-19, The Harrison at Elim Village and Chartwell Independent Living at Langley Gardens. In total, 11 long-term care homes in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions have confirmed cases of COVID-19. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols.“Two hundred and seventy-five patients with COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 73 individuals are currently hospitalized, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We are tracking the epidemic curve closely here in B.C. We are also monitoring outbreaks in other nations to guide our health system preparations and public health response.“In the past few days, our upward path has been less severe than other places, but we continue to see steady increases in community transmission cases and continue to be concerned about outbreaks, which could quickly grow and challenge our pandemic response.“The evidence is clear: with every person in British Columbia 100% committed to physical distancing, we can flatten the curve. Over the next two weeks we must be united in this one goal.“We strongly discourage any in-person gathering of any size at this time, but rather encourage using the many online options we have available today to stay connected to friends, family, customers and clients.“We know that our community and farmers markets are an important source of fresh food. We are heartened that, with the support of funding from the provincial government, many markets are shifting to an online model. We remind market organizers that a public gathering order is in place and physical distancing measures must be followed.“Further, to reduce the potential for transmission and ensure local, B.C.-grown food can continue to reach customers, a provincial health officer order has been issued, effective immediately.“All occasional/recurring/weekly events where food and other merchandise is sold (e.g., markets, street markets, night markets, Saturday markets or community markets) must only allow vendors that sell food to be at these events. Vendors of non-food items and all other merchandise are prohibited to sell at these events.“Every day that we stay home and stay apart will bolster our COVID-19 response. This is how we will protect our health-care workers, whose job it is to care for us, our loved ones and ourselves.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded at: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-medical questions about COVID-19, call 1 888 COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For a full listing of provincial health officer orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\nOr:\\xa0https://twitter.com/BCGovNewsToday’s epidemiological technical briefing data is available at: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_TechnicalBriefing_Mar27_2020.pdfFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.27_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nGovernment liquor stores remain open in order to continue serving British Columbians, while also ensuring the safety of the most vulnerable people, employees and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.BC Liquor Stores (BCLS) are adjusting hours of operation, in part, to ensure BCLS staff complete additional store cleaning in the off hours, in order to minimize risk to both employees and customers and help stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The number of customers permitted in stores will also be limited, where required, in order to allow for observance of the self-distancing guidelines outlined by the provincial health officer and the Ministry of Health.Additionally, while there is no shortage of beer, wine and spirits in B.C., an increase in sales and customers has led to challenges in keeping shelves properly stocked. The adjusted hours will allow staff to ensure products are available for customers at a time when stores have been experiencing staffing shortages.In addition, if landlords or shopping malls are limiting hours, the Liquor Distribution Branch will be required to reduce operating hours accordingly.As the situation evolves, the government continues to explore additional temporary measures to support the hospitality industry. New opportunities will be communicated with the public as they become available.Learn More:COVID-19 BC government web page: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19BC Liquor Stores: http://www.bcliquorstores.com/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Les organismes du secteur se sont immédiatement conformés aux ordonnances, aux directives et aux recommandations de la directrice provinciale de la santé publique et ont su faire preuve d’un leadership exemplaire en annulant des événements, des spectacles et des festivals afin de protéger la santé du public. Nous sommes conscients que ces décisions ont eu des conséquences importantes pour les artistes, leurs familles et les organismes du milieu.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Mon collègue Bob D’Eith, député de la circonscription de Maple Ridge-Mission et moi-même avons eu des entretiens réguliers avec les dirigeants du milieu des arts et de la culture afin de bien comprendre leurs besoins immédiats au cours de cette pandémie.\\xa0Dans le but d’aider les gens et les organismes du secteur, nous avons créé un fonds de soutien de 3\\xa0millions de dollars pour la résilience du secteur des arts et de la culture, qui sera administré par le BC\\xa0Arts Council. Dès le début d’avril, ce fonds permettra aux clients en activité et aux projets admissibles de bénéficier d’un supplément pouvant aller jusqu’à 15\\u2009000\\xa0dollars pour les aider dans le paiement de leurs factures courantes.\\xa0 \\xa0À compter d’avril 2020, le BC Arts Council versera à ses clients en activité une avance équivalant à 50\\xa0% du financement qui leur avait été accordé pour 2020-2021 afin de les aider à disposer de plus de liquidités. Nous reporterons également les dates limites de dépôt des demandes, assouplirons les exigences de production de rapports et permettrons aux organismes d’utiliser leur financement pour couvrir les dépenses urgentes comme le paiement du loyer ou des services publics. \\xa0\\xa0Ces mesures s’ajoutent au plan d’action de notre gouvernement pour la COVID-19. La nouvelle prestation d’urgence pour les travailleurs, la BC Emergency Benefit for Workers, permettra aussi aux personnes œuvrant dans le secteur des arts et dont le revenu a été affecté par la pandémie de COVID‑19 de déposer une demande afin de recevoir une prestation unique de 1\\u2009000\\xa0dollars. Le plan de soutien financier de notre gouvernement comprend plusieurs mesures auxquelles les organismes du secteur des arts sont admissibles, notamment le report des dates limites pour l’envoi de déclarations de revenus ou de paiements. \\xa0\\xa0Il s’agit là d’une première étape hautement nécessaire. Ces mesures regroupent ce que nous pouvons faire maintenant, dans le cadre du budget existant du BC Arts Council, pour aider les organismes du secteur des arts au cours de la pandémie.

These markets are eligible to receive funding to help transition to an online market platform. This will enable them to continue selling their food products to customers in their communities.“The critical importance and resiliency of local food and farmers has never been clearer than now, and B.C. farmers markets are an essential retail sales channel for British Columbians to access local food and sustain the livelihoods of thousands of farmers and food processors across our province,” said Heather O’Hara, executive director, BCAFM. “Our member farmers markets continue to modify their operations to ensure the health and safety of customers, vendors and market organizers alike, and in further response to COVID-19, our new BC Farmers’ Markets Online platform will offer a new shopping channel for the peak farmers market season this summer.”British Columbians can find a farmers market near them and see which markets have launched online operations in the weeks and months ahead at: https://bcfarmersmarkettrail.com/The B.C. government is providing $55,000 to the BCAFM to cover fees for individual farmers markets to join the online platform and set up their digital market store presence. Each participating farmers market will create its own virtual market store to best serve its communities.The funding is part of the Ministry of Agriculture’s Buy BC program. Buy BC helps farmers, ranchers and producers market their products as locally grown, raised, harvested or produced, making it easy for British Columbians to Buy BC.Learn More:As they open, information about active BC Farmers’ Markets Online will be added to: https://bcfarmersmarkettrail.com/\\nThis website will also have up-to-date information on the markets operating in the community.More about Buy BC: https://buybc.gov.bc.ca/Apply to be a member of the BCAFM: https://bcfarmersmarket.org/membership/farmers-market-membership/For an example of an online farmers market, visit: https://www.localline.ca/click-forkA backgrounder follows.\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

This is an important step to keep these workers safe and keep goods moving.“We have also provided clinical guidelines to support patients receiving withdrawal treatment that will assist them in self-isolating and help protect their community from COVID-19 transmission.“We are encouraged by the Government of Canada’s decision to put a mandatory 14-day quarantine in place for all travellers entering Canada, and we are reminding people in B.C. about the 14- and 10-day requirements we already have in place here.“The March 17 provincial health officer order mandates that anyone in B.C. who has travelled anywhere outside of Canada must self-isolate for 14 days on their return.“Equally important, if you are presumed or confirmed positive for COVID-19, you are required to self-isolate for 10 days from the onset of symptoms.“Every day that we stay home and stay apart, while still staying connected to friends and loved ones, will bolster our COVID-19 response. You can connect with friends online, you can share stories about your day through photos and videos, and you can make a difference.“We need everyone to be 100% committed now, next week and next month.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded at: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-medical\\xa0questions about COVID-19, call 1-888-COVID-19 or visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For a full listing of provincial health officer orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\nOn Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\nOn Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNewsFor a traditional Chinese translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.26_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nTo help reduce the risks to people who use substances, the Province has announced new clinical guidance, effective immediately, for health-care providers to stem the spread of COVID-19 and respond to the ongoing overdose emergency.The provincial clinical guidance incorporates the federal government’s recent exemptions to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The dual public health emergencies present unprecedented risks for vulnerable and at-risk people, including safely responding to overdoses related to the increasingly toxic drug supply and withdrawal for those who must self-isolate or quarantine to prevent the spread of COVID-19.“We’re dealing with one public health emergency on top of another, and the challenges are unlike anything we’ve ever seen,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Physical distancing is not easy when you are living in poverty, visiting a clinic every day to get your medicine and relying on an unpredictable, illegal drug supply. This guidance will make it easier for at-risk people to meet the requirements of distancing while avoiding other serious risks to their health and to the health of the community.”The guidance supports people who are at risk of COVID-19 infection, people who have a confirmed infection or a suspected case pending diagnosis and people who have a history of substance use, including opioids, stimulants, alcohol, benzodiazepines or tobacco.To reduce the risk of transmission, the guidance outlines steps that prescribers, pharmacists and care teams can take to support the provision of medications – including safe prescription alternatives to the illegal drug supply – to be delivered directly to patients, along with telemedicine for clinical assessments.Further, these guidelines indicate the use of prescription alternatives in addition to existing treatment options to prevent the risk associated with the toxic drug supply.“This response is urgently needed to support people who use substances, their families and health care providers,” said Cheyenne Johnson, co-interim executive director, BC Centre on Substance Use. “As the effects of the pandemic continue to unfold, the illicit drug supply is likely to become significantly more adulterated and toxic. Coupled with directions to self-isolate or quarantine and risk potentially dangerous withdrawal as a result, people who use substances are especially vulnerable to the harms of these dual health emergencies.”People who use substances and who have an existing general practitioner or nurse practitioner are encouraged to work with them to access these new supports. Others can contact a rapid access addiction clinic, some of which are equipped to provide telehealth support, consultation for prescribers and patient assessment.While isolating, patients are encouraged to use harm-reduction best practices to prevent overdoses, including practicing safer drug use, buddying up while maintaining a two-metre separation and carrying a naloxone kit.The guidance was developed by the BC Centre on Substance Use with a provincial working group of addiction medicine clinicians\\xa0and people with lived and living experience, and was reviewed by Ministry of Health, Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, Office of the Provincial Health Officer and First Nations Health Authority. It has also been reviewed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC, College of Pharmacists of BC and BC College of Nursing Professionals.Learn More: To read the guidance, visit: www.bccsu.ca/covid-19\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAs part of British Columbia’s emergency novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response plan, the Province is providing the United Way of the Lower Mainland with $50 million to bolster seniors’ supports at community service agencies throughout British Columbia.This will help address immediate needs associated with the impact of COVID-19, so seniors get the support they need to stay safe at home. \\xa0The supports are the outcome of work conducted by an all-party COVID-19 Seniors Working Group co-chaired by Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors advocate, and the ministry. Members of the working group are Ronna-Rae Leonard, MLA for Courtenay-Comox; Janet Routledge, MLA for Burnaby North; Shirley Bond, MLA for Prince George-Valemount; John Yap, MLA for Richmond-Steveston; and Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley.“This is a trying time for all of us, but especially for seniors across B.C.,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “I am so proud and appreciative of the work that the seniors advocate and all members of the Seniors Working Group have done to build a plan for safely supporting seniors at home and in community through the COVID-19 pandemic.”The Province is funding the expansion of bc211, a provincewide information and referral service, to match seniors whose support network has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak with volunteers.Starting today, bc211 will be available to residents of B.C.’s North and Interior, in addition to the rest of B.C., and provide extended hours of service. This service will take calls from people who would like to\\xa0volunteer to help seniors in their community with basic needs, including grocery shopping and pharmacy drop-offs and check-ins.“Seniors in B.C. are especially vulnerable to the impact COVID-19 will have on their health and their ability to stay connected with others,” Mackenzie said. \"The outpouring of calls from people who want to help our seniors is inspiring, and using bc211 to match British Columbians who want to help, with seniors who need some help to stay connected and meet basic needs, is a perfect match.”The funding provided to the United Way of the Lower Mainland will\\xa0address\\xa0immediate needs associated with the impact of COVID-19, as well as\\xa0maintain and expand some existing programs.“We’re excited to be collaborating with bc211 and the Ministry of Health to deliver these essential supports to seniors,” said Michael McKnight, president and CEO, United Way of the Lower Mainland. “It is important that we support our most vulnerable citizens during this challenging time with local communities and community agencies being essential to these efforts. If you are a senior in need of support, we urge you to reach out.”Improving access to local support for seniors includes expanding current services and addressing both geographic and capacity gaps, to better serve seniors locally during this crucial time.Quick Facts:\\nIn 2019, 20% of B.C.’s population was 65 years of age or older. In 15 years, this percentage is expected to rise to 25%.\\nThe information and referral service will gather information and share it with participating local community agencies that will match seniors and volunteers who live in the same community.\\nThe phone service will be available seven days a week during daytime hours and is free.\\nLearn More:To learn more about bc211, visit: http://www.bc211.ca/\\xa0\\xa0To learn more about United Way Better at Home Program, visit: http://betterathome.ca/Seniors and people who want to volunteer and who are well can call bc211 or visit: www.bc211.ca/To learn more about the benefits of volunteering, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/family-social-supports/seniors/health-safety/active-aging/volunteeringFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Seniors-211-support_COVID-19_Chinese.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nConstruction continues on the Highway 4 Kennedy Hill Safety Improvement Project, with the project currently at 60% complete.However, due to a variety of factors, the project will not be completed in summer 2020 as originally scheduled.Factors affecting the completion date include the fast-evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the need for more complex blasts due to variable rock, increased environmental protections and the repairs to Highway 4 resulting from blasting damage at the project site in January.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was anticipated that final paving would take place in fall 2020, with completion in this coming winter due to the necessary blasting and repair work. However, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure acknowledges the possibility of more delays as a result of the developing situation with COVID-19. The ministry and the contractor are committed to working together to mitigate any schedule delays.Blasting on site continues to be the key activity. Once the rock bluffs have been lowered to highway grade in the next few months, the contractor will be able to shorten highway closures. This will improve access for residents and visitors.The excavation at this project site has been particularly complex. Design adjustments have been made to reduce the amount of rock and earth removed by about 130,000 cubic metres. Three cantilever bridge structures will be added, and the new rest area will now be located on the lake side of the highway. These adjustments will help reduce project risk associated with blasting without requiring further schedule extension.The Highway 4 Kennedy Hill Safety Improvement Project will create a safer and more reliable connection between Port Alberni and the west coast of Vancouver Island.The ministry thanks area residents and other people who rely on the highway for their patience and understanding during construction and the changing schedule. \\xa0Learn More:To listen to the travel information hotline message, updated daily during construction, call 1 855 451-7152.General project information and traffic schedules are available at: www.gov.bc.ca/highway4kennedyhillVisit the project page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eac.bc.ca.kennedy.hill/Follow @DriveBC and #BCHwy4 on Twitter or visit: www.drivebc.caFor more information on the emergency support hubs for commercial truck drivers, recreational vehicles and campers, contact Pacific Rim National Park Reserve at 250 726-3524.Guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19 is available at: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EMBC0002-000542\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The Province continues to recognize First Nations’ states of emergency, and to support First Nations in managing COVID-19 through agencies including Emergency Management BC and First Nations Health Authority.\\nSome First Nations under their local states of emergency have issued travel restrictions related to non-essential travel into their communities, and the Province respects these emergency declarations.\\nAt this time, the Province is not issuing orders that affect travel into or out of First Nations communities. The Province will work to support First Nations if they seek to assert measures they deem necessary regarding travel restrictions in the coming days.\\nThe provincial health officer recommends against all non-essential travel at this time in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19.\\nFirst Nations Health Authority, Emergency Management BC and Indigenous Services Canada have been working with First Nations to secure essential supplies and equipment for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. The interests of First Nations and Indigenous communities and organizations will continue to be an essential part of the work of the new Provincial Supply Chain Coordination Unit.\\nThe suite of emergency orders was issued March 26, 2020, by the minister of public safety and solicitor general under the Emergency Program Act.\\nIn early 2019, the provincial government initiated work on modernizing this emergency management legislation. To date, there has been extensive Indigenous engagement on proposed changes, including five regional Indigenous engagement sessions with more than 80 participants from over 60 First Nations.\\nEmergency Management BC is taking that feedback to further refine this work. The Province will ensure ongoing involvement of Indigenous peoples as the new legislation is developed, in keeping with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.\\nEmergency Management BC is holding regular regional public health co-ordination calls on COVID-19 for local governments and First Nations across all regions.

       "  \"\\n\\nMike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, is using extraordinary powers under a state of provincial emergency to keep British Columbians safe, maintain essential goods and services, and support the Province’s ongoing response to novel coronavirus\\xa0(COVID-19).“B.C. is in a strong position to effectively respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Farnworth. “Informed by the direction of the provincial health officer, we’re taking these critical steps to keep our communities safe, goods moving and essential service workers supported.”Using the extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act, the minister is issuing a series of ministerial orders to ensure a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 across all levels of government for the duration of the provincial emergency. These include:\\nSupply chain: Establishing a new Provincial Supply Chain Coordination Unit to co-ordinate goods and services distribution; taking a more active role in co-ordinating essential goods and services movement by land, air, marine and rail; and suspending any bylaws that restrict goods delivery at any time of day.\\nProtecting consumers: Banning the secondary resale of food, medical supplies, personal protective equipment, cleaning and other essential supplies; and restricting quantities of items purchased at point of sale.\\xa0\\nEnforcement: Enabling municipal bylaw officers to support enforcement of the provincial health officer’s orders for business closures and gatherings, in line with offences under the Public Health Act.\\nTravel: Ensuring all passenger and car-ferry services provide minimum service levels and priority access for residents, and essential goods and workers.\\nProtecting B.C.’s most vulnerable: Making it easier to support critical services for vulnerable people, like food banks and shelters.\\nCo-ordination: Suspending\\xa0local states of emergency specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, except for the City of Vancouver; giving municipal councils the ability to hold more flexible meetings to expedite decisions; and co-ordinating potential use of local publicly owned facilities, like community centres, for self-isolation, testing, medical care, warehousing and distribution.\\nThese unprecedented steps, made based on the recommendation of B.C.’s health and emergency management officials and invoked for the first time under a provincial state of emergency, will support the provincial health officer and minister of health in a co-ordinated cross-government approach to COVID-19 response and recovery.Farnworth added, “Many local governments, First Nations and partners have stepped up to make sure they have prepared to protect their communities from the impacts of COVID-19. Today’s measures will make sure communities are taking necessary steps, in co-ordination with the Province, to get ready should more action be required to combat COVID-19.”The Province, in consultation with the Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, has defined essential services British Columbians rely on in their daily lives in the context of COVID-19 response and recovery. This is distinct from essential service designations under the Province's\\xa0Labour Relations Code.In consultation with the provincial health officer, any business or service that has not been ordered to close, and is also not identified on the essential service list, may stay open if it can adapt its services and workplace to the orders and recommendations of the PHO.“In these new and challenging times we are facing, we’re asking British Columbians to stay strong as a community, and together we can get through this,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “I’m proud of the strategic measures we have enacted government-wide to help our families and health-care workers, to keep them safe and supported. By issuing a series of ministerial orders, we recognize that this is not forever,\\xa0but it is for now. With everyone stepping in and respecting the extraordinary means we have to take, we will overcome this.”Farnworth declared a provincial state of emergency on March 18, 2020, after the provincial health officer declared a public health emergency on March 17. The Province previously declared states of emergency in 1998, 2003, 2017 and 2018 – all related to wildfires. In each of those previous declarations, necessary actions were able to be taken without issuing minister’s orders under the Emergency Program Act.Quick Facts:\\nDeclarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.\\nThe provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time.\\nDuring the 2017 wildfire season, the Province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.\\nLearn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, including for employers and businesses, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For the COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and planning materials, visit:\\xa0https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/pandemic-influenza.For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/For more information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19For a Punjabi translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Province-takes-unprecedented-steps_COVID19_Punjabi.pdfFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Province-takes_unprecendented-steps_COVID19_Chinese.pdfFor a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Province-takes-unprecedented-steps_COVID19_French.pdfFor a Tagalog translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_EPA_NR_0326-TAGALOG.pdfFor a Farsi translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_EPA_NR_0326_FARSI.pdfTwo backgrounders follow.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 42 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 659 cases in British Columbia.“One additional residential care home now has a confirmed case – a health-care worker at the Broadway Pentecostal Lodge in the Vancouver Coastal health region. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols.“It is with sadness we share that one more resident of the Lynn Valley Care Centre has passed away. That brings us to a total of 14 people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19. We extend our condolences to their loved ones.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 339 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 218 are in the Fraser Health region, 47 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 46 are in the Interior Health region and nine are in the Northern Heath region.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 64 individuals are currently hospitalized, 26 of those in hospital are in intensive care and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“One hundred and eighty-three patients with COVID-19 are now considered fully recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“An order is in place prohibiting gatherings larger than 50 people. This is not an order of convenience, but a requirement to protect everyone in our province – especially our elders and those most vulnerable to severe illness – from COVID-19.“We remind all British Columbians that while 50 is the maximum number, the smaller, the better. Community connection is very important during this challenging time, but it must be done safely, either virtually or with physical distance. Celebrations and ceremonies that bring many people together, including our elders and seniors, need to be postponed.“With enhanced cleaning and physical distancing precautions in place, we can keep everyone safe and keep many businesses, including all the essential services we need, going.“There are a number of new resources and tools available to help British Columbians who may have questions about COVID-19. Together, we can make a difference.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19 and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The self-assessment app can be downloaded at: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-health questions about COVID-19, call 1 888 COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities:\\nOn Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0\\nOn Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNewsFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.25_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nTo support people and prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Province is introducing a new temporary rental supplement, halting evictions and freezing rents, among other actions. \\xa0The new rental supplement will help households by offering up to $500 a month towards their rent, building on federal and provincial financial supports already announced for British Columbians facing financial hardship.“With lost jobs and lost wages due to COVID-19, many tenants are worried they can’t make the rent. It’s a challenging time for landlords too,” said Premier John Horgan. “Nobody should lose their home as a result of COVID-19. Our plan will give much-needed financial relief to renters and landlords. It will also provide more security for renters, who will be able to stay in their homes without fear of eviction or increasing rents during this emergency.”The funds will support renters experiencing a loss of income by helping them pay their rent and will be paid directly to landlords on their behalf, to ensure landlords continue to receive rental income during the pandemic. Benefiting people with low to moderate incomes, this supplement will be available to renters who are facing financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, but do not qualify for existing rental assistance programs.“People are feeling a lot of fear and anxiety and they need to be able to depend on\\xa0the comfort and stability of home\\xa0right now. Our government is taking steps to help take some of the pressure off renters and landlords and protect people’s health,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We’re helping renters pay rent and giving them the peace of mind that they have a stable home in these unprecedented times, and ensuring that landlords can count on some rental income right now to keep them afloat too.”Spencer Chandra Herbert, MLA for Vancouver-West End, who led the Province’s Rental Housing Task Force, consulted with a broad range of tenant and landlord organizations to inform the development of these actions that meet the needs of both landlords and tenants during the pandemic.“As we work together to fight this pandemic, we can’t afford to leave anyone behind,” Chandra Herbert said. “That’s why I delivered recommendations that address the immediate concerns of both landlords and tenants who are doing their best at this difficult time.”The Province is implementing a number of additional measures to keep people housed and protect their health. The full list of immediate measures includes:\\nThe new temporary rent supplement will provide up to $500 per month, paid directly to landlords.\\nHalting evictions by ensuring a landlord may not issue a new notice to end tenancy for any reason. However, in exceptional cases where it may be needed to protect health and safety or to prevent undue damage to the property, landlords will be able to apply to the Residential Tenancy Branch for a hearing.\\nHalting the enforcement of existing eviction orders issued by the Residential Tenancy Branch, except in extreme cases where there are safety concerns. The smaller number of court ordered evictions are up to the courts, which operate\\xa0independently of government.\\nFreezing new annual rent increases during the state of emergency.\\nPreventing landlords from accessing rental units without the consent of the tenant (for example, for showings or routine maintenance), except in exceptional cases where it is \\xa0needed to protect health and safety or to prevent undue damage to the unit.\\nRestricting methods that renters and landlords can use to serve notices to reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19 (no personal service and allowing email).\\nAllowing landlords to restrict the use of common areas by tenants or guests to protect against the transmission of COVID-19.\\nTo further support renters and landlords, the Residential Tenancy Branch will implement several additional actions, including adjourning and rescheduling hearings in situations where people need additional time to prepare and extending timelines for filing applications for dispute resolution.These latest steps are part of government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.Learn More:For information about the temporary rental supplement, including eligibility criteria, visit:\\xa0http://bchousing.org/bctrs\\nOr call 1 877 757-2577For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/\\nOr follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19\\nOr call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.Translations:For a French translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Renter-Landlord-Support_FR.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Renter-Landord-Supports_COVID-19__BG_Punjabi.pdfFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Rent_Support_COVID_Mar25_Chinese.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAs challenges caused by novel coronavirus\\xa0(COVID-19) continue to shift, the B.C. government and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO), are taking unprecedented measures to slow transmission.On March 16, 2020, Henry issued an order under the Public Health Act prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people.On March 18, 2020, the chief inspector of mines (CIM) communicated to all major mines, sand and gravel, and placer operations in B.C. with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further to the guidance provided by the CIM that all mines must follow the public health order, the PHO is directing all mines and smelters to take additional precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to their employees.While mine sites are not considered to be gatherings of more than 50 people, the PHO has provided the following directions for day-to-day production and site operations:\\nReduce the number of on-site personnel by encouraging work from home where feasible.\\nDaily pre-shift safety meetings (toolbox meetings) affecting more than 50 people are to be held in smaller numbers or via other media, such as by phone or video conferencing.\\nIn-person town-hall meetings used to address the whole site must be avoided for groups of more than 50 people. Communication should continue in smaller groups or via other means.\\nThere should be no more than 50 people in the same space in any circumstance. This includes common areas in bunkhouses and cafeterias.\\nWhere possible, employees should maintain a distance of two metres from each other. This distancing is as important outside of work hours as it is during work hours.\\nPost signage that limits the number of occupants in any elevator to four people at a time.\\nReduce in‐person meetings and gatherings. Where feasible, hold site meetings in open spaces or outside.\\nIncrease the number of handwashing stations.\\xa0Post signage that identifies their location.\\nMaintain a list of employees who are currently working on site. Update this list daily.\\nAll common areas and surfaces are to be cleaned as needed, and at the end of each shift. Examples include washrooms, shared offices, common tables, desks, light switches and door handles.\\nSelf-isolation can end 14 days after the last contact or return to Canada if you have not developed symptoms.\\nWith or without a history of travel, if you\\xa0have respiratory symptoms that can be managed at home,\\xa0self-isolate at home for at least 10 days after onset of symptoms.\\xa0After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you\\xa0feel better, you can return to your\\xa0routine activities.\\nCoughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.\\n\\nAnyone who has been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate at home for 14 days.\\nVisitors must be essential to the mine site’s operation.\\nThese requirements also pertain to transportation to and from mines. All employees are reminded to follow direction of the PHO regarding physical distancing when off site.Employers should reassess their work environment every day and keep up to date with the information posted on the Province’s COVID-19 website: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The B.C. government is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19.

Employers in the manufacturing sector are asking for clarity about what this means for them.The public health officer is directing employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes:\\nThere should be no more than 50 people in the same space in any circumstances.\\nEmployees must be able to maintain a distance of two metres apart from each other.\\nReduce in-person meetings and other gatherings and hold shop meetings in open spaces or outside.\\nIncrease the number of handwashing stations and post signage that identifies their location.

Where plumbed facilities are not feasible, employers must provide access to portable washroom and handwashing facilities. Those facilities must be maintained in good working order and be provided with the supplies necessary for their use.Employers should reassess their work environment every day and keep updated with the information posted on the Province’s COVID-19 website: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The B.C. government is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19.

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today,\\xa0we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: March 22 to 23,\\xa0and March 23 through to this morning.“In the first reporting period through March 23, 2020, we had 67 new cases, for a total of 539 cases in British Columbia.“In the last 24 hours, we have had 78 new cases, for a total of 617 cases in British Columbia.“This represents 145 new cases since we reported yesterday morning.“Two additional residential care homes have confirmed cases. One is a health-care worker at the Little Mountain Place residential care home in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, and one is a resident in Evergreen Heights assisted-living residence in the Fraser Health region. Public health officials are providing staff support to implement outbreak protocols.\\n\\n“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 330 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 194 are in the Fraser Health region, 44 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 41 are in the Interior Health region and eight are in the Northern Heath region.“In total, there have been 13 deaths from COVID-19 in British Columbia, in large part as a result of the clusters in long-term care homes.“We are very pleased to report that 28% of cases, or 173 individuals, have now recovered and are no longer in isolation.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 59 individuals are currently hospitalized, 23 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“As the escalating numbers across B.C. show us, there is circulation and risk of COVID-19 throughout British Columbia. While the majority of known cases are in the Lower Mainland, no community or individual is immune – whether in the North, on Vancouver Island, young or old.“We must remind ourselves that the virus can spread with minimal symptoms and that is why physical distancing,\\xa0especially staying away from people at higher risk,\\xa0is so critically important at this time.“Equally important is for all of us to know that, despite the challenges before us, our province and our country will get through this. Let’s continue to join together and support each other.“We continue to look to the World Health Organization, and other parts of the world with major outbreaks, to learn and adapt our response here in B.C. This is informing our strategy on testing and hospitalization.“To help British Columbians who may have questions about COVID-19 symptoms, yesterday we launched a self-assessment app. In the last 24 hours, 18,800 users have downloaded it. The online self assessment tool on the BC Centre for Disease Control website has also been used almost 2.5 million times since its launch last week.“Later this week, we will present our latest epidemiological modelling.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19,\\xa0and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The self-assessment app can be downloaded at: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-medical questions about COVID-19, call 1-888-COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities:\\non Facebook:\\xa0https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0\\non Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNewsFor a French translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_NR_COVID-19_BC_ActionPlan_FINAL_FR.pdfFor a Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.24_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nBC Parks continues to monitor whether people visiting provincial parks are complying with the physical distancing required to stop the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).Parks throughout British Columbia are seeing an increase in visitors, but many people are not complying with the provincial health officer’s (PHO) requirement for families and individuals to stay at least two metres away from others. This puts the most vulnerable populations at risk. BC Parks has heard concerns from the public, RCMP and First Nations, as well as regional and municipal governments about the increase in visitors and is implementing full closures of certain parks throughout the province.“The mental and physical wellness benefit of being outside during the COVID-19 pandemic response is important, but keeping people safe right now is the most important thing we can be doing,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Until we flatten the transmission curve of COVID-19 and people strictly comply with the PHO physical distancing requirement, provincial park access will be\\xa0restricted.”These closures are in addition to a previous suspension of services and facilities in provincial parks, including visitor centres, nature houses, washrooms and day-use areas. In alignment with Parks Canada, all campgrounds are closed until April 30, 2020.\\xa0\\xa0BC Parks will continue to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak closely and follow the direction and advice set out by the PHO and the Ministry of Health. Additional provincial park closures may be implemented on a case-by-case basis where and when required. People who still choose to visit provincial parks should be mindful that they are responsible for their own safety and that washroom facilities will not be available.In addition to the BC Parks closures, the Recreation Sites and Trails BC (RSTBC) branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development is closing its campgrounds and amenities in response to the COVID-19 situation.“We want to do whatever we can to make sure British Columbians have access to this province’s great outdoor recreation opportunities, but this is an unprecedented situation and we need to protect everyone’s health,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development.RSTBC campgrounds are generally located in remote areas and provide basic facilities. Potable water and electricity are not provided. The temporary closure includes RSTBC campgrounds where there is an increased likelihood of close contact with frequently touched surfaces, including toilets, kiosks, ticket booths, overnight shelters and day-use shelters. Day-use shelters, backcountry cabins, warming huts, ticket booths at snowmobile areas and other built facilities will be closed.Backcountry trails will remain open, but maintenance services, including grooming, have been suspended. Trail users are encouraged to use local facilities and not travel for recreation purposes. The facilities accessed by these groups will also remain closed.Learn More: For status updates on BC Parks closures, visit the BC Parks website: http://BCParks.caFor status updates on RSTBC campgrounds, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/sports-culture/recreation/camping-hiking/sites-trails\\nThe website will be updated in the coming days.

       "  '\\n\\nClose to 60 new supportive homes with around-the-clock supports are opening in Vancouver, as a result of a partnership between the Government of B.C., the City of Vancouver and the Government of Canada.“Everyone deserves a safe and secure place to call home,” said Selina Robinson, Minister for Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are taking urgent action with our partners because when people have housing, the entire community benefits.”Located at 3598 Copley St., Naomi Place consists of a three-storey building with 58 self-contained homes. Each of the units includes a private washroom and mini kitchen. The building also includes a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, and laundry and medical examination rooms.Community Builders, a non-profit organization that has been providing supportive housing in Vancouver since 2001, will operate the building. It will provide residents with support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness supports and opportunities for volunteer work. At least two staff members will be on site 24/7.“On behalf of the Community Builders staff and team, we are honoured to be part of this new temporary modular housing site in partnership with the City of Vancouver and BC Housing and assist in the delivery of 58 more housing spaces for those in Vancouver that need it most,” said Julie Roberts, executive director, Community Builders. “We know the opportunity to move into this building will be life changing for the 58 people who will soon call Naomi Place home. We look forward to being part of community-wide efforts to welcome our new residents and integrate this temporary modular housing site with its surrounding neighbourhood.”Naomi\\xa0Place will prioritize homes for people who are currently experiencing homelessness in the same neighbourhood as the development. BC Housing worked with its partners to identify people experiencing homelessness in the local area to move them into these homes. Residents started moving into these homes on March 23, 2020.The Province is also providing funding to keep Vancouver’s temporary shelters open. These 238 beds, operated across seven shelters, will remain open after April 1 to make sure people have access to a safe place to sleep, sanitation facilities and other supports.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nThe Province is providing $8.4 million to the project, as well as an annual operating subsidy of approximately $878,500.\\nThe City of Vancouver provided the land for the project.\\nIn just more than two years, the Province has built more than 2,100 supportive homes in communities around B.C., with more than 900 more underway and a goal of 4,900 over 10 years.\\nLearn More:New reports show that supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness is substantially improving the quality of life for residents and reducing their use of emergency health services.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Province has made two significant changes to the Employment Standards Act to better support workers both during the COVID-19 public health emergency and in the long term.Firstly, changes will allow workers to immediately take unpaid, job-protected leave if they are unable to work for reasons relating to COVID-19. This means workers who are ill, need to self-isolate, need to care for their child or other dependent, or whose employer is concerned that the employee may expose others to risk, will be able to take leave without putting their job at risk.“These proactive changes ensure that no one will lose their jobs for prioritizing their health and safety, or the health and safety of their loved ones and their community,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “Given these extraordinary times, we are ensuring that the legislation provides protections for those impacted by COVID-19.”The leave will be retroactive to Jan. 27, 2020, the date that the\\xa0first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in B.C. During this public health emergency, people can take this job-protected leave for as long as the circumstance that requires them to be away from work applies. \\xa0Secondly, to better support workers on an ongoing basis, the changes also provide up to three days of unpaid, job-protected leave each year for people who cannot work due to illness or injury. This is a permanent change to the act that brings B.C. in line with all other provinces in Canada.“This crisis has highlighted the importance of having permanent job-protected illness or injury leave in place for people in this province,” said Harry Bains, Minister of Labour. “We’re stepping up and bringing in this new leave to support workers over the long term, beyond this crisis.”While on job-protected leave related to the COVID-19 crisis, workers may also be eligible for financial support through\\xa0expanded Employment Insurance benefits through the federal government.Improving fairness for workers and ensuring balance in workplaces are shared priorities between government and the BC Green Party caucus and are part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:It is important that all employers and workers understand their rights, obligations and where to go for assistance — as well as keep\\xa0informed of both the provincial and federal supports for workers and businesses as they become available.For up-to-date, non-health information, including provincial and federal programs, call 1 888 COVID-19 or visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-supportFor more information on B.C.’s employment standards, visit:\\xa0https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standardsFor more information on federal Employment Insurance sickness benefits, visit:\\xa0https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.htmlFive things to know about job-protected leaves:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Job_Protected_Leave_Factsheet.pdfA backgrounder follows.Translations:Punjabi:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020-Mar23_Punjabi-NR_Three-DayLeave_COVID-19_ESA_Amendments.pdfTagalog:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-Three-Day-Leave-COVID-19-ESA-Amendments_Tagalog.pdfChinese:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-Three-Day-Leave-and-COVID-19-ESA-amendments_CN.pdfFarsi:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-Three-Day-Leave-COVID-19-ESA-Amendments_Farsi.pdfFrench:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-Three-Day-Leave-COVID-19-ESA-Amendments_FR.pdfKorean:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-Three-Day-Leave-COVID-19-ESA-Amendments_KN.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Les personnes et les entreprises ont besoin d’être soutenues de toute urgence, a déclaré le premier ministre John Horgan. Notre plan d’action est axé sur les services qui protègent la santé et la sécurité des personnes, il apporte une aide immédiate aux personnes et aux entreprises et il organise le rétablissement à long terme de l’économie de la Colombie-Britannique.\\u2009»Le plan d’action face à la COVID-19 est la première initiative du gouvernement pour venir en aide aux personnes et aux entreprises en Colombie-Britannique. Ce plan alloue 2,8\\xa0milliards\\xa0$ pour aider les personnes et financer les services dont elles ont besoin pour traverser la crise et 2,2\\xa0milliards\\xa0$ pour venir en aide aux entreprises et pour les aider à se rétablir après la flambée du virus.Le plan d’action de la Colombie-Britannique face à la COVID-19 s’appuie sur le plan économique fédéral et renforce les soutiens pour les Britanno-Colombiens afin que le paiement de leurs factures et leur maintien à flot ne soient pas source d’inquiétude.Soutenir les personnes et les services dont elles dépendentLe plan comprend des mesures immédiates pour aider les individus et les familles à faire face à d’éventuelles maladies, à des difficultés financières ou à des emplois précaires. Il augmente également le financement de services fondamentaux, comme les soins de santé, le logement et les services sociaux, pour s’assurer qu’ils continuent à soutenir les Britanno-Colombiens et qu’ils contribuent à enrayer la propagation de la COVID-19.«\\u2009Tant que cette crise durera, nous devrons assurer la sécurité des Britanno-Colombiens et la disponibilité des services vitaux, a affirmé la ministre des Finances Carole\\xa0James. Cela veut dire permettre aux gens de payer leurs factures, de rester chez eux en sécurité et de subvenir aux besoins de leurs familles en cette période exceptionnelle.\\u2009»Des 2,8\\xa0milliards\\xa0$ consacrés aux services et aux soutiens dont les Britanno-Colombiens auront besoin en ces temps difficiles, le gouvernement de la province affecte 1,1\\xa0milliard\\xa0$ au renforcement du revenu des personnes touchées par la COVID-19.Une nouvelle prestation d’urgence pour les travailleurs de la Colombie-Britannique, d’un montant de 1\\u2009000\\xa0dollars non imposable, sera versée aux Britanno-Colombiens que la flambée du virus empêche de travailler. Cette prestation sera un paiement exceptionnel pour les Britanno-Colombiens qui perçoivent l’assurance-emploi fédérale (AE) ou la nouvelle allocation de soins d’urgence fédérale ou la nouvelle allocation de soutien d’urgence fédérale à cause de la COVID-19. Les bénéficiaires seront notamment les travailleurs qui ont été mis à pied, qui sont malades ou placés en quarantaine, les parents d’enfants malades, les parents qui s’absentent du travail pendant la fermeture des garderies et des écoles et ceux qui prennent soin de membres de leur famille qui sont malades, comme un parent âgé. Ces travailleurs pourront être admissibles ou non à l’AE, comme les travailleurs autonomes. Cette prestation sera versée aux résidents de la Colombie-Britannique en plus des soutiens du revenu fédéraux.Le plan d’action face à la COVID-19 comprend d’autres mesures de renforcement des soutiens du revenu, dont l’augmentation et l’expansion du crédit pour la taxe sur les mesures climatiques de la Colombie-Britannique en juillet. Pas moins de 86\\xa0% des Britanno-Colombiens bénéficieront ainsi de fonds supplémentaires. Les familles admissibles de quatre personnes recevront jusqu’à 564\\xa0$ et les individus admissibles jusqu’à 218\\xa0$ grâce à cette augmentation du montant habituel du crédit pour la taxe sur les mesures climatiques qui pourra s’élever jusqu’à 112,50\\xa0$ par famille de quatre personnes et jusqu’à 43,50\\xa0$ par adulte.La prestation d’urgence pour les travailleurs et l’augmentation du crédit pour la taxe sur les mesures climatiques de la Colombie-Britannique compléteront l’une et l’autre les soutiens du revenu et aideront les personnes aux prises avec la perte de leur emploi, la baisse de leur revenu ou la hausse des coûts liée à la crise dans l’immédiat.La province veut avant tout assurer la sécurité et la santé des Britanno-Colombiens et les soutenir pendant toute la durée de la pandémie de la COVID-19. À cette fin, le plan d’action octroie 1,7\\xa0milliard\\xa0$ pour les services qui leur sont indispensables.Ces fonds de 1,7\\xa0milliard\\xa0$ financeront notamment des investissements dans l’aide au logement et les refuges, les programmes d’aide au revenu et aux personnes handicapées et les services de santé indispensables, comme l’assistance téléphonique du BC Centre for Disease Control. Ils financeront également les mesures de quarantaine, les tests de laboratoire et les travaux en cours à l’Autorité sanitaire des Premières Nations et au programme Better at Home de Centraide pour les aînés.Pour soutenir les organismes sans but lucratif, les organismes de prestation de services et les fournisseurs de services de garde d’enfants, la province maintiendra leur financement, même si ces organismes sont fermés ou si leurs activités habituelles sont perturbées. Les fournisseurs de services de garde d’enfants agréés qui resteront ouverts recevront un financement plus important afin de poursuivre leurs activités. Ces garderies sont admissibles à recevoir du gouvernement des fonds d’exploitation sept fois supérieurs à leur montant mensuel moyen, ce qui devrait couvrir approximativement 75\\xa0% de leurs dépenses d’exploitation mensuelles moyennes.Pour aider les personnes ayant contracté des prêts étudiants de la Colombie-Britannique, la province gèlera les paiements des prêts étudiants pendant six mois à partir du 30\\xa0mars\\xa02020. Les paiements des prêts étudiants fédéraux sont également gelés.Les Britanno-Colombiens qui ont besoin de plus de temps pour régler leurs factures peuvent également présenter une demande aux programmes d’étalement des paiements existants d’ICBC et de BC Hydro. ICBC reporte les paiements pendant une période pouvant aller jusqu’à 90\\xa0jours. Les personnes qui subissent la perte de leur emploi, une baisse de salaire ou qui sont malades à cause de la COVID-19 peuvent aussi être admissibles à recevoir jusqu’à 600\\xa0$ du programme de subventions du fonds de crise pour les clients de BC Hydro.Soutenir les entreprisesL’assise économique de la Colombie-Britannique est solide, mais les répercussions de la COVID‑19 se font sentir partout au pays et dans le monde entier. Cette pandémie touchera chaque aspect de l’économie de la province. Le plan d’action face à la COVID-19 aidera les entreprises à traverser la crise dans l’immédiat et préparera le terrain pour qu’elles puissent se remettre sur pied après la crise.Dès maintenant, les entreprises à la masse salariale supérieure à 500\\u2009000\\xa0$ pourront reporter les paiements de leur impôt santé jusqu’au 30 septembre\\xa02020. Les entreprises dont la masse salariale est inférieure à ce seuil sont déjà exemptées de cette taxe.En plus de l’impôt santé des employeurs, la province reporte au 30 septembre\\xa02020 la date limite pour les déclarations d’impôt et les paiements pour la taxe de vente provinciale, la taxe municipale et la taxe de district régional, la taxe sur le tabac, la taxe sur l’essence pour véhicules automobiles et la taxe sur les émissions carboniques. La hausse de la taxe sur les émissions carboniques prévue pour le 1er\\xa0avril, ainsi que les nouvelles exigences en matière d’inscription de taxe de vente provinciale pour le commerce électronique et la mise en œuvre de la taxe de vente provinciale pour les boissons gazeuses sucrées seront retardées et leur calendrier sera révisé d’ici le 30\\xa0septembre\\xa02020.L’impôt scolaire applicable aux catégories des biens commerciaux et des biens industriels standard et majeurs sera réduit de moitié. Cela offrira aux entreprises propriétaires de leurs locaux un allègement immédiat de 500\\xa0millions\\xa0$ qui permettra aux propriétaires de locaux commerciaux de faire bénéficier immédiatement de ces économies leurs locataires liés par des baux hypernets.À plus long terme, le plan de rétablissement consacrera du financement aux secteurs de l’économie durement touchés, comme le tourisme, l’accueil et la culture. Le gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique élabore un plan de stimulation économique, de concert avec les dirigeants d’entreprises et les dirigeants syndicaux. La province a alloué 1,5\\xa0milliard\\xa0$ au rétablissement économique.En savoir plusPour consulter le plan d’action de la Colombie-Britannique face à la COVID-19 et d’autres ressources et mises à jour gouvernementales, allez à\\xa0: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19Pour vous renseigner sur le Plan d’intervention économique du Canada pour répondre à la COVID-19, allez à\\xa0: https://www.canada.ca/fr/ministere-finances/plan-intervention-economique.htmlPour les renseignements non médicaux liés à la COVID-19, composez le 1\\xa0888\\xa0COVID-19.Pour obtenir de plus amples renseignements sur l’aide apportée aux personnes et aux entreprises par le plan d’action de la Colombie-Britannique face à la COVID-19, allez à\\xa0: http://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/bc-takes-steps-to-support-people-businesses-duringcovid-19-pandemic\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

That brings us to a total of 13 people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19. We extend our condolences to their loved ones.“Of the new cases, one patient is a health-care worker at the German-Canadian Care Home in Vancouver Coastal Health and one is a health-care worker at the Delta View Care Centre in Fraser Health.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 248 are in Vancouver Coastal Health, 150 are in Fraser Health, 39 are in Island Health, 30 are in Interior Health and five are in Northern Heath.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 33 individuals are currently hospitalized and 14 of them are in intensive care. We are pleased to report that 100 patients have recovered, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“The significant increase in confirmed recoveries is a result of many people who have been recovering in self isolation, with mild symptoms, meeting newly established criteria for recovery.“Our testing capacity has increased to about 3,000 tests per day, and that capacity will continue to increase this week.“The number of 811 calls we are able to answer has increased to more than 4,000 calls per day, as a result of adding 12 more nurses and 42 more navigators to our call centres.“Over the last week, several new physical distancing measures have been put in place around the province, in health regions and individual communities.“The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated, and everyone must do all they can to support our efforts break the chain of transmission and flatten the outbreak curve.“Our health-care workers are at the heart of our pandemic response and they face the added risks of exposure both in the community and at work.“Enhanced screening is in place for health-care workers, as well as clear guidance for appropriate use of personal protective equipment. As individuals, health-care workers must also have a heightened awareness of symptoms and maintain physical distance from others, as much as possible.“The Province of B.C. continues to put new tools in place to support British Columbians during this challenging time. In addition to the self-assessment tool on the BC Centre for Disease Control website, residents can now download a self-assessment app for their phones.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The self-assessment app can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-health questions about COVID-19 call 1-888-COVID-19 or visit:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\xa0To view tables of epidemic curve and age distribution, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Epidemic_Curve_Age_Distribution_March_20_2020.pdfFor the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities:\\xa0\\non Facebook:\\xa0https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\non Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNewsFor a Chinese translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.23_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

In order to ensure people’s health and safety, staff at Service BC centres are taking extra steps to regularly sanitize public and office spaces, and are modifying reception areas to support social distancing.During the first hour of business, vulnerable citizens\\xa0– including seniors and people who have\\xa0underlying health conditions or compromised immune systems – will now receive priority service by calling their local Service BC centre to make an appointment.Many government organizations are modifying their face-to-face supports due to the pandemic. Service BC is working closely with its partner agencies to identify the core programs and services that will continue to be available at Service BC centres. These include:\\nincome assistance and disability assistance;\\nresidential tenancy;\\nBC Services Card;\\ndrivers’ licensing;\\nAffordable Child Care Benefit;\\nMedical Services Plan (MSP); and\\nforest-worker support programs.\\nA full list of available services at each Service BC centre is available online, along with information on hours of operation at each site. In addition to physical offices around the province, Service BC supports citizens through online, telephone and text channels.People\\xa0are asked to call a Service BC centre, rather than coming in to an office, if:\\nthey are showing symptoms of COVID-19, including coughing, shortness of breath and fever;\\nthey have a sick family member or have been around someone who is sick; and/or\\nthey have not yet completed the 14-day isolation period after traveling abroad.\\nAdapting its approach will help Service BC support its employees, while also ensuring that citizens throughout B.C. – especially those most vulnerable – continue to have access to the core services they need most.Quick Facts:\\nCitizens can get help and access government services through Service BC’s Provincial Contact Centre from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific time), Monday to Friday (except statutory holidays):\\nPhone (toll-free) – 1 800 663-7867 (available in 110 languages)\\nSMS text – 604 660-6421 (English only)\\nTelephone device for the deaf – 711\\n\\nNew non-medical COVID-19 telephone and text lines help people connect to community supports, as well as programs and services from the provincial and federal governments.

       "  '\\n\\nDistillers in British Columbia are temporarily authorized to manufacture alcohol-based hand sanitizer to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, through an updated policy directive from the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB).“We are in unprecedented times and everyone must do their part to fight COVID-19,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Distilleries have been approaching us asking how they can help, and this new policy directive will mean they are authorized to manufacture alcohol-based hand sanitizer.”Previously, distilleries and other licensed manufacturing establishments would have required discretionary authorization from the general manager of LCRB in order to produce alternative products. However,\\xa0given the context of the current provincial health emergency related to COVID-19, the general manager is now permitting all distillers to produce alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizers must meet certain federal regulatory requirements. \\xa0Some distillers are donating the “excess alcohol” from their distilling process to a third party that can produce hand sanitizer. Others are producing the hand sanitizer themselves, taking steps to ensure products contain the necessary level of alcohol content to make them effective. Distillers will be able to donate or sell the hand sanitizer they have manufactured, and the authorization will be reviewed on an ongoing basis as the provincial health context changes.“The flexibility shown by distillers to create much-needed hand sanitizing products demonstrates the leadership of B.C.’s agriculture sector and highlights the additional and unforeseen roles that B.C.’s food and beverage producers can play in an emergency response,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “B.C.’s food and beverage sector has so much to offer, and these displays of businesses changing their operations to help British Columbians in our time of need emphasizes the value each of us add to our communities every time we Buy BC.”Public health officials would like to remind the public that the best way to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 is by thorough handwashing with soap and water, scrubbing for at least 20 seconds.Learn More:BC Centre for Disease Control’s guide to hand hygiene: http://www.bccdc.ca/Health-Professionals-Site/Documents/COVID19_Handwashing%20Poster_MD%20offices.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nDear friends,Thank you for doing your best in the fight against COVID-19!As a member of the cabinet of British Columbia, I can say with great sincerity that your provincial government is working incredibly hard to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. We are in this together and we will get through it together.As the minister of agriculture, I want to comment on two of the many urgent issues that my ministry is prioritizing on behalf of B.C.’s farm, fish and food sector.The first is seasonal labour. Seasonal labourers are a crucial and appreciated part of our food supply system. Every year more than 10,000 seasonal farm workers travel from their homes to work on farms and food-processing locations all over the province. They come from different regions, provinces and countries.It is the federal government that determines who can enter Canada and under what conditions. The Ministry of Agriculture’s executive team is working with the federal government and other provinces on a daily basis regarding foreign labour.I want to acknowledge the work done by the federal government as reflected in the announcement they made on March 20, 2020: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2020/03/canada-provides-update-on-exemptions-to-travel-restrictions-to-protect-canadians-and-support-the-economy.htmlTo safeguard health and food security, temporary foreign workers in the agriculture sector will be allowed under specific conditions to travel to Canada. I will be redoubling my efforts and working closely with key stakeholders and decision-makers – including foreign governments and the provincial health officer of B.C. – to help farmers\\xa0and processors\\xa0safely employ the foreign farmworkers they need. This is an urgent matter and with the proper precautions in place, it will benefit all British Columbians, as we all need access to safe, fresh, local food.We are also actively looking at new ways to encourage employment opportunities for British Columbians in the agriculture sector.Second, farmers markets. Under additional conditions regarding COVID-19, farmers markets can\\xa0continue to operate in B.C. at this time. The Ministry of Agriculture is working directly with the B.C. Association of Farmers’ Markets to assist with this season, and I'm pleased to share that the ministry will be providing financial support for it to develop an operating model better suited to times of a pandemic.Farmers in B.C. are a fundamental part of our food system, and farmers markets come in many shapes and sizes. Regrettably, at this time, the COVID-19 pandemic means they will not be about socializing and community. They will be focused on serving a very important purpose, though: helping people all over this province access fresh, locally grown or raised meat and other proteins, vegetables, fruit and many more foods and beverages. I want to thank everyone who works in the farm, fish and food sector – you are critical, and we appreciate you!I'm so proud of the agricultural sector that is working to adapt and keep on going. The harvest season comes early in many parts of B.C., so the work demands are already enormous. For farmers and others in the sector who need help, please see these messages I put out previously:\\nA summary of the agri-related federal economic measures that we have so far, coming from the announcement that was made by the government:\\xa0https://www.facebook.com/lana.popham/posts/10158371874553804\\nMinistry outreach to agriculture, food and fish stakeholders around the province:\\xa0https://www.facebook.com/lana.popham/posts/10158366953268804\\nThank you for helping us all get through this.Lana Popham\\nMinister of Agriculture\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAs the challenges caused by the COVID-19 outbreak continue to shift, the B.C. government and Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, are taking unprecedented measures to slow the transmission of COVID-19.Recently, Henry issued an order under the Public Health Act prohibiting the gathering of people in excess of 50 people at a place of which a person is the owner, occupier or operator, or for which they are otherwise responsible. Employers in the construction industry are asking for clarity about what this means for them.\\xa0While this order does not apply to construction sites as a whole, the public health officer is directing employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes:\\nThere should be no more than 50 people in the same space in any circumstances.\\nWhere possible, employees should maintain a distance of two metres apart from each other.\\nPost\\xa0signage that limits the number of occupants in any elevator to four people at a time.\\nReduce in-person meetings and other gatherings and hold site meetings in open spaces or outside.\\nIncrease the number of handwashing stations and post signage that identifies their location.\\nMaintain a list of employees that are currently working on sites and update this list daily.\\nAll common areas and surfaces should be cleaned at the end of each day. Examples include washrooms, shared offices, common tables, desks, light switches and door handles.\\nSelf-isolation can end 14 days after the last contact or return to Canada if you have not developed symptoms.\\nWith or without a history of travel, if you\\xa0have respiratory symptoms that can be managed at home,\\xa0self-isolate at home for at least 10 days after onset of symptoms.\\xa0After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you\\xa0feel better, you can return to your\\xa0routine activities.\\nCoughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.\\n\\nSection 4.85 of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation does provide for a minimum standard around the provision of washrooms and hand washing facilities. Where plumbed facilities are impracticable, employers must provide access to portable washroom and hand-washing facilities. Those facilities must be maintained in good working order and must be provided with the supplies necessary for their use.Employers should reassess their work environment every day and keep updated with the information posted on the Province’s website: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The B.C. government is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19, and the safety of British Columbians remains its top priority.Learn More:For more information on the COVID-19 response, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19For a Spanish translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_Guidance_to_construction_sites_operating_during_COVID_Spanish.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_Guidance_to_construction_sites_operating_during_COVID_(Punjabi).pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nIn order to reinforce social distancing orders and help support workers in the restaurant industry, government is making changes to temporarily allow restaurants to deliver liquor products alongside the purchase of a meal.“In these extraordinary times, more British Columbians are relying on delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Permitting licensed restaurants to hire their out of work servers to deliver liquor products as part of their food-delivery service allows the public to continue to observe social distancing measures and also offers much-needed support to these workers and businesses.”These changes will be made available to customers who purchase a meal and the sealed, packaged liquor product for pick up from the restaurant’s premises or for delivery at home. Previously, these licensees were only permitted to sell liquor for consumption in their establishment, unless they had a special endorsement on their licence. \\xa0Existing safeguards for safe consumption continue to be in place, such as verifying identification. The individuals delivering the liquor products will also be required to be certified with Serving It Right, which government hopes will help encourage businesses to use currently laid-off serving staff to make these deliveries. Staff in licensed establishments are already required to hold this certification.These changes come as the restaurant and hospitality industry have been deeply impacted by COVID-19. The Business Technical Advisory Panel, which consists of representatives of the liquor and hospitality industry, provided this recommendation to help support struggling hospitality workers and businesses during this time.“A special thank you to the members of the Business Technical Advisory Panel for their recommendations during this public health emergency that has had such a terrible impact on workers in our favourite bars and restaurants,” Eby added. “Government is committed to working with hospitality workers and businesses to identify ways to reduce the impact of this crisis.”The changes take effect immediately and expire July 15, 2020. The timeline can be amended by government through a regulation change.“These changes not only help restaurant operators through a very tough time, but also could support the many British Columbians working in our breweries, wineries and distilleries,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Supporting local businesses and choosing to Buy BC makes a real difference in our communities, especially at a time like this.”Learn More:Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch’s policy directive: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/employment-business-and-economic-development/business-management/liquor-regulation-licensing/policy-directives/20-05_sale_and_delivery_of_packaged_liquor_from_service_area_for_off-site_consumption.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

We offer our deepest condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.“Every health region in British Columbia has people with COVID-19: 230 are in Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, 126 are in Fraser Health Authority, 37 are in Vancouver Island Health Authority, 27 are in Interior Health Authority and four are in Northern Heath Authority.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases: 27 individuals are currently hospitalized, of which 12 are in intensive care, six individuals have recovered and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.“Until\\xa0further notice, personal service establishments – like barbershops, salons, nail estheticians, health spas, massage parlours, tattoo shops and others – are ordered to close.“As part of our COVID-19 response strategy, our B.C. team has been tracking the epidemiology of the virus. Epidemiology looks at the who, what, where and when of disease outbreaks – to better understand their sources and effectively combat them. That is how we were able to determine the initial cases in B.C. were travel-related.“Because we now know a lot more about COVID-19, our testing strategy has evolved to focus on clusters and outbreaks, patients in hospital and health-care workers.“Here in B.C., 55% of all positive cases are female. This is because we have seen younger, female health-care workers with the virus – mainly related to the Lynn Valley Care Centre and other long-term care outbreaks.“As part of the virus tracking, we look at two curves: the total number positive test results and the date of symptom onset, as determined by the public health investigation of each case.“We pay attention to the onset curve, because we know that the time from the onset of symptoms to when someone is tested can sometimes several days. This is because people’s initial symptoms may be too mild to consider speaking to their doctor or going for testing.“As we get more information about the onset of symptoms from patients, the onset curve is updated to reflect this new information.“To most effectively flatten the curve, and break the chain of transmission, we need everyone to take action at the onset stage. That is why we have put public gathering orders and social distancing measures in place now – to protect us in the weeks ahead.“Now is the time to stay home as much as possible, and to keep a safe distance from others when outside. We are reminding British Columbians that their actions today will determine the impact of the virus in coming weeks.”Learn More:To view tables of epidemic curve and age distribution, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Epidemic_Curve_Age_Distribution_March_20_2020.pdfFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/For non-health information on COVID-19 call 1 888 COVID-19 or visit www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAs British Columbians work to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the Province is taking swift action to protect vulnerable people, including those experiencing homelessness, in communities around British Columbia.Initial actions include:\\na ban on evictions for non-payment of rent in BC Housing-funded buildings;\\nthe development of distinct protocols and identification of sites to support isolation for vulnerable people experiencing homelessness – sheltered or unsheltered – and those in private single room occupancy (SROs) and social housing buildings;\\nsustaining service providers through continued payments to ensure they can pay their staff and operating costs; and\\ncentralized procurement for critical supplies needed by frontline providers, including gloves and cleaning products.\\n“Frontline workers are working tirelessly to ensure that vulnerable residents are protected across the province, recognizing the significant added risks that vulnerable people face in the context of the COVID-19 crisis,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are committed to making sure these frontline workers have the support they need to do their job – whether that’s in the form of safe spaces for people who need isolation or personal protective equipment for staff working in the field. We are all in this together.”Recognizing that vulnerable people in different circumstances face distinct risks, a provincial Vulnerable Population Working Group is working to identify, assess and address the immediate challenges faced in particular by five groups – people living on the street, people experiencing homelessness living in encampments, shelter residents, tenants of private SROs and tenants in social and supportive housing buildings.This working group includes representatives from the ministries of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Social Development and Poverty Reduction, Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, Mental Health and Addictions, Children and Family Development, Health, as well as Emergency Management BC, the City of Vancouver, the Office of the Provincial Health Officer, local health authorities, BC Housing and Community Living BC.Isolation protocols are being developed in partnership with local governments and health authorities based on the needs of vulnerable residents in each region. While in some situations self-isolation may be possible within a unit, additional locations have been identified throughout the province for those situations where off-site isolation of one or more people is required. In addition, recognizing that many providers have identified difficulty in sourcing necessary medical and cleaning supplies, BC Housing is now procuring personal protective equipment needed by frontline workers on a central basis and is distributing them directly to housing providers.“While all of us are feeling the effects of the COVID-19 crisis, there is no doubt that our most vulnerable populations including the homeless and the working poor are disproportionately affected,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “We are working together with our partners at every level of government and in the social services sector to find safe and efficient ways to provide supports to the people who need them the most as quickly as possible.”\\xa0Recognizing that many residents may face challenges in making rent payments as a result of COVID-19, BC Housing has implemented a moratorium on eviction for non-payment of rent in their directly managed properties and is also working with non-profit housing providers around the province to do the same. In addition, the process of applying for a rent reduction is being streamlined for tenants who have lost income as a result of COVID-19, including changing the rules to remove the requirement for proof that the decrease in income is permanent.People experiencing homelessness often have higher rates of health concerns, and as a result could be at greater risk if exposed to COVID-19. For that reason, enhanced screening and cleaning protocols are in place at residential facilities to reduce the potential that this virus can spread within the building and beyond. To support partners’ efforts, BC Housing is also working closely with the Ministry of Health, the provincial health officer, local health authorities, the BC Non-Profit Housing Association and the Aboriginal Housing Management Association to ensure non-profit providers can protect their guests and residents. This includes providing training and support in encouraging social distancing, best practices in building cleaning and maintenance, identification of on- and off-site isolation spaces, and access to testing and other services. \\xa0Learn More:For more information on BC Housing’s eviction and rent adjustment policy, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/publications/Covid-19-Bulletin-for-Housing-Providers-Eviction-and-Rent-Adjustment-Notification-March-18th-2020.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nPremier John Horgan and Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism, have issued the following statement marking the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination:“Today is International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a day to stand together against those who seek to divide us and renew our commitment to fight racism, prejudice and discrimination.“At a time when people around the world are using hate and division as tools, we must stay united. Through challenging times, we are always stronger and more resilient as a province when we treat each other with kindness, generosity and respect.“As individuals, we must use our voices to speak out against racism and discrimination. Those who have privilege must acknowledge it and learn to see the world from different perspectives. This is how we will truly understand ourselves and others.“As a government, we are working every day to build a better B.C., where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. We re-established the Human Rights Commission to protect and defend human rights throughout the province. In 2019, Ravi Kahlon, as\\xa0parliamentary secretary for sport and multiculturalism, held 21 community dialogues on racism and hate. As a result of these conversations, we launched Resilience BC, a new anti-racism network that will support partners in 40 communities throughout the province in their work to eliminate racism, discrimination and hate.“Today, and every day, we celebrate the multicultural province we are so lucky to live in. Our lives and communities are enriched by the diverse cultures that make up British Columbia.“Our government will continue to stand up for equality and justice, so our children will grow up in a province and a world where everyone feels valued and respected.”For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/20200321_STM_PJH_Day_for_Elimination_of_Racial_Discrimination_V5_FR.pdf\\nFor a Chinese translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.21_PJH_STM_In'tDisrcrimination_CN.pdf\\nFor a Punjabi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/20200321_STM_PJH_DayforEliminationofRacialDiscrimination_Punjabi.pdf\\nFor a Farsi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/20200321_STM_PJH_DayforEliminationofRacialDiscrimination_FARSI.pdf\\nFor a Hindi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/20200321_STM_PJH_DayforEliminationofRacialDiscrimination_Hindi.pdf\\nFor an Arabic translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/20200321_STM_PJH_DayforEliminationofRacialDiscrimination_ARABIC.pdf\\nFor a Vietnamese translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/20200321_STM_PJH_DayforEliminationofRacialDiscrimination_VIETNAMESE.pdf\\nFor a Tagalog translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/20200321_STM_PJH_DayforEliminationofRacialDiscrimination_TAGALOG.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nStaying connected to her culture has helped Tara Michelle Bridge work through her own intergenerational trauma and continues to help her support children and families in her community.Bridge, a child protection worker from the Kispiox First Nation, is one of the many front-line workers that Social Work Week recognizes and celebrates, March 15-21, 2020.Growing up, Bridge says she relied on spiritual and cultural practices like singing, drumming and sports to help her stay mentally, physically and emotionally healthy. After 11 years with the Ministry of Children and Family Development, Bridge still relies on her connection to culture to help her, her family and the children and families she works with to overcome difficult situations.“It’s important to understand that families dealing with intergenerational trauma often don’t realize that’s what it is,” Bridge said. “I bring in as many people as I can, the grandparents, aunts, uncles and the band representative, to start the conversation.”Bridge said she is always “up front and honest” with parents and makes it clear “there is work they need to do,” but that she is there to help and support them.One of the many reasons addressing intergenerational trauma is difficult, Bridge said, is because families often don’t want to talk about it. “They’re afraid their kids will be taken away,” which is why finding the right supports and cultural connections is important. Bridge works with parents and children to build a family plan, and then connects them with specific services through family wellness workers, counsellors and victim services so they can address the concerns.When working with Indigenous children, “finding even one connection to their culture can make a big difference,” Bridge said. “I worked with two children in care who were homeschooled, and when I asked if they knew where they were from, they didn’t.”Bridge worked with the parents and the band representative to develop a cultural plan, which included enrolling the kids in school where they could make new friends, socialize and connect to their community through various activities. It is a simple thing that Bridge said has made a huge difference.“They smile so much more, and you can tell they feel connected to their culture by being involved in their community. Children should always know where they come from and feel like they belong,” Bridge said, explaining that a connection to culture can help children feel supported, like they are part of something larger, and can help their confidence and personal development.Living and working as a child protection worker in a small community has its challenges. “I care about my community. My children are a part of it. It can be isolating though because people are wary of my work.”With her husband and three children, Bridge said finding healthy, cultural activities helps keep her grounded and focused. “I do a lot of crafting, I make jewelry\\xa0and I’m starting to bead. That connection to my culture helps me feel balanced.“I’m basically a child advocate. I believe in the possibility of healing.”Quick Facts:\\nAs of Dec. 31, 2019, there were a total of 3,408 employees providing front-line work on behalf of the Ministry of Children and Family Development.\\nAt Delegated Aboriginal Agencies, there are almost 400 front-line and administrative full-time equivalent employees.\\n\\nLearn More:If you think a child or youth (under 19 years of age) is being abused or neglected, call 1 800 663-9122 at any time, day or night.Visit the BC Association of Social Work: https://www.bcasw.org/For people interested in learning more about becoming front-line workers for the Ministry of Children and Family Development, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/job-seekers/featured-careers/social-work\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe British Columbia government is taking steps to support the child care sector while ensuring parents who must work during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to have access to child care, with new funding for providers.Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has advised all parents who can, should care for their children at home. She also recognized that while some centres may close, child care services can and must be provided in a safe manner for those families whose parents work in critical roles.The Province will give centres that remain open compensation to continue operating with reduced enrolment. Centres that close will also receive support for fixed operating costs, like rent or lease payments.“As a former early childhood educator (ECE), I understand how difficult this time is for those working in the child care sector,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “We are working hard with the Ministry of Health to address concerns. We have heard from many child care providers and ECEs who want to stay open to support families and essential service workers at this time. The measures we’re announcing today will give them the support they deserve and the tools they need to continue safely caring for children.”Child care providers staying open will receive enhanced funding to keep operations going. These centres are eligible to receive seven times their average monthly funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 75% of a group facility’s average monthly operating expenses. Child care centres remaining open will continue to receive ECE wage enhancements for their staff. These expanded financial supports will help facilities stay open, even with reduced enrolment, to support care needs for those parents who need it.Reducing the number of children in child care centres will make it easier for licensees and ECEs to follow preventative health measures. The Ministry of Health is developing detailed guidelines to inform licensees, ECEs and licensing officers on implementating best practice, which will be circulated to child care providers shortly.Child care providers who close due to COVID-19 will also receive support to help ensure they are able to pay their fixed costs, like rent/lease/mortgage during the temporary closure, so they can reopen when able. These centres are eligible to receive two times their average monthly funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 20% of an average group facility’s monthly operating expenses.Smaller home-based child care providers are also eligible for these supports.“I have received many messages from parents, providers and ECEs as this situation has evolved and this feedback has informed our way forward,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “These measures will provide some financial support to child care providers who need to close until they can return to providing services for families and ensures parents don’t face the economic burden of paying fees for services they aren’t using.”These\\xa0measures are in addition to increased federal government measures to support workers through Employment Insurance, the new Emergency Care and Support Benefits, and the Employment Insurance Work Sharing Program, as well as the wage subsidy support for small business. The Province will continue to work with federal partners to advocate for higher benefits for people affected by the pandemic as it prepares to announce further provincial supports for people and businesses.To support families who may be struggling with loss of employment and income, child care providers receiving these extraordinary payments must not charge parents fees for any periods of closure or for any vacant spaces while they are open, including when a parent chooses to temporarily withdraw a child due to COVID-19.They must also agree to reserve spaces for families that were accessing their services before the pandemic, even if these families choose to temporarily withdraw, so families can be assured their spot will still be there once the pandemic passes.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Fraser Health authority public health and infection control teams are on site.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 200 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 95 are in the Fraser Health region, 30 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 19 are in the Interior Health region and four are in the Northern Heath region.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, six people have completely recovered, 22 are receiving acute care, 10 are in intensive care and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.“As the number of cases increases and the pressure on our health-care system intensifies, we would like to acknowledge and thank our health-care workers as they support all those in B.C. who require testing and care for COVID-19.“In step with World Health Organization recommendations, the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Infection Prevention and Control provides clear guidance for all health-care workers to follow. They can be confident that by following these guidelines on appropriate use, we will have sufficient supply of personal protective equipment.“We need everybody to be aware of the risk in every community and every health region across B.C. And, equally important, because of the incubation period and rapid transmission, the self-isolation and social distancing that we do today will benefit all of us two weeks and two months from now.“Given the challenges social distancing presents for restaurants, effective immediately, all dine-in food services are prohibited. Restaurants must move to delivery or take-out options only, or close.“We also want to be clear that while spending time outdoors is important, people still need to stay away from groups in any environment – to prevent bringing the virus into their homes.“New resources are being made available every day to support everyone in our province as we continue to work to stop the transmission of COVID-19.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19 and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/For non-health information on COVID-19, call 1-888-COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest video of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nProvincial parks are a great place for people in B.C. to get out and enjoy nature, while following the social distancing directives from British Columbia’s provincial health officer (PHO).While BC Parks is bringing in some new novel coronavirus (COVID-19) protocols, people throughout B.C. will still be able to enjoy day-use parks as a positive way to connect to nature.Some day-use services and facilities are currently available at the following provincial parks:\\nMount Seymour Provincial Park – access restricted to some lower-elevation trails. Parking and road access are closed.\\nCypress Provincial Park – access restricted to some lower-elevation trails. Parking and road access are closed.\\nGoldstream Provincial Park\\nRathtrevor Beach Provincial Park\\nMiracle Beach Provincial Park\\nWells Gray Provincial Park\\n“Nature provides the perfect environment to promote health and well-being,\" said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We are following the advice of the provincial health officer to help people get outside, while ensuring they are following the PHO’s direction and guidance to stay healthy. Our government is taking every necessary step to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We look forward to a time when we can return to full operations at our provincial parks.”People will continue to be able to day hike and recreate in most all other provincial parks. However, there will be a temporary suspension of services and facility closures as a result of the ongoing provincial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Campgrounds and camping opportunities will be closed and existing reservations will be automatically refunded.The temporary measures include the suspension of services at marine parks, visitor centres, nature houses, washrooms and day-use facilities. Provincial park visitors may continue to use trails and areas where accessible. Visitors should be aware parking lots in some parks may be closed and gated where necessary.Provincial parks can attract large numbers, particularly those parks close to urban centres. Visitors should keep this in mind when choosing which park to visit. People are also reminded to keep at least two metres apart from each other during this time. In addition to social distancing, people may need to be extra patient and aware of their impact on the environment.\\xa0Full provincial park closures are also being implemented on a case-by-case basis, where required, to address concerns regarding health and safety. Visitors should be mindful that they are responsible for their own safety and that washroom facilities may not be available in most parks. They are asked to check the BC Parks website for any updates before heading out. Any changes to services at provincial parks will be posted to the BC Parks website: http://bcparks.caIn alignment with Parks Canada, all campgrounds, camping opportunities and accommodations will be closed until at least April 30, 2020. Refunds will be provided to those with existing reservations during this time.The Discover Camping reservation system has been suspended for all new reservations. No action is required for people with reservations to receive a refund. Refunds will be done automatically and are expected to take seven to 10 business days. A public notice will be issued once facilities are reopened and the system is able to accept new reservations.Many tourism operators and other businesses have permits to offer services and trips within BC Parks. This closure may affect the availability of services provided by commercial operators permitted to operate in BC Parks. Park visitors are advised to check with them directly before visiting to determine if there have been any changes to their services.BC Parks continues to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak closely and is following recommendations set out by the provincial health officer and minister of health to assess when to reopen facilities and services and return to full operations.Learn More:\\xa0For non-clinical information on COVID-19, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The latest information on COVID-19 protective measures is available through the BC Centre for Disease Control by calling 1 888-COVID19 or at: BCCDC.caBC Parks website: http://bcparks.ca\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nOver 100 piles of woody debris near Coglistiko Lake and Fishpot Lake will be burned between Monday, March 23 and March 31, 2020, to reduce wildfire risks and prepare for the upcoming tree-planting season.These controlled burns will be conducted by staff from the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. Burning will occur only on days when site and weather conditions are favourable and will allow smoke to dissipate.The areas around Coglistiko Lake and Fishpot Lake, about 10 kilometres west of Nazko and about 80 kilometres west of Quesnel, were heavily damaged by the 2017 Plateau wildfire and contained high concentrations of standing dead trees. The piles of wood were created when many of these dead trees were cut down.\\xa0\\xa0Burning the piles will allow more trees to be planted in the cleared areas this spring and also decrease future fire hazards in the area. Several of the piles will remain in place to enhance wildlife habitat by providing cover for martens, fishers and other animals.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nResidents along 0 Avenue (pronounced as\\xa0\"Zero Avenue\"), from Surrey to Aldergrove, are asked to report sightings of Asian giant hornets (Vespa mandarinia) that may emerge from their nests in the coming weeks and months.In December 2019, two specimens were found near Blaine,\\xa0Wash., and a single specimen was found in White Rock in November 2019. These findings indicate a probability that nesting hornets are overwintering in the area.Wooded habitat, like areas near the Canada-U.S. border, offer suitable hornet nesting grounds. Residents along 0 Avenue may be the first to notice them.The\\xa0provincial apiculturist will place hornet traps in the area and distribute pest-alert notices to 0 Avenue residents in the coming weeks, along with information and pictures of the Asian giant hornet and the steps to take if you spot the insect.Asian giant hornets are large compared to other hornets,\\xa0with noticeably large orange heads and black eyes. Worker hornets are approximately 3.5 cm in length. Queens can be up to\\xa04 cm\\xa0to 5 cm in length with a wingspan of 4 cm to\\xa07 cm.The Asian giant hornet is classified as a serious honeybee predator. Asian giant hornets hunt insects for food and generally are not interested in humans, pets and livestock. When their nest is disturbed, they will attack with painful stings, which can be hazardous to people’s health.British Columbians who think they may have seen\\xa0an Asian giant hornet\\xa0can report their findings to the Invasive Species Council of BC at 1 888 933-3722, via the council\\'s \"Report Invasives\" mobile phone app or online: https://bcinvasives.ca/reportThe Asian giant hornet was first found in British Columbia in August 2019 in Nanaimo.

We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.“Of the total cases, 152 are in Vancouver Coastal Health, 81 are in Fraser Health, 22 are in Island Health, 12 are in Interior Health and four are in Northern Heath.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 17 individuals are currently hospitalized, nine are in intensive care and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.“We know that social distancing is an important line of defence for all us – staying a fingertip-to-fingertip distance away from each other, but no touching. Equally important is maintaining our connections with friends, family and colleagues while many of us remain at home.“We are encouraged by the many innovative ways that people across B.C. are staying connected, while staying apart:“Virtual coffee dates on your phone or laptop, takeout windows at restaurants, spending time outside with our families, or even dropping off homemade baking or books for those self-isolating. British Columbians are taking the challenge to heart.“As individuals, there are many things we can do to stay connected. Getting outside in our many parks, walking your pet, or going for a bike ride are all safe.

Kamloops had a referendum scheduled for April 4, 2020.Decisions to reschedule the byelections and referendum will be made by local governments in conjunction with public health officials and Elections BC.

While they are temporary, it is extremely important that everyone in our province abide by these orders.“The provincial health officer can and will compel peace officers to enforce orders if that is required, but we believe it is far better to take precautions on a voluntary basis.“We continue to remind people of the three things they can do to help all of us: first, use hand hygiene, second, maintain social or physical distancing, and third, stay at home if you are sick or at high risk for serious illness.“Canada Blood Services has alerted us to an urgent need for new donations to maintain supply.

Nous travaillons de concert avec nos partenaires de tout le gouvernement et de l’industrie afin de coordonner les interventions d’urgence et n’hésiterons pas à recourir aux outils à notre disposition pour protéger la population.\\xa0»La déclaration de l’état d’urgence permet à la province, par l’entremise du ministre, de mettre en place toute mesure d’urgence provinciale qui s’impose concernant l’accès aux biens fonciers et aux ressources humaines pouvant s’avérer nécessaires pour prévenir les effets d’une situation d’urgence, intervenir ou atténuer de tels effets. Il pourrait s’agir de protéger les chaînes logistiques critiques afin de s’assurer que la population obtient des biens et services essentiels, et que l’infrastructure requise pour les interventions est facilement accessible.L’état d’urgence, une fois décrété, est d’abord en vigueur pendant 14\\xa0jours et pourrait être étendu ou abrégé, selon les besoins. Il s’applique à toute la province et permet de déployer des ressources fédérales, provinciales et régionales dans le cadre d’efforts coordonnés.En sa qualité de leader parlementaire, M.\\xa0Farnworth s’affaire également à reprendre les travaux de la Chambre afin de mener à bien les affaires urgentes du gouvernement et d’accélérer les interventions du gouvernement face à la COVID-19.«\\xa0Nous travaillons tous ensemble et mettons ces pouvoirs en place en vue de protéger notre population, notre système de santé et notre économie, indique Adrian\\xa0Dix, ministre de la Santé. Ces mesures provisoires nous seront d’un immense secours, à long terme. J’encourage les résidents de la Colombie-Britannique à respecter la situation actuelle et à garder à l’esprit que chacun de nous est lié par une responsabilité et un devoir civique d’entraide de son prochain, qu’il assumera en se conformant à toutes les ordonnances d’urgence.\\xa0»La province a instauré une ligne d’urgence, le 1\\xa0888\\xa0COVID-19, à l’intention des résidents de la Colombie-Britannique ayant besoin de renseignements non médicaux sur la COVID-19.

       "  '\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.\\'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:\"We are deeply saddened to announce that a further three people who tested positive for COVID-19 have recently passed away. Two were residents of the Lynn Valley Care Centre and one was a man in his 80s from the Fraser Health region. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.“We are also announcing 83 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 186 cases in British Columbia. Of the new cases, seven are currently hospitalized, four are in intensive care, five have recovered and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.“Of the total cases, 116 are in Vancouver Coastal, 47 are in Fraser, 12 are on Vancouver Island, seven are in Interior and four are in Northern health regions.“This steep increase in the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in B.C. is in large part a result of consolidating data this week\\xa0as our reporting process aligns with the increase in the number of tests that is now taking place in five sites around the province. We anticipate this will level off. \\xa0“The provincial health officer has declared a public health emergency. This is an additional step to ensure our province has more tools available to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\xa0“This declaration enables the provincial health officer to facilitate an even faster response to the rapidly changing situation and enact further measures to protect British Columbians, such as enforcement of orders limiting public gatherings of 50 people or more.“Effective immediately, businesses with liquor primary licences, such as bars, pubs and night clubs, must close as they are unable to adequately meet the requirements of social distancing. Restaurants and cafes that cannot maintain social distancing of one to two meters between patrons will need to move to take-out and delivery models.“We also remind British Columbians that public gatherings of more than 50 people – indoors or outdoors – must be cancelled.“This is the second time the provincial health officer has served notice under the Public Health Act to exercise emergency powers. The first declaration was in 2016, in response to the overdose crisis.“We would like to remind people that tests are available for all those who need them, but not everyone requires a test.“To further support people who are wondering if they should be tested, a new self-assessment tool is now available. Before calling 811, we recommend completing the self-assessment at: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/“We continue to remind people to please use hand hygiene, maintain social or physical distancing, and to stay at home if you are sick or at high risk for serious illness. That includes the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.“Sufficient physical distancing of one to two meters should be incorporated for workers and customers for businesses and services that will remain open to provide transportation, keep our communities safe and provide essential goods and services.“For those who have recently travelled outside of Canada and are currently self-isolating for 14 days: leaving your home, hotel or a similar place should only be done for essential errands, such as obtaining medication or food, and with a mask or tissues.“This is a time to support our friends, family and communities. Purchasing groceries for those isolating or donating blood to support our health-care system are some of the ways you can help. Canada Blood Services has added additional screening measures for increased vigilance to enable the continued supply of blood products for surgery, cancer treatments and emergencies.”Learn More:To view the provincial health officer\\'s order on people returning from travel, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topicsTo view the provincial health officer\\'s order on mass gatherings, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topicsFor more information on the updated testing strategy and self-isolation, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing-isolationFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, visit:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For the COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and planning materials, visit:\\xa0https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/pandemic-influenza.For more information and latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website:\\xa0http://www.bccdc.ca/To make an appointment to donate, download the GiveBlood app, call 1 888 2-DONATE (1 888 236-6283) or book online: https://blood.caFor the latest audio clips of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:\\xa0https://soundcloud.com/bcgov\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  'How parenthood made a difference for one child protection worker',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nRyan Hues, a ministry child protection worker, says becoming a parent has helped him to stay “real” in his role working with families and children under 12.Ryan is just one of many front-line workers who are being acknowledged for their work during Social Work Week, March 15-21, 2020.“Being a parent and a step-parent has helped me understand just how stressful kids can be,” he said. “Parenting isn’t easy. I recognize how overwhelmed parents can feel, and how it’s possible to end up in a position where they aren’t coping well.”When he follows up on a child protection complaint, he empathizes with the anxiety the process can create for parents who are already struggling. “We want them to recognize that we are there to support them and to see how we can collaborate with them. Our purpose is the safety of kids,” he said, adding, “It’s rare that we work with families and have to remove children. That is the absolute last resort.”Ryan’s best days are when “parents acknowledge that there is work to be done, they are willing to work collaboratively and they begin to help themselves to mitigate the impacts on their children. Seeing a parent do the work to better themselves is amazing to watch.”He believes the struggles he overcame in his teens and 20s have helped him to “get really honest” with the families he works with. “I don’t have blinders on. I’m quite aware of how families are impacted by issues like substance use, mental illness, unemployment and poverty, and even coping with the layers a blended family brings.”There are many threads for social workers to unravel. “Sometimes parents get caught up in being punitive toward their former partner and that adds a whole other layer of sorting out what’s actually going on,” Ryan said. “That’s why we always try to approach any child-protection complaint with curiosity. We ask, ‘Is this a new problem for this family? Do they have a history with the ministry? What worked for them the last time? And most importantly, how can we help them move forward?’ ”He says it was about nine years ago and a lot of soul-searching that led to a shift in his lifestyle from the unhealthy choices he’d made as a young teen and adult. “If I had to talk to my younger self now, I’d tell him what I’d tell youth in general: ‘You’re going to face a lot of struggles. It’s okay to be hurting. It’s okay to reach out and ask for help, and then actually allow someone to help you.\\xa0You don’t need to know everything all the time.’ ” One of the most important questions he asked himself when he was getting back on track was, “What kind of man do I really want to be?”Once Ryan had made up his mind to work in social services, he started volunteering at the Aboriginal Friendship Centre in Nanaimo. “I’d go there every day and spend time with youth at risk, many of whom were homeless.” He got a social services diploma and then went on to get a social work degree, continuing to work with youth. “I also learned a lot about colonization and systemic racism. I worked a lot with dads whose kids were in the care of the ministry. It really clued me in to my privilege,” he said.Now Ryan knows the answer to the question he asked himself all those years ago: “I want to be the kind of man who’s there for people when they need me to be – at work and in my personal life.”Quick Facts:\\nIf you think a child or youth (under 19 years of age) is being abused or neglected, call 1 800 663-9122 at any time of the day or night.\\nAs of Dec. 31, 2019, there were 3,408 employees providing front-line work on behalf of the ministry.

We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them during this difficult time.“We are also announcing 30 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 103 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal, Fraser, Interior and Island health regions and were confirmed positive, based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.“Six people confirmed positive are in acute care, five have fully recovered and all others are self-isolating at home.“A significant number of new cases are related to the Pacific Dental Conference 2020 held at the Vancouver Convention Centre on March 6 and 7, 2020. We are asking anyone who attended to self-isolate until March 22, 2020.“Today, we are taking a number of additional steps to address the changing situation in B.C. and ensure our health-care system is best positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.“British Columbia’s health authorities are directed to immediately move all hospitals in the province to Outbreak Response Phase 2. This means hospitals will undertake only urgent and emergency procedures and will postpone all non-urgent scheduled surgeries. Hospitals will review operating-room capacity daily to prioritize urgent and emergency cases.\\xa0“Lions Gate Hospital in the Vancouver Coastal Health region is directed to move to Outbreak Response Phase 3. This means the hospital will accept only emergency patients. Lions Gate Hospital is also preparing to open a dedicated COVID-19 unit to provide care to those with the virus.“These measures will assist hospitals to redeploy and train essential service\\xa0health-care providers on critical care related to COVID-19\\xa0to ensure sufficient medical supplies for patients and staff who need them\\xa0most, and to further increase capacity to respond to the potential for a surge of COVID-19 patients requiring acute care.“We have worked with the College of Pharmacists to advise pharmacies to provide patients with a prescription refill or an emergency supply of their medications\\xa0if needed. This will give physicians more time to care for patients with acute care needs. British Columbians are asked to respect this temporary arrangement and are reminded that there is no need to stockpile medication.“To further enhance the availability of physicians for all British Columbians, the Province will provide physicians compensation for providing virtual-care services. We have also requested all health regulators to begin emergency registration of non-practising or retired health-care professionals, including professionals from other jurisdictions and the armed forces.“Further, we are moving to restrict visitors in long-term care to essential visits only. Essential visits include compassionate visits for end-of-life care and\\xa0visits that support care plans for residents based on resident and family needs, for example, families who routinely visit to provide assistance with feeding or mobility.“In an effort to allow 811 health-care professionals to support more people who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or who require assistance with other health issues, the Province has created a dedicated phone service to provide British Columbians non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and social distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments.“British Columbians can reach service representatives seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., by calling 1 888 COVID19. Information is available in more than 110 languages.“We have also taken additional action to enhance social distancing and limit transmission. These efforts are not forever, but they are important for now.“We are issuing a new order prohibiting all public gatherings of more than 50 people. This includes indoor and outdoor sporting events, conferences, meetings, religious gatherings and other similar events.\\xa0“On the recommendation of the provincial health officer, the attorney general, minister responsible for the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, has ordered all casinos to close until further notice to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

Should you choose to travel, stay away from work or school for 14 days on your return. Guidance for self-isolation is available on the BCCDC website:\\xa0http://bccdc.ca“For those who must continue to cross our borders for essential travel, to facilitate the movement of goods and people, we recommend social distancing, active daily monitoring for symptoms and staying away from people who are most vulnerable while abroad and on your return.“In directing event organizers to cancel all gatherings larger than 250, our objective is to enable everyone to maintain important social distancing measures, which is much more challenging in larger events. It also means you can still do your shopping, go to restaurants, attend family events and continue to enjoy many other activities.“The recommendations and direction are about protecting our community and about slowing down the transmission of COVID-19 to enable our health-care system to continue to support those who need care – whether with COVID-19 or another illness.“We continue widespread testing of those with symptoms to identify cases of COVID-19 and take immediate action.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in Castlegar by investing in 30 new spaces. \\xa0“Partnering with local government lets us create more new licensed child care spaces that will help strengthen the community for years to come,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “This is about making a long-term investment in the area and the young families that call Castlegar home.”Through the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, the Regional District of Central Kootenay (RDCK) is creating 30 new spaces: 10 spaces for children aged three to five, and 20 school-age spaces. The RDCK is partnering with the Kootenay Family Place Society for Children and Youth, which has been operating child care centres in the area for over 45 years. The district expects the new centre to open in September 2021.“What an amazing time for the complex! Most new parents will tell you that available child care is a challenge in the Kootenays. I am one of those parents,” said Bergen Price, chair, Castlegar and District Recreation Commission. “As we continue to grow as a community, assets like these are essential. Thank you to the recreation commissioners, RDCK staff and Kootenay Family Place for making this happen.”The Circle of Indigenous Nations Society\\xa0will provide Indigenous programming for the centre. It also offers various supports like the Aboriginal Supported Child Development Program, which helps Indigenous families who have children with extra support needs to participate in the centre’s programming. Children at the centre will be involved in their community by helping out in the community garden, taking part in the Adopt a Street Litter Program\\xa0and through regular visits to the Castle View Seniors Centre.“We are excited to celebrate our innovative partnership with the Regional District of Central Kootenay and bringing much-needed access to child care to one of the most central, convenient and highly utilized facilities in the community,” said Jim Fisher, executive director, Kootenay Family Place. “This project will enhance early learning in our community and provide much-needed additional and flexible space for recreation programs and events in Castlegar.”In addition to child care, Kootenay Family Place will offer various wraparound services through partnerships with other affiliated programs. Kootenay Family Place also operates the local Neighbourhood House facility, which offers family support services, including weekly English-as-a-second language drop-in classes to support families new to the country. The new child care centre will also host early childhood education students from Selkirk College for the practicum portion of their program.This latest investment means that 53 new licensed child care spaces have been funded in Castlegar since July 2018. These new spaces are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history, with more than 13,000 funded since July 2018.An additional 4,100 spaces have been funded through the 2017 Budget Update\\xa0and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, bringing the total to more than 17,000 spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in Castlegar save more than $850,000 through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nSelkirk College Children’s Centre in Castlegar is one of more than 50 Childcare BC Universal Prototype Sites, providing 47 spaces for no more than $10 a day.\\nTo date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide more than 11,500 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, with another $1-per-hour lift to come in April 2020. This includes more than $30,000 for early childhood educators in Castlegar\\nLearn More:For more about Childcare BC, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcareTo learn more about the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund and to apply, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/newspacesfundTo find child care in your community, view the online child care map: http://maps.gov.bc.ca/ess/hm/ccf/Child care factsheet: https://news.gov.bc.ca/18430For more information on the Childcare BC Universal Prototype Sites, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcareprototypesitesFor more information on child care in Castlegar, visit: http://www.trailfair.ca/trail-castlegar-childcare-resource-referral-ccrr/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAfter five years as a child protection worker, Rachel Davidson says the biggest misconception people have about her work is that it is always negative.But that impression couldn’t be further from her reality.“Every single week, there’s a different success story. There’s always good news,” says Rachel, one of the many front-line workers that Social Work Week recognizes and celebrates March 15-21, 2020.“We are meeting with families on their worst days, but we also have the privilege of seeing them come out the other side,” Rachel explains. She often sees youth she has supported over the years at the grocery store or gym, and she is proud when she sees them thriving. It is also not unusual to have a youth come back to her office to say “hi” and keep in touch.When she’s working with a family, Rachel says she always uses what she refers to as the “least intrusive measure available” as a response, so children can remain with their parents. This includes developing a safety plan with parents to address concerns and helping them access resources, counselling or other services to support them in creating a safer and happier home.“I’m respectful but transparent with parents,” says Rachel, who highlights that being genuine goes a long way in building trust. “I tell them I know they are doing the best they can. Parents always have their children’s best interests at heart, and so do I.”Upon receiving a child protection report, Rachel meets with parents to discuss the concerns and generally starts with a simple question: “How have things been going lately?” She interviews the children to learn their perspective of life at home and uses their own words when talking with parents to help navigate the conversation, working with them to develop an agreed upon plan to move forward.The goal is always to preserve the family unit, but if a removal is necessary due to significant safety concerns, Rachel says the first alternative is finding extended family who can provide safe care. “I believe that identifying family members who love a child and have a pre-existing relationship with them can only support positive outcomes. At times there can be complex dynamics between parents and extended family members, and it’s always important to remind parents the purpose of involving them is to support family connections for their child, while also allowing parents the time to address the concerns we have for them.”Recently, the ministry created a new position, a family finder, which is a networking role that specifically searches for extended family members who might be a good fit to step in and care for a child. In 2019, 4,522 children and youth were placed in out-of-care options, including in the care of extended family members instead of in the care of the ministry.Rachel says she’s grateful for the supportive home she grew up in\\xa0and the stories her mother, who worked with at-risk youth, and grandmother, also a child protection worker, shared with her. She says these relationships and experiences played a role in her finding this career path.Considering the demands of her job, Rachel says her close-knit team and getting her “sweat on at the gym every day before work” are the key to a healthy work/life balance. “My team is always sharing success stories with each other. There’s a lot more positivity in our role than most people realize. I love being here and it may sound cliché, but I could not imagine working anywhere else.”Quick Facts:\\nAs of Dec. 31, 2019, there were a total of 3,408 employees providing front-line work on behalf of the Ministry of Children and Family Development.\\nAt Delegated Aboriginal Agencies, there are almost 400 front-line and administrative full-time equivalent employees.\\n\\nLearn More:If you think a child or youth (under 19 years of age) is being abused or neglected, call 1 800 663-9122 at any time of the day or night.Visit the BC Association of Social Work: https://www.bcasw.org/If you are interested in learning more about becoming a front-line worker for the Ministry of Children and Family Development, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/job-seekers/featured-careers/social-work\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

PPMB recipients have faced a range of adverse experiences, including homelessness or domestic violence, and often have chronic health conditions, such as mental illness or addiction, that make finding and sustaining employment challenging.“Provincial supports, such as income assistance and employment programs, are meant to help some of the most vulnerable people in B.C.,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Projects like this will ensure that our programs are actually reaching the people who need them most, when they need them most, and create sustainable employment by meeting people where they are in their lives.”The project will create a set of wraparound services for people on PPMB assistance, based on person-centred outcomes that acknowledge the individual experiences and promote personal choice and recovery. The project will assess the success of each of the services, with a focus on physical and mental-health outcomes and how successful people are in finding and maintaining volunteering, training and employment. The CMHA BC will provide quarterly reports to the Province and release a final report that will help develop future B.C. government programs and services.\\xa0“A sense of purpose and the chance to contribute can make a huge difference to someone on their pathway to healing and hope,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “This project is creating new ways for people with multiple barriers, including mental-health and substance-use challenges, to fully participate in their communities and find new ways forward.”“This unique project will combine proven employment supports, trauma-informed and culturally safe practices, and primary care to pave a path forward toward hope for people living with significant mental-health and substance-use problems,” said Jonny Morris, chief executive officer, CMHA BC. “Meaningful, paid work is a key driver of recovery, and we are excited to work with people with lived experience to design and offer the right services at the right time to help workers with mental illness become valued members of the workforce.”Quick Facts:\\nWorkBC’s CEP program aims to increase employment opportunities for unemployed British Columbians through partnerships, research and innovative job-creation projects.\\nOver $19 million will be invested in CEP projects around B.C. in 2019-20.\\nLearn More:Learn how CEPs are helping local communities:\\nwww.workbc.ca/Employment-Services/Community-and-Employer-Partnerships.aspxFind out more about the Canadian Mental Health Association: https://cmha.ca/\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions and were confirmed positive, based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.“Three cases are connected to the Hollyburn House Retirement Residence, three cases are travel-related and one is a community case.“The three individuals are connected to the Hollyburn House Retirement Residence in West Vancouver include case 48, a male in his 40s and case 49, a female in her 40s, both of whom are health-care workers at Hollyburn. Case 47 is a man in his 90s, a resident. Public health teams are on site and actively working to investigate and contain potential transmission to other residents and workers. The outbreak at this facility is linked to the outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre.“Case 50 is a man in his 40s who returned from travel in the United Kingdom and lives in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.“Case 51 is a man in his 40s. Case 52 is a woman in her 40s. Both cases 51 and 52 live in the Vancouver Coastal Health\\xa0region and are returning from a group trip to Egypt.“Case 53 is a man in his 50s and is a community case identified through laboratory surveillance. He is self-isolating at his home in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.Of B.C.’s 53 COVID-19 cases, four people have fully recovered and one woman in her 60s remains in in hospital in the Fraser Health region in stable condition. All other individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 are in isolation at home with care and support from public health teams.“With the increasing transmission of COVID-19 at mass gatherings and events, in addition to the escalating risk of community transmission, we must do our best to slow transmission of COVID-19 and protect our communities.“Our schools and our workplaces are operating safely, and we want to keep it that way.“We are recommending against all non-essential travel outside of Canada, including to the United States. Effective today, anyone who chooses to travel outside of Canada will be asked to stay away from work or school for 14 days upon their return. We know that this is a voluntary measure, but it is our expectation that people will follow this direction as part of their civic duty.\\xa0“Effective today, we also directing all event organizers to cancel any gathering larger than 250 people. This includes indoor and outdoor sporting events, conferences, meetings, religious gatherings or other similar events. This threshold has been selected, as it is much easier to maintain important social distancing to prevent transmission of COVID-19.“Some post-secondary institutions have classes with more than 250 students, and we are working with them to take measures to address this situation.“Over spring break the B.C. government will also work with school districts to develop procedures to be implemented with students and staff when classes resume.“We are asking employers to excuse staff for sick leave without requiring a doctor’s note, if their employees are ill or required to self-isolate. We are also reinforcing that if you have symptoms and may have been exposed to COVID-19, you must call your local primary care provider, or 811, to arrange for safe testing.“We have heard reports of employers requiring all their staff to get tested. Only a health-care professional can determine whether you require a test – and employers should not require employees to have a test if a health-care provider has recommended against it.“We recognize this will have a significant economic and social impact, and want to reassure British Columbians that these are temporary measures required to protect the health of the public at this critical time of pandemic. We will be reassessing these conditions on an ongoing basis as the pandemic evolves.“Our 811 navigators and nurses are doing an incredible job with record high call volumes - providing support to 3,291 callers yesterday, March 11, 2020.

The Surrey School District is contributing an additional $5 million for the Darts Hill site.“Our student population has been steadily increasing every year, with rapid growth in South Surrey,” explains Laurie Larsen, chair of the Surrey Board of Education. “An addition at Sunnyside Elementary and a new school site in the Darts Hill area will help our district respond to this growth and move students out of portables and back into schools.”This new funding is needed to help address the number of portables in the district, where only one new school has opened since 2014.\\n\\nSince September 2017, the Province has approved over $301 million for school capital projects in Surrey, which is helping over 7,600 new student seats open in the district between 2018 and 2022, eliminating the equivalent of nearly 305 portables.There are many more new projects to come in Surrey, with four school sites now purchased and eight expansion projects supported for business case development. \\xa0The Sunnyside Elementary expansion is scheduled to be complete in September 2022.There are currently 12 portables in use at the school. This expansion, along with a new addition at Pacific Heights opening in April 2020 and a new Edgewood Drive Elementary school opening in September 2021, will eliminate the need for 11 of those portables.To continue improving schools for students in Surrey and throughout B.C., Budget 2020 includes a record $2.8 billion for school capital projects, including new and expanded schools, seismic upgrades and land purchases for future schools.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Through these difficult circumstances, I have learned much about myself, people, life and matured, so I look forward to this second chance at having my own home, to care for and to learn to stand on my own and be who I can be.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nThe Province provided $15.5 million to the project through the Rapid Response to Homelessness program and will provide up to $1 million in annual operational funding.\\nB.C.-based manufacturer Horizon North was selected by the Province to manufacture these new homes in Kelowna, and for several other modular projects in B.C., supporting jobs and local economies.\\nWith the opening of Samuel Place, Hearthstone (46 homes) and Heath House (40 homes), there are now 136 supportive homes in Kelowna that have opened within the past two years and an additional 100 homes are underway.\\nIn just over two years, government has built more than 2,100 supportive homes, with over 900 more underway and a goal of 4,900 over 10 years.\\nLearn More:New reports show that supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness is substantially improving the quality of life for residents and reducing their use of emergency health services.

It will guide government investments and identifies three key priority areas: increasing sport participation, strengthening athlete development and enhancing event hosting opportunities for B.C. communities.“We know sport contributes to our health and wellness and adds to the vibrancy of our communities,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism Arts and Culture. “Every person should have an opportunity to enjoy the benefits of active living, and this is why we are putting forward a plan for a provincial sport system that is accessible, affordable, safe and inclusive for everyone.”The framework is based on four key principles: affordability, accessibility, equity and inclusion, and safety and ethics. It focuses on those who continue to be under-represented in sport, including people with disabilities, lower income families, Indigenous peoples, immigrants and new Canadians, 55+ adults, and girls, women and non-binary genders.\\xa0This framework will also guide new relationships with Indigenous peoples based on reconciliation and respect as B.C. continues to lead Canada in implementing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's\\xa0Calls to Action related to sport.“ViaSport is proud of its role in supporting the process of creating B.C.’s strategic framework for sport, helping to ensure that sport continues to be a catalyst for positive health, social and community benefits,” said Charlene Krepiakevich, CEO of viaSport.Quick Facts:\\nCurrently, more than 800,000 British Columbians play organized sports and are members of one of the more than 70 provincial sports organizations, multi-sport organizations\\xa0or disability sport organizations.\\nB.C. is a leader in Canada for high-performance sport, contributing approximately 34% of the athletes on Canadian national teams.\\nIn February 2019, B.C. endorsed the Red Deer Declaration, which called for a co-ordinated response to addressing and preventing harassment, abuse and discrimination in sport.\\nAs part of the 2020 Athlete of the Year Awards, the Province launched the new Delivering on Diversity Award, which recognizes a provincial, disability or multi-sport organization that has demonstrated a commitment toward advancing accessibility and inclusion in sport.\\nThe award supports the Province’s commitment to gender-based analysis plus, diversity and inclusion.\\n\\nLearn More:The Pathways to Sport framework: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/sports-culture/sportsRead more about viaSport’s work: https://www.viasport.ca/\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAmendments to the Agricultural Land Commission Act are now in force, improving the ability of the Agricultural Land Commission (ALC) to preserve farmland, encourage farming and protect local food supplies throughout British Columbia.Bill 15 received royal assent last spring, and new regulations were developed in consultation with representatives of local governments and a technical working group that included the Union of B.C. Municipalities, the ALC and the BC Agriculture Council.The changes strengthen the ALC by giving the commission more flexibility to create decision-making panels that can better consider local and regional circumstances for land within the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR). This amendment allows the ALC to reduce decision wait times for landowners and make better use of the commissioners, drawing on their expertise in a related technical field or land-use issue.In addition, the process by which farmland can be permanently removed from the ALR will now go through a planning approach so that only local governments, First Nations and other prescribed bodies can make exclusion applications directly to the ALC. This change strengthens the exclusion application process by empowering local governments to ensure ALC decisions align with the land-use plans in their own communities. Private landowners can still request that their land be removed from the ALR provided their local government agrees and makes the application to the ALC.During the recent Strengthening Farming public consultation, local governments indicated they need sufficient transition time to implement these changes. As a result of this feedback, this change will go into effect on Sept. 30, 2020.Other changes include:\\nsimplifying the ALC application fee process so ALR landowners only pay the local or First Nations governments their portions of an application fee, and if these governments later forward the application to ALC, pay the ALC directly for its portion of the fee;\\nadding new decision-making criteria to prioritize the protection of the size, integrity and continuity of the land base that the ALC must consider when exercising any power or performing a duty under the act;\\nbringing more rigour to the reconsideration process by clarifying the circumstances under which reconsiderations will proceed; and\\nensuring the ALC chair can give input to government regarding commissioner appointments.\\nQuick Facts:\\nThe ALR includes 46,159 square kilometres of B.C. that are preserved for agricultural use, which is equivalent to less than 5% of B.C.’s total land base.\\nPrior to the establishment of the ALR in 1973, thousands of hectares of farmland were lost to development every year.\\nLearn More:ALC directive on implementing changes: https://www.alc.gov.bc.ca/assets/alc/assets/about-the-alc/operations-and-governance/chair_directive_establishment_of_panels_for_the_purposes_of_determining_applications.pdfAgricultural Land Commission: https://www.alc.gov.bc.ca/alc/content/home\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

One person is in hospital. All other patients with COVID-19 remain in isolation at home with care and support from public health teams.“We have seen an increase in community cases in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley in recent days, where the source of the virus infection is not yet known. Public health teams are actively investigating, as we continue work to limit the spread of transmission in B.C.“Today, we are asking British Columbians to take additional care of seniors and people with compromised immune systems. Do not visit them if you are sick. If they are living at home and are sick, consider how you may support them with food and other necessities. If you need to visit a long-term care home or other health-care facility, go one person at a time and limit your visit to the person you know.“We are working with all long-term care and assisted living facilities to implement enhanced prevention measures to further protect all residents.“If any British Columbian has been notified by event organizers that they may have been exposed to COVID-19, such as the recent Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada conference in Toronto, we are strongly recommending social distancing in the workplace and at home, especially from those most vulnerable, in addition to closely monitoring for symptoms.“Today, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. As part of the British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Co-ordination Plan, we continue to focus on containment to break the chains of transmission, and we are using all the tools in our toolbox required at this time.“As an example, callers to British Columbia’s HealthLink 811 line have experienced intermittent busy signals today as call volume has increased. We are resolving this by adding more staff, more phone lines and a new menu option to provide a dedicated queue for calls about COVID-19.“The British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Co-ordination Plan details the preparations and comprehensive toolkit to respond to the evolving outbreak.

The Columbia Basin Trust is also providing a $115,300 grant for the new building. The society also received contributions from the City of Trail, Teck Resources Ltd., and Kootenay Savings Community Foundation.“The City of Trail is very pleased to see provincial investment in Trail,” said Lisa Pasin, mayor, City of Trail. “New homes for families and seniors are a need in our community, and we appreciate receiving funding for this worthy initiative.”The building will provide one-, two- and three-bedroom homes for households with incomes below approximately $41,500. It will be located overlooking the Columbia River, within easy walking distance of a full range of commercial, health and recreation services and amenities.“Columbia Park will provide affordable rental housing for the households in greatest housing need in the region and within the City of Trail,” said Jan Morton, president, Lower Columbia Affordable Housing Society. “These are one- and two-person households (many of whom are seniors) and families, which account for 40% of households in housing need in the region, more than half of whom live in Trail. The Lower Columbia Affordable Housing Society wishes to thank its funders and partners: BC Housing, Columbia Basin Trust, Teck Resources Ltd. (Trail Operations), Kootenay Savings Community Foundation and DJM Contracting Ltd.”The new homes are expected to be open by February 2021.“Thanks to these nine units, more seniors and families in need will have a safe and affordable place to call home,” said Johnny Strilaeff, president and CEO, Columbia Basin Trust. “We thank the society and Province for continuing to partner with us to address this important issue.”This project is part of more than 23,000 new homes that are completed or underway throughout B.C. because of provincial investments.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Government of B.C. is partnering with the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre Society (VAFCS) and the City of Vancouver on a proposal to provide more than 160 new affordable homes and 80 shelter spaces for people and families in downtown Vancouver.“It’s great to see the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre, the City of Vancouver and the Government of B.C. working together to address the desperate need for housing,” said Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant, on behalf of Selina Robinson, Minister of\\xa0Municipal Affairs and Housing. “1015 East Hastings will provide various housing options that meet the needs of my diverse constituents. Partnerships like this will go a long way to deliver the safe, secure and affordable housing people deserve.”The proposed site for the mixed-use development is the vacant lot at 1015 East Hastings St. The city currently owns the site. It is an ideal location for the development due to its proximity to transit and services.In the coming weeks, BC Housing and VAFCS will submit an application to rezone the site. The proposal will include:\\n85 affordable rental homes\\n53\\xa0rental homes at or below market rent\\n25 supportive homes\\n80 shelter beds\\ncommercial space to be operated by VAFCS\\n“This project is designed to make a positive contribution to the community,” said Susan Tatoosh, executive director, VAFCS. “It will help people gain the skills they need to transition to independent living, celebrate the area’s rich and vibrant Indigenous history, and create a space where neighbours can connect to each other and people from all cultural backgrounds.”Once rezoned, BC Housing would take over ownership of the site. The VAFCS would operate the shelter and supportive housing, which would prioritize spaces for Indigenous peoples experiencing homelessness in the community. BC Housing is in the process of working with the Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) to identify a non-profit partner to operate the affordable rental homes.“AHMA’s vision aligns with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Article 23, which\\xa0states, ‘Indigenous Peoples have the right to be actively involved in developing and determining health, housing and other economic social programmes affecting them,’” said Margaret Pfoh, CEO, AHMA. “The Province partnering with our members of the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre Society is an integral step towards obtaining that vision. We know this partnership will lead to incredible positive impacts and we look forward to welcoming future residents to the AHMA community.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nOn March 31, 2020, all partners will host an information session for neighbours and the broader community to learn more about the proposal. Details about the information session can be found on BC Housing’s Let’s Talk page: www.letstalkhousingbc.ca/1015EHastings\\nThrough investments by the Province, more than 23,000 new homes are complete, under construction or in development for people with a range of incomes throughout B.C., including more than 3,500 homes in Vancouver.\\nLearn More:To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nPost-secondary education and training will be more affordable for thousands of students throughout B.C., thanks to the new B.C. Access Grant program.“The new B.C. Access Grant will break down financial barriers and enable thousands more students to get a college or university education in their chosen fields,” said Premier John Horgan. “It’s part of our government’s work to build a strong economy for everyone, where people can get good, well-paying jobs that support them and their families, and business can access more skilled workers.”Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation spoke with students from the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology (NVIT) and celebrated the new grant, which will take effect in September 2020. Eligible students can receive up to $4,000 per year through the new program.The new, needs-based B.C. Access Grant will target those who need it most: low- and middle-income students. Students will receive the grant at the beginning of their studies, so they can pay for tuition, text books, lab and other supplies needed for their program of study.For the first time, such funding will also be available for students who are studying in programs under two years, including certificate and diploma programs, as well as for students studying part time. The changes nearly double the number of students who will be eligible to receive support.“Students have been calling for this moment for almost two decades,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “The new grant will open doors to post-secondary education for thousands of British Columbians who were shut out for far too long. This is a game changer that will benefit students who need it the most, especially with their up-front costs like tuition and books. I am so proud that our government is investing in the next generation of students.”The B.C. Access Grant complements the Canada Student Grant for Full-time Students, ensuring B.C. students attending public post-secondary institutions receive up to $4,000 a year to help with the cost of programs leading to a certificate, diploma or degree.“The youth of today are our future. I have spoken with students on many occasions about both the challenges and opportunities of pursuing post-secondary education, and I believe these grants will make a difference in their path ahead. By making these new grants available – the first new investment in post-secondary grants by the provincial government in 15 years – we are supporting students who might otherwise struggle to pursue their studies and helping to build a better, stronger B.C. for tomorrow,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation.Government is investing $24 million in new funding over three years. This is in addition to approximately $37 million government is reinvesting from existing grant programs that don’t help students with the up-front costs of their post-secondary education.\\xa0More than 40,000 low- and middle-income students will be eligible for the new B.C. Access Grant, which will be available starting in the fall 2020 semester.\\xa0Quick Facts:\\nStudents will automatically be assessed for their eligibility for the B.C. Access Grant when they apply for financial assistance from StudentAid BC.\\nEligible students in programs that are under two years in length will receive up to $4,000 per year.\\nEligible students in programs that are two years or longer will receive up to $1,000 per year.\\nThese students may also be eligible for the Canada Student Grant for Full-time students of up to $3,000 per year.\\n\\nLearn More:For more information about the B.C.

       "  '\\n\\nNorth and Central Island residents living with kidney disease now have access to integrated, specialized care closer to home, thanks to a new kidney care clinic at the North Island Hospital in Campbell River.The clinic, funded by BC Renal and operated by Island Health, officially opened on Jan. 6, 2020, to support people living with kidney disease but who do not require dialysis or post-transplant care.“March is National Kidney Month, so it is particularly appropriate that we recognize the excellent work being done here in Campbell River to support improved kidney health,” said Claire Trevena, MLA for North Island. “This is an excellent resource for the people of the North Island living with kidney disease.”In the past, North Island residents had to travel to Nanaimo to see a kidney specialist or wait for travelling care teams to visit Campbell River or the Comox Valley. Now they have access to a new kidney care team that includes nurses, a dietitian, social worker and pharmacy technician.“It’s excellent to see care provided in a way that works best for the patient, as we work on developing a health system that truly meets the needs of patients, where they are in the community, at home,” said Adrian Dix, Minister\\xa0of Health. “By reducing the burden of travel for patients on the North Island, we’re helping them be empowered with their health to address the challenges of living with kidney disease.”The clinic, located in the hospital’s wellness centre, operates from Monday to Friday. Kidney specialists, called nephrologists, will visit weekly.The Campbell River kidney care clinic, which is the third such clinic in Island Health, provides patients with expert education, counselling and support with things like diet, medication and other important factors that influence overall health and disease progression. Approximately 250 patients benefited when their care was moved to the new clinic. Future patients will be referred by their nephrologist.Visiting clinics, with travelling practitioners from Nanaimo, will continue to be held in the Comox Valley.Quotes:Dr. Adeera Levin, executive director, BC Renal –\"Research clearly shows that early identification and treatment can slow or even stop progression of kidney disease through changes to lifestyle and diet, as well as medications. The more involved a person is in his or her own care, the better the results.”Teresa Backx, manager of Renal Services, Island Health –“The goals of the clinic are to provide information and support for people with advanced or quickly progressing kidney disease. The clinic promotes patients being involved in their care and has an emphasis on self-management. Patient visits don’t always need to include a nephrologist, but they can work with the rest of our care team to slow progression of their illness or prepare them for treatment options if required. This clinic will deliver care closer to home, which is really important. Once they begin receiving care, patients want to visit the clinics. Making it easier for patients in this region to access a kidney care clinic is a real benefit to them and their families.”Walter Podovsky, Comox Valley patient – “The people in Nanaimo are wonderful, but it’s that much farther to travel. It will be great to have the clinic in Campbell River. I’m sure it will be well used.”Learn More:For more information about kidney care within Island Health, visit: www.islandhealth.caFor information about Kidney Health Month and BC Renal, visit: www.bcrenalagency.ca\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

To me, this demonstrates reconciliation in action,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Providing students with up-to-date, industry-standard trades training is vital to building a 21st-century workforce throughout the province. We need more people from all walks of life to fuel their passion and take advantage of the training and employment opportunities in the trades, including culinary arts.”The Province has invested $300,000 through the Aboriginal Community-Based Training Partnerships Program to fund the Stó:lō Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training (SASET) Culinary Arts program – a 12-week pre-trades training program at VCC and UFV that provides first aid, Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System, FoodSafe and SuperHost certificates, along with pre-apprenticeship training, including a work practicum placement.“A career in the culinary arts is a lifelong endeavour where learning never stops and job satisfaction happens every day,” said Chris Monkman, culinary instructor,\\xa0UFV. “We’re thankful the Province recognizes the need for partnerships like this, as well as the need for state-of-the-art training equipment and spaces. This partnership really is a win-win.”An additional $200,000 in capital funding from the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training is also being invested at UFV to build a new test kitchen space and provide equipment for the program. The project is underway at the Chilliwack campus where Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, made the announcement on behalf of Mark.“I’m proud to be a part of a government that’s taking action to ensure students have access to affordable education and skills training,” said Beare. “This partnership between UFV, VCC and the Stó:lō Nation is giving these students the hands-on training and experience they need to pursue a good career in the trades.”Skills training that is culturally sensitive and relevant for Indigenous peoples helps meet the Calls to Action set out by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The SASET Culinary Arts program has been delivered to more than 140 students and has had positive impacts. At the course’s end, more than three-quarters of its students were employed\\xa0or enrolled in further education.Quote:Jimmy McKay, SASET student, UFV –“This course and our instructor really opened up my eyes to the culinary world, and I feel like myself when I cook and bake.

The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions and were confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.“Two cases are connected to the Lynn Valley Care Centre, three cases are travel-related and two cases are under active investigation.“Case 33 is a woman in her 40s and case 34 is a woman in her 50s, both of whom work at the Lynn Valley Care Centre. There are no new resident cases.“Case 35 is a woman in her late 60s who recently returned from a tour in Egypt.

       "  '\\n\\nA good public transit system is essential to building strong communities that are more affordable for the people who live in them.The B.C. government is committed to making life more affordable for British Columbians, improving the services that people count on and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Public transit is a service that contributes to these goals.Public transit services in over 130 communities are provided by BC Transit, funded by a cost-sharing partnership between provincial and local governments (Victoria Regional Transit Commission in Greater Victoria).The B.C. government will continue to support public infrastructure projects to increase safety for people, create connected communities and help BC Transit meet people’s public transit needs for generations to come.Key facts on transit investments:\\nThe B.C. government continues to work with BC Transit, the federal government and local governments to fund transit improvements throughout B.C., including improving handyDART service.\\nThe B.C. government’s budget for public transit outside Metro Vancouver is over $190 million in 2020. This includes $115.8 million in operating grants to make transit affordable for local governments, and capital investments of $77.4 million.\\xa0\\nOver the next three years, the Province’s capital investments, including the purchase of new buses, are projected to be $251.3 million. These investments allow BC Transit to fully leverage funding from partnerships with the Government of Canada and local governments.\\nThrough the Government of Canada’s Public Transit Infrastructure Fund (PTIF) and Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP), the Province of B.C., the Government of Canada and local governments are partnering to fund $1.2 billion in transit investments over the next decade in communities served by BC Transit.\\nThis partnership will pay for new and replacement buses, such as electric and compressed natural gas, smart technologies including NextRide, safety technology (CCTV cameras), advanced fare technology, new and upgraded transit facilities, and new transit exchanges, park and rides, and bus lanes.\\nTransit services in northern B.C. have also been enhanced in support of the Province’s efforts to enable safe, affordable travel for Indigenous communities, residents and organizations through BC Bus North and the B.C. government’s Highway 16 Transportation Action Plan.\\nThese combined investments will allow B.C. to support a growing population with a public transit system that is environmentally sound, affordable, accessible and convenient.\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nIn\\xa0the wake of the unprecedented 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons, the B.C. government has invested heavily in wildfire prevention and preparedness initiatives to help keep British Columbians safe and protect the province’s natural resources and infrastructure.The B.C. government has increased Direct Fire funding in Budget 2020 by $35 million, for a total of $136 million per year. This increase recognizes historical firefighting costs and allows for increased response capacity, community engagement and communication resources, to help communities be better prepared for wildfires.Government strongly supports the efforts of local governments and First Nations to reduce wildfire risks in and around their communities by completing fuel management projects, developing Community Wildfire\\xa0Resiliency Plans and implementing FireSmart principles. This work is particularly important in the wildland-urban interface, where urban development borders on grasslands and forested areas.The Community Resiliency Investment program, launched in September 2018, provides $60 million to assist local governments and First Nations mitigate wildfire threats around their communities. As of March 9, 2020, 209 Community Resiliency Investment program grants have been allocated provincewide, amounting to more than $18.6 million.The BC Wildfire Service works closely with land managers to undertake a variety of fuel management activities to reduce wildfire risks, including the use of prescribed fire. A more comprehensive prescribed burning program, which will incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and is supported by an initial $10 million provided in Budget 2019, is being developed.Volunteer and composite fire departments throughout B.C. will receive a $5-million boost for equipment and training through the Province’s Community Emergency Preparedness Fund, distributed through the Union of B.C. Municipalities. This money is part of a newly established funding stream to help eligible applicants in local government and First Nations communities build resiliency with firefighter training and new or replacement firefighting equipment.Community Resiliency Investment program:\\nThe B.C. government has committed $60 million to the Community Resiliency Investment program to help local governments and First Nations mitigate wildfire threats around their communities. The program, launched in September 2018, replaces the Strategic Wildfire Prevention Initiative.\\nAs of March 9, 2020, 209 Community Resiliency Investment program grants have been allocated provincewide, amounting to more than $18.6 million.\\nThe program allows local governments and First Nations to apply for funding to cover up to 100% of their wildfire risk reduction projects. Eligible applicants with a lower wildfire risk can apply for up to $25,000 per year, but applicants with a demonstrated higher wildfire risk can now apply for up to $150,000 per year.\\nThe Community Resiliency Investment program takes a proactive approach to wildfire risk reduction and fuel management treatments by considering fire prevention and FireSmart activities on provincial Crown land, private land, local government land and reserve land.\\nPartnerships between local governments, First Nations and other tenure holders are encouraged, particularly in areas where treatments, vegetation management or other activities cross administrative boundaries.\\nMore information about the Community Resiliency Investment program and the application process is available on the Union of B.C. Municipalities website: www.ubcm.ca/cri\\nMore crews and equipment:The BC Wildfire Service (BCWS) has made changes\\xa0to its operations to enhance its response capabilities.\\nMore than 1,700 firefighters and support staff were available\\xa0for the 2019 wildfire season. Both the Northwest Fire Centre and Prince George Fire Centre added additional initial attack crews in remote locations.\\nThe use of the industry equipment strike team model is being expanded throughout the province to support initial attack efforts. These strike teams are a combination of heavy equipment, operators and line locator personnel that can be quickly deployed in response situations.\\nBCWS\\xa0held\\xa0joint training workshops with forest industry licensees in spring 2019 to enhance wildfire response throughout the province.\\nThe Province\\'s long-term contracted fleet for the 2019 fire season consisted of 32 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, about 80 ground-attack vehicles and additional short-term contractors. Other national and international resources may be requested through mutual aid agreements.\\nThe integration of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft was improved to maximize efficiency and firefighting aircraft contracts were longer for the 2019 fire season. For example, the availability period for the \"Fire Boss\" skimmer aircraft group (consisting of four Air Tractor “Fire Boss” airtankers and one Cessna Grand Caravan bird dog) was increased from 100 to 120 days.\\nBCWS and the Office of the Fire Commissioner are working on an expanded structure protection program, which will provide additional resources in rural and wildland-urban interface areas.\\nType 1 firefighting crews are BCWS’s most highly trained frontline firefighters and have experience using a variety of firefighting equipment. BCWS also regularly calls on the services of contract crews to support wildfire management in British Columbia.\\nType 2 contract crews are used to supplement BCWS firefighters and for sustained action support. Type 2 crews carry out expanded attack operations, including hand-guard construction, mop-up, and patrol duties.\\nOnce part or all of a fire is considered to be under control, Type 3 contract crews may be brought in to mop up the fire using pumps and hoses, patrol burned areas using hand tools to extinguish any remaining hotspots, or remove equipment once a fire is fully extinguished.\\nStrengthening partnerships:\\nOne of the key themes of the Abbott-Chapman report on the 2017 wildfire and freshet seasons (Addressing the New Normal: 21st Century Disaster Management in British Columbia) was the need to re-examine how the provincial government works with First Nations on wildfire issues.\\nSignificant progress has been made to keep First Nations better informed on fire-related topics, such as:\\npre-season forecasts;\\nfire season debriefings;\\nthe use of heavy equipment; and\\nfirefighting equipment caches in remote communities.\\n\\nBCWS will continue to meet regularly with Indigenous communities to discuss communications, firefighter recruitment opportunities and contract opportunities.\\nBCWS has partnered with the First Nations’ Emergency Services Society of B.C. and Indigenous Services Canada on a strategy to deliver training required for Type 3 and Type 2 firefighting crews. The First Nations’ Emergency Services Society of B.C.\\xa0is leading this training, supported by $150,000 from the BC Wildfire Service and $75,000 from Indigenous Services Canada.\\nBased on a pilot project conducted in Alexis Creek, BCWS is developing a First Nations firefighter recruitment strategy to be implemented throughout B.C.\\nGuidance is being provided to interested Indigenous communities to respond to master standing offer requests to supply Type 3 firefighting crews. BCWS is also providing advice to Indigenous communities interested in upgrading their existing Type 3 crews to Type 2 crews.\\nAs part of ongoing efforts to help keep communities safe from wildfires, the B.C. government has provided $500,000 to the B.C. Cattlemen’s Association to work on an initiative to use grazing livestock to help manage fine fuels in parts of B.C. Targeted grazing is not a solution to all fuel management challenges, but it is a powerful tool when combined with other methods, such as prescribed burning and selective tree harvesting.\\nIn partnership with the Fraser Basin Council, BCWS is holding community wildfire roundtables in communities facing a high wildfire risk. This $300,000 program is being delivered over\\xa0two years.\\nBCWS is providing $400,000 to the Association of B.C. Forest Professionals to develop fire-related professional development sessions, which will provide guidance on the use of fire and management of fire risk when planning forestry operations.\\nIn partnership with the Western Forestry Contractors’ Association, BCWS has formed a contract advisory committee to co-operatively develop procurement processes and allow BCWS to work more effectively with the contracting community.\\nFireSmart program\\nMitigating wildfire risk is a shared responsibility. British Columbians can play a crucial role in mitigating wildfire risks around their homes and properties by using FireSmart principles.\\nFireSmart is founded on seven disciplines that are part of the responsibility or mandate of different organizations and/or levels of government:\\neducation;\\nvegetation management;\\nlegislation and planning;\\ndevelopment considerations;\\ninter-agency co-operation;\\nemergency planning; and\\ncross-training.\\n\\nFireSmart is the Canadian standard recognized by all provinces and territories, based on National Fire Protection Association standards that have evolved over the last 40 years. FireSmart is backed by a vast amount of field, laboratory and modelling research. Its methods were demonstrated time and time again to reduce the risk of losses, under even the most extreme fire conditions.\\nGiven the effects of climate change and the increased number of homes being developed in forested areas, B.C. residents need to undertake FireSmart activities to help protect their homes and neighbourhoods from wildfires.\\nThe FireSmart Begins at Home manual was developed to help people reduce the risk of personal property damage due to wildfires. The manual and more information about the FireSmart program are available online: www.firesmartbc.ca\\nThe BC FireSmart Committee was established in May 2017 to deliver a more effective FireSmart program throughout the province. The committee includes representation from:\\nBC Wildfire Service\\nOffice of the Fire Commissioner\\nUnion of B.C. Municipalities\\nFire Chiefs’ Association of British Columbia\\nEmergency Management BC\\nForest Enhancement Society of B.C.\\xa0\\nFirst Nations’ Emergency Services Society of B.C.\\n\\nForest Enhancement Society of British Columbia:\\nThe Forest Enhancement Society of B.C., a Crown agency, was established in 2016 to advance environmental and resource stewardship of the province’s forests by:\\npreventing and mitigating the impact of wildfires;\\nimproving damaged or low-value forests;\\nimproving habitat for wildlife;\\nsupporting the use of fibre from damaged and low-value forests; and\\ntreating forests to improve the management of greenhouse gases.\\n\\nTo date, the B.C. government has invested $235 million in the society, with about $233 million allocated, as of Jan. 30, 2020,\\xa0for wildfire risk reduction, reforestation, forest rehabilitation, wildlife habitat restoration and raising awareness of the FireSmart program.\\nEducation and enforcement\\nPublic outreach was significantly expanded in recent years to make full use of online resources and social media tools, such as Facebook and Twitter.\\nNearly half of all wildfires each year are caused by human activity, so the BC Wildfire Service puts a strong emphasis on wildfire prevention, public education and enforcement.\\nIn April 2016, the B.C. government significantly increased ticket fines for 19 different violations under the Wildfire Act and another seven violations under the Wildfire Regulation. British Columbia now has some of the highest wildfire-related violation ticket fines in Canada. More information about these changes is available online: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/about-bcws/governance/legislation-regulations/summary-of-fines?keyword=fine\\nAnyone found in contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a ticket for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Currently under construction, the centre will accommodate 42 children, ages three to five.\\xa0“I’m proud to see our government investing in the young families that are the future of our community,” said Doug Donaldson, MLA for Stikine. \"These new child care spaces will make it easier for parents to pursue career opportunities here in the North, while helping to set children up for success.”The school district will be working with Coast Mountain College to support early childhood educator training to help create new opportunities for recruitment and retention. The new school, along with the child care centre, is expected to be open for the 2021-22 school year.“School District 54 looks forward to this opportunity to develop an active partnership with child care providers for enhancing both the transitions from preschool to kindergarten, as well as before- and after-school care options for school-aged children,” said Michael McDiarmid, superintendent of School District 54. “The district anticipates that this investment will create enriched learning environments for both preschool and school-aged children.”This investment means that 95 new licensed child care spaces have been funded in Smithers since July 2018. This is part of the fastest provincewide creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history, with support for more than 13,000.An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, takes the total to more than 17,000 spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in the Smithers area save more than $965,000 through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Recent changes made by the Ministry of Education to the School Act will make it even easier for school boards to create and operate before- and after-school care. The changes will also require school boards to create an inclusive child care policy and prioritize space that is not being used for K-12 students for child care.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nTo date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide more than 11,500 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, with another $1-per-hour lift to come in April 2020.\\n\\xa0This includes more than $34,000 for early childhood educators in Smithers.\\nLearn More:For more about Childcare BC, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcareTo learn more about the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund and to apply, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/newspacesfundTo find child care in your community, view the online child care map: http://maps.gov.bc.ca/ess/hm/ccf/Child care factsheet: https://news.gov.bc.ca/18430For more information on child care in Smithers and the\\xa0surrounding area, visit: www.bvcdc.ca/programs/ccrr/child-care-resource-and-referral-ccr\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Other steps include launching a public inquiry into money laundering in B.C.’s economy and introducing legislation to end ownership hidden in corporations and real estate.Public consultations are underway to gain input on the creation of a registry of beneficial ownership information for B.C.’s private businesses, modernizing mortgage-broker legislation and regulating money services businesses.Quick Facts:\\nThe Securities Act regulates the buying and selling of securities, such as stocks, bonds and other financial instruments, and the raising of funds by companies in the capital market\\nIn October 2019, the B.C. government passed new legislation to equip the BCSC with the strongest enforcement and collection tools in the country.\\nMost of the amendments to the Securities Act will come into force on March 27, 2020, with the remaining changes to follow in the coming months.\\xa0\\nLearn More:B.C.

It’s time to pull back the curtain on fuel pricing.”Effective immediately, the BCUC has been named as the administrator of the FPTA. The FPTA will require companies to submit regular information to the BCUC about the fuel market in British Columbia. It also gives the BCUC power to make special requests for information outside of the regular reporting schedule. Information that could be collected includes refined fuel imports and exports, and\\xa0fuel volumes at refineries and terminals, as well as wholesale and retail prices.The FPTA was developed in response to the BCUC investigation that found a lack of competition and substantial markups in the province’s gasoline market, including a 10- to 13-cent-per-litre premium being charged to drivers that industry was unable to explain during the BCUC inquiry. This unexplained premium results in British Columbians paying an extra $490 million every year.The FPTA will make companies publicly accountable for unexplained markups and price increases, and produce a common set of facts to help government properly evaluate other policy measures to bring fairness at the pump.Government will now engage with the BCUC on further steps in the implementation of the FPTA, with work underway to determine the type and frequency of the information to be collected on a regular reporting schedule through regulation.Learn More:Learn more about the FPTA: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019JTT0048-002219\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

We offer our heartfelt condolences to his loved ones, and the staff who provided him care, during this difficult time.“We are also announcing five new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 32 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions and were confirmed positive, based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.“Two of the new cases (case 28, 29) are close contacts of case 21, who is a health-care worker at the Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver.\\xa0Case 28 is a man in his teens and case 29 is a man in his 50s. Case 30 is a woman in her 40s and is also a health-care worker at the Lynn Valley Care Centre.

Case 32 is a man in his 30s who recently returned from travel to Italy. They both live in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.“As part of our COVID-19 response, public health teams undertake source tracing and notification of close contacts, in addition to risk assessments to determine appropriate action to protect British Columbians.“Three COVID-19 patients are receiving care in hospital. All other individuals are stable and in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.\\xa0So far,\\xa0four of B.C.’s 32 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 have fully recovered.“Cruise ships continue to be high-risk environments for transmission. Today the federal government has recommended that Canadians avoid all cruise ship travel due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.\\xa0“There has been a notable transmission of COVID-19 at group events – large and small. As a result, we recommend social distancing, forgoing usual greetings, consideration for virtual gatherings and, most importantly, staying away if you are experiencing any illness.“Event organizers should ask all participants to stay away if they are sick, returning from affected areas or have underlying health conditions that may be impacted by respiratory illness. Organizers should also complete a risk assessment considering what is happening in the local community and who may attend the event. Guidance is available from the World Health Organization and the BC Centre for Disease Control, and local public health teams can assist with this assessment.“The British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Coordination Plan details the preparations and comprehensive toolkit to respond to the evolving outbreak.

The B.C. government is committed to continually improving western trade corridors and supporting commercial truck drivers, as well as making investments in infrastructure that will help importers and exporters get goods to market, quickly and efficiently.In addition, as part of the government’s CleanBC plan, the ministry is committed to reducing carbon pollution created by the transportation sector as a necessary step towards creating a cleaner, better future. Recently, the B.C. government and the BC Trucking Association unveiled a new heavy-duty vehicle efficiency program that will help lower greenhouse gas emissions and will help commercial truck drivers spend less money on fuel.A snapshot of B.C.’s trade sector:\\nIn 2019, B.C.'s transportation network allowed for $144.32 billion in exports and imports to be transported through B.C.:\\xa0\\n$71.5 billion worth of goods by ship;\\xa0\\xa0\\n$41.75 billion worth of goods by road;\\xa0\\n$11.92 billion by rail;\\n$8.41 billion by air; and\\n$10.74 billion by other modes.\\n\\nGovernment continues to work closely with other provinces, the Government of Canada, the Port of Vancouver and Prince Rupert, CN, CP and other industry partners to take advantage of B.C.’s strategic location at the crossroads of the North American marketplace and the economies of Asia.\\nGovernment and industry leaders are working together to analyze the future needs of the labour force\\xa0and ensure all current and future workers have the skills to take advantage of the growing opportunities in the transportation sector.\\nIn response to increasing container traffic at B.C. ports, the B.C. government has partnered\\xa0with Canada, the ports, local governments and the private sector on projects that support economic activity. For example:\\nGovernment continues to move forward with a $260-million roadway upgrade in Delta. Through a partnership with Government of B.C., Government of Canada, Vancouver Fraser Port Authority and Tsawwassen First Nations, the Highway 91/17 and Deltaport Way Upgrade Project is a combination of improvements to boost safety and efficiency along the Highway 91 Connector and Deltaport Way.\\nThe B.C. government is partnering on a major project with the Government of Canada and the Township of Langley to invest a further $235.5 million to widen Highway 1 another 10 kilometers between 216th and 264th streets. The project will add a new HOV lane in each direction, reconfiguring the 232nd Street interchange and adding a new underpass at Glover Road and the CP Rail crossing.\\nKeeping people and goods moving: \\nThe Port of Vancouver volume was 144 million tonnes of cargo in 2019 - a 2% decrease from 2018.

It includes an additional $12.2 million from CleanBC that will give school districts more resources through the Carbon Neutral Capital Program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide operating cost savings from energy efficiencies. This can include adding solar panels, high efficiency boilers and LED lighting upgrades to schools, as well as installing electric vehicle charging stations. \\xa0CleanBC is government’s plan to reduce carbon pollution and build a cleaner economy for people throughout B.C., through approximately $1.3 billion in provincial funding over four years.\\xa0“All youth deserve a brighter future and that’s what CleanBC is about,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We’re working with school districts throughout the province to create healthier learning environments for students and modelling a more secure future through energy efficient buildings and transportation options.”To further support green energy initiatives, school districts will now have the option to purchase electric school buses through the Bus Acquisition Program. This new initiative helps school districts switch to zero-emission, clean-energy vehicles.“B.C. is leading the country in transitioning to electric vehicles, and our government is supporting that movement wherever we can,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “Helping school districts invest in electric buses contributes not only to a cleaner environment, but also a healthier space for students.”The 2020-21 Bus Acquisition Program provides $13 million for 31 school districts to buy\\xa0101 new buses, including up to 15 electric buses. Districts that buy electric buses will also have access to provincial funding for charging station infrastructure.Along with the new CleanBC funding, the Carbon Neutral Capital Program is providing $17.2 million to school districts for 67 energy efficient projects this year, such as a new solar-power system at Edgehill Elementary in Powell River that will help reduce emissions and provide future cost savings.The School Enhancement Program supports school districts to upgrade roofing, fire systems, washrooms (including conversion to gender-neutral washrooms), windows and more. This year’s funding is $64 million, which includes gender-neutral washroom upgrades at 10 schools in the Coast Mountain School District.Through the Building Envelope Program, districts are receiving a combined $8 million to remediate schools that have suffered water damage.In addition to these programs, the $115.5-million Annual Facility Grant will allow all school districts to undertake additional maintenance projects that promote the continued safe and efficient operation of schools. Many of the projects will benefit school districts by saving money on electricity, natural gas, fuel and ongoing maintenance. Those savings can be reinvested in classrooms to support student learning.Education funding is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quote:Paul Faoro, president, CUPE BC – “On behalf of the more than 30,000 CUPE members who work to make our public schools safe, welcoming and inclusive for all students, I welcome this record level of investment from the provincial government, and we applaud the decision that savings that flow from improved energy efficiency can be directed to classrooms to support student learning.”For a\\xa0backgrounder\\xa0detailing approved investments in each school district, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/School_Funding_Programs_2020-21.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nEven more B.C. parents will have access to child care as the Province marks the latest milestone in its popular Childcare BC plan with funding for more than 13,000 new spaces since July 2018.“Our government has embarked on the biggest child care space creation program in B.C.’s history,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “In just over 18 months, we have, on average, funded almost 700 new spaces per month because families have been waiting too long for access to licensed child care. We’ve been overwhelmed by the positive response from providers, large and small, wanting to work with us to support families as part of our Childcare BC plan.”Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care, announced the new spaces at the celebration for\\xa0the latest achievement in Burnaby.\\xa0The majority of Burnaby’s 682 newly approved spaces are the result of a partnership between the Burnaby School District and the City of Burnaby.“These new spaces are being created through the collective strengths of our partners,” said Chen. “The City of Burnaby and the Burnaby School District have been among the first to step up and work with the Province to deliver hundreds of spaces at a time. It’s this kind of critical mass we want to see more of for all communities, and recent proposed changes to the School Act are designed to make\\xa0it easier for school boards to operate before- and after-school spaces.”Changes to the School Act will also allow school boards to prioritize available space and create programs based on the unique needs of their community, as well as require them to create an inclusive child care policy.“Safe, affordable, licensed care gives parents and guardians the peace of mind they need to go to work or school – knowing they have quality care they can rely on close to home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Our government is paving the way to ensure more child care is offered on school grounds, giving Burnaby families more supports and services.”The Burnaby School District is partnering with the Province and the City of Burnaby to create 601 new spaces at eight different locations on school district property, with six located on elementary school properties. Operators will provide inclusive environments for children, including serving those with extra-support needs, as well as vulnerable populations, Indigenous communities and families who are new to Canada.“There is no better investment a government can make than investing in our children,” said Stace Dayment, a Burnaby parent. “This is a historic and positive change. I am excited for the families of our community to finally have this essential service.”In addition, Doxa Education Group is creating 81 new spaces in Burnaby.The new spaces are part of the fastest provincewide creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history. An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update\\xa0and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, bring\\xa0the total to more than 17,000 spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents save up to $1,600 a month per child, for a total of more than $400 million going to families through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative. Through these programs, almost 29,000 children have received child care for no more than $10 a day.“Expanding access to public child care and early childhood education spaces has been foundational to this minority government,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “Aligning early childhood care and learning with our existing schools, in particular, has been a wonderful way to further invest in our public education system and create healthier communities.”Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.QuotesMike Hurley, mayor, City of Burnaby – \\xa0“High-quality, affordable child care helps families choose to live and work in Burnaby. That helps our business community maintain and attract the workforce they need to keep our economy strong.”Gary Wong, chair, Burnaby Board of Education –“The spaces we’re announcing today represent a significant increase at a district level. Burnaby families need everyone in the community to pull together to help, and that’s what’s happening through partnerships with the provincial government, the City of Burnaby and our school district. We’ve been a leader for more than 35 years in enabling space in our schools and on our properties for service providers to offer high quality child care.”Christine Hui, director, Doxa Education Group –“We are grateful for the funding from the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund. This will allow us to better serve the children and the families of Burnaby. We have a vision to create a high-quality child care centre where it will be more than just a place parents drop off their children, but a place where children grow and develop a strong sense of self, love, collaboration and creativity. This funding will contribute significantly to actualize our vision.”Janet Routledge, MLA for Burnaby North –“Parents have been struggling for too long to find affordable child care, and the shortage of spaces has had a real impact on our community. Many people are faced with travelling long distances to find care, adding to their daily commute. These new spaces will help bring child care closer to home and make life easier for families.”Anne Kang, MLA for Burnaby-Deer Lake –“New child care spaces will make it easier for parents to return to work or school, knowing their children have safe, quality care. With these investments, we are making life better for families and strengthening our local economy.”Raj Chouhan, MLA for Burnaby-Edmonds – “These new child care spaces will make a big difference for many families in the community. Creating new child care spaces is just one more way we are making life more affordable for families.”Quick Facts:\\nIn January 2020, the Province launched a new professional development program, which is giving early childhood educators (ECEs)\\xa0access to more than 30 teaching specialists at community hubs throughout B.C., helping them stay up to date on the latest child care teaching trends and techniques.\\nThe Province has made significant investments to improve supports to B.C.’s early care and learning professionals, including investing approximately $16 million to provide more than 5,400 bursaries for students pursuing a career in child care.\\nTo date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide more than 11,500 ECEs with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, with another $1-per-hour lift to come in April 2020.\\nQuick Facts about child care in Burnaby:\\nThis recent investment in 682 spaces means that a total of 977 new licensed child care spaces have been funded in Burnaby since July 2018.\\nThe school district projects are being created as part of their $35.7-million plan to add nearly 800 new child care spaces to the community.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Province is providing almost $9 million to help 89 local governments and First Nations throughout British Columbia prepare so their homes, businesses and communities are better protected against the threat of wildfires.“Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities are on the front lines of wildfire prevention, and we removed barriers so our Community Resiliency Investment program met their needs,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “We fund up to 100% of local projects and projects that include Crown land because we know wildfires don’t distinguish between municipal, on-reserve and provincial Crown land.”Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, announced the third round of 89 Community Resiliency Investment grants during a visit to recipients in the Interior. (The recipients and their projects are listed in a backgrounder.)“The people who call these communities home know all too well the dangers from wildfires,” said Kahlon. “Our government is committed to supporting local governments and First Nations because it’s their on-the-ground efforts and local knowledge that are crucial to protecting the economic, recreational and environmental lifeblood of their communities.”Among the recipients is the Penticton Indian Band, which will use $150,000 to reduce buildup of flammable material like wood debris, branches and undergrowth from high risk areas near homes and crucial infrastructure. The Penticton Indian Band has been a recognized FireSmart community since 2016.“Caring for our lands, including the health of our forests, is an inherent right and responsibility we as Syilx Okanagan People take seriously and are working with many levels of government ministries through agreements like this,” said Chief Chad Eneas of the Penticton Indian Band. “Fuel management supports us to protect the cultural and heritage value of our forests, as well as ensure they can contribute to a sustainable economy for many generations.”Kahlon met with the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen, which received $140,000 to update an Official Community Plan to incorporate FireSmart principles for keeping homes, neighbourhoods and communities safe. Funding will also be spent on a FireSmart educator, for public outreach and education.Kahlon’s two-day visit will take him to Osoyoos, Summerland and Merritt to meet with representatives from multiple communities from the Kamloops and Southeast fire centres.The B.C. government has committed $60 million to the Community Resiliency Investment program to help local governments and First Nations reduce the risk of wildfire through the promotion and use of FireSmart principles. The program, launched in September 2018, replaces the Strategic Wildfire Prevention Initiative.The number of Community Resiliency Investment program grants allocated provincewide to date is now 209, amounting to more than $18.6 million.Mitigating wildfire threats is a shared responsibility of the provincial government, local governments, First Nations, industry, stakeholders and individual British Columbians. The Community Resiliency Investment program helps increase community resiliency by funding activities that promote FireSmart education, planning and opportunities for partnerships through regional FireSmart committees. A key component of the program is that it lets communities apply for funding to cover up to 100% of a wildfire risk reduction project.The Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM) administers the Community Resiliency Investment program’s FireSmart Community Funding and Supports category and processes grant applications in partnership with the ministry and the First Nations’ Emergency Services Society of B.C. Eligible applicants facing a lower wildfire risk can apply for up to $25,000, while applicants facing a demonstrated higher wildfire risk can apply for up to $150,000.Quote:Karla Kozakevich, chair, Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen –“Reducing wildfire risks and increasing our community’s resiliency to wildfire impacts are ongoing challenges.

But in response her employer demanded that she show up at work happy.\\xa0For her, it was\\xa0impossible.

For Indigenous women and girls, gender-diverse people and those with disabilities, the incidents of violence are even greater. These women are our neighbours, friends, people we see in the grocery store and faces in a crowd.This week, I was so proud to be in the B.C. legislature, alongside the Minister of Labour, Harry Bains, to introduce changes to the Employment Standards Act that provide paid leave for people who have faced domestic or sexual violence. This means that someone facing this type of violence knows they can have the space and time to go to medical appointments, counselling and make the necessary changes to ensure they and their children are safe. For many, losing even a day’s wages traps them in an unsafe relationship and puts their safety in jeopardy.We all recognize the painful challenge for people who are trying to keep working when their life has been shattered. Often, their lives will never be the same.

       "  \"\\n\\nJeremy and Amanda knew that physical activity was important, but they did not know joining an urban soccer league in downtown Vancouver would be so rewarding.They are only two of the many active players in the Vancouver Street Soccer League (VSSL), a community sport program run largely in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside to support individuals who face barriers to participating in conventional organized athletics.“VSSL is a really important thing to have in a community where people are stuggling with at-risk behaviours, or they can’t afford to join a sport or they just don’t feel welcome,” said Jeremy. “The league accepts everyone who wants to join. I’ve made so many good friends through the league, it really feels like a family. I’m always telling other people they should come out and give it a try.”VSSL began 10 years ago as a mental-health program in the Downtown Eastside and has expanded considerably since then. It has partnered with several community organizations, including the Portland Hotel Society, the Carnegie Community Centre, Covenant House, the Aboriginal Friendship Centre, WorkBC and others.Over the years, approximately 325 youth from Covenant House have participated in the VSSL program, as well as hundreds of adults from at-risk groups, homeless shelters, Indigenous and immigrant/refugee communities. VSSL conducts special practice sessions for female and LGBTQ2S+ players in a secure and welcoming setting.“We have a wide variety of people from many different backgrounds participating in this league. We have come to understand just how important the VSSL community is to these players,” said Sarah White, VSSL’s president. “We practise every Thursday morning and every Sunday morning, without fail – we pride ourselves on our commitment to always be there for our players.”The social and cultural benefits of VSSL extend beyond athletics. The league invites players into a family of peers who are also trying to change their lives for the better, which can be a powerful force to inspire success.Players support and encourage each other, and espouse VSSL’s guiding principles of fair play, community building, supportive partnerships, and health and safety. League volunteers provide informal mentoring to players, including advice and support in pursuit of employment opportunities and further education.“Since joining VSSL, I’ve seen a big improvement to my fitness, my mental health and just my overall feeling about myself,” said Amanda. “That’s what sport can do for you – you get a solid foundation to build a better lifestyle for yourself.”White said, “Many of our players are First Nations, and we also have volunteers and supporters from First Nations. VSSL is regularly invited to the Father’s Day weekend soccer tournament hosted by the ‘Namgis First Nation each June at Alert Bay. Each year, it has proven to be profound and life changing for many of our league’s members. The village parade and traditional longhouse ceremonies that kick off the tournament resonate deeply with many of our players, particularly those who rarely leave the Downtown Eastside neighbourhood.“We have a growing number of recent immigrant and refugee players from every corner of the world. Soccer is the common language. With support from our sponsors, we are very excited to expand the league’s programming to increase access to as many people as possible.”This spring, the Province provided a $5,000 grant to VSSL to expand its programming to support a women's/LGBTQ2S+ team. The program is supported through the BC Sport Participation Program (BCSPP), funded equally by the governments of Canada and British Columbia, which includes sport programs, activities, and coach and leadership training in communities throughout B.C. \\xa0The BCSPP also funds the Urban Native Youth Association in Downtown Eastside Vancouver with $50,000 annually for its youth sport and recreation programs. Activities range from ju-jitsu and canoeing to lacrosse and wrestling, and are provided to about 700 youth annually. Youth are also offered training in the National Coaching Certificate Program, first aid, the High Five quality standard for children's programs, belay\\xa0and canoeing.Learn More:Vancouver Street Soccer League: https://vancouverstreetsoccer.comBC Sport Participation Program: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019TAC0102-001733\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

From well-known public figures to young activists, to those working quietly behind the scenes, they are standing up for equality. We stand with them.“No one deserves to be held back by their gender, their ethnicity or other parts of their identity.“From day one, our government has taken steps to address discrimination. These include major investments in affordable child care, which will create more opportunities for women to join the workforce or advance their careers. This addresses one of the major factors in the gender pay gap. We’re also creating bursaries and increasing wages for early childhood education workers, most of whom are women.“We are supporting women and other marginalized groups who face family-law issues, domestic and sexual violence, and poverty by improving access to legal aid and dispute resolution services. When passed, a new law giving survivors of sexual and domestic violence paid leave from work will give women the time they need to access justice and leave their abusers behind. And, as we move forward with the first major investments in transition homes for women and children leaving violence, more women and their children will have a safe place to go when they need one.“To bring down barriers for women in trades, we’ve created the Community Benefits Agreement for\\xa0major projects that prioritizes hiring and training women, Indigenous peoples and others who traditionally have been shut out of these jobs.“While we have taken meaningful strides in British Columbia, there is still much more to do to achieve gender equity.

       "  '\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.\\'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:\"We are announcing six new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 27 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions, and were confirmed positive based on testing by the BC Centre for Disease Control.“Case 22 is a man is his 50s, who recently returned from travel in Iran. Case 25 is a woman in her 50s and a close household contact of case 22. Both individuals reside in the Fraser Health region.“Cases 23 and 24 were passengers on the Grand Princess cruise ship from Feb. 11 to 21. They are a man and woman, both in their 60s, and are receiving care in hospital in the Fraser Health region.“Cases 26 and 27 are residents of a long-term care facility, the Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. These cases were identified as part of an outbreak assessment at the facility in response to a staff member testing positive for COVID-19. The staff member is Case 21, a woman in her 50s, who has no recent travel history.“All residents of this facility have now been screened and Vancouver Coastal teams are on site to support the families and continue to investigate in detail. Public health teams have notified facility staff and residents, and are meeting with their families.“Case 13, a woman in her 80s, continues to receive care at Vancouver General Hospital. She is now in stable condition. All precautions have been taken to ensure the safety of other patients and health-care workers, while providing her with the care she needs.\\xa0“All other individuals with COVID-19 are stable and in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams. So far, four of B.C.’s 21 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 have fully recovered.“There has been a notable transmission of COVID-19 at events, such as religious gatherings. As a result, we recommend social distancing and forgoing usual greetings. As an alternative, we recommend considering virtual online gatherings.“Cruise ships continue to be a high-risk environment for transmission. As result, we recommend reconsidering any cruise-ship travel at this time.“We continue widespread testing by screening British Columbians and travellers with symptoms, along with their close contacts, to identify cases of COVID-19 and take immediate action as we have seen today. As of March 6, 2020, 2,803 samples have been tested.“The British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Co-ordination Plan details the preparations and comprehensive toolkit to respond to the evolving outbreak.

       "  \"\\n\\nTo protect people in B.C. against novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and mitigate the impact of this illness on communities, the B.C. government and the provincial health officer have developed the British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Co-ordination Plan to respond to the evolving outbreak. \\xa0Premier John Horgan has appointed a deputy ministers' committee to oversee a whole-of-government approach to implementing the plan, reporting directly to a new cabinet committee that he and Health Minister Adrian Dix will co-chair.“From the first day the world learned of this outbreak, B.C.’s public health officials have delivered the most robust response of any jurisdiction in this hemisphere. Through this co-ordination plan, we will ensure they have the support they need so we are prepared for all possibilities,” Premier Horgan said.B.C.’s COVID-19 pandemic response plans include a wide range of planning and preparedness actions to help individuals, local governments, health-sector organizations and businesses to plan for the possibility of a pandemic. The plan focuses on delaying, containing and preparing the province to minimize serious illness and economic disruption.“The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve here in B.C., Canada and other countries in the world. We are at a critical point in the fight against the virus and we will ensure B.C.’s health system and population are ready for any scenario,” Dix said.\\xa0Phase 1 of the plan is underway, addressing identification and containment -- continuing strong public health testing and close collaboration with the federal government on border surveillance, to identify and isolate individuals who test positive for the virus and their close contacts. The priority is to delay the onset of widespread community transmission for as long as possible.Phase 2 would escalate cross-government co-ordination to quickly direct actions and resources, as required. It also prepares for the use of emergency powers set out in the Emergency Program Act and Public Health Act. It would ensure provincial business and service continuity – with four priorities:\\n\\nProtecting Population\\nProtecting Vulnerable Citizens\\nProtecting Health Workers\\nSupporting Health-care Capacity\\n\\nProtecting Population actions would include increasing testing capacity and expanding communication with at-risk groups. It would also enact government continuity plans to prepare for the possibility of high absence rates due to illness, or if employees are absent in order to care for family. It would also provide supports for businesses and institutions to manage the same challenges through a sustained three- to four-month outbreak; including grocery stores, public transportation, schools and the tourism sector.\\nProtecting Vulnerable Citizens actions would include ways to protect seniors in long-term care, assisted living and home and community care, which could include reducing the number of people coming into facilities, screening visitors and increasing testing for illness of residents and health-care workers.\\nProtecting Health Workers actions would include implementing standardized preparedness plans at the local level to support health-care workers to respond to a wider outbreak and provincially manage and co-ordinate supply chains for hospital, community and primary care. It would also bring in additional health-care capacity for specific communities under stress by establishing a list of health-care workers who could be rapidly redeployed for a sustained period.\\xa0\\nSupporting Health-Care Capacity actions would use established emergency operation committees across health authorities to assess the ability to plan and respond at a local level to a community-wide outbreak and create capacity, as needed, in hospitals for:\\n\\ndischarging low-risk patients;\\ndeferring scheduled surgeries and procedures;\\nidentifying capacity for new care spaces within hospitals; and\\nensuring bed equipment capacity.\\nIt would also ensure readiness to implement hospital-wide protocols to safely triage and separate anyone presenting with respiratory illness.\\xa0“The COVID-19 pandemic response plans and materials are developed in partnership with our experts at the BC Centre for Disease Control, based on our provincial influenza pandemic plans that all health authorities had implemented in 2012, as well as the lessons we had learned from H1N1 and SARS in the past,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. “Thanks to the great efforts made by our public health leaders and health-care workers, we have kept the risk of COVID-19 spread low in B.C., but it is important for people, communities and organizations to build resiliency and have plans in place, not just for the possibility of a pandemic but emergency in general.”Of British Columbia’s 21 confirmed COVID-19 cases, four B.C. patients have now fully recovered. With the exception of one patient who is in the intensive care unit at Vancouver General Hospital, all other individuals with COVID-19 are in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.As of Friday, March 6, 2020, the BC Centre for Disease control has tested 2,803 samples for 2,008 people.Learn More:For the COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and planning materials, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/pandemic-influenza.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19For more information and latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit the website: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

It presents a number of ideas for discussion, including:\\noptional rate designs to encourage the shift from fossil fuels to electricity in vehicles, homes and businesses and achieve the emission reduction targets in CleanBC;\\nmeasures to expand the electrification of B.C.’s growing economy and attract new, clean businesses to B.C., creating jobs and opportunities;\\nchanges to give BC Hydro more flexibility to meet future demand for clean electricity at the least cost to keep rates affordable;\\na 100% clean electricity standard, which would be the first provincial standard of its kind in Canada; and\\nkey issues and themes related to enhancing Indigenous Nations’ participation in the energy sector and furthering reconciliation.\\nThe Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources will now gather further feedback from stakeholders, customer groups and Indigenous Nations and organizations based on the interim report. This feedback will support the development of recommendations for a final report to be completed later in 2020.Phase 2 of the review will position BC Hydro for long-term success and support the development of its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) to be filed with the B.C. Utilities Commission in early 2021. The IRP outlines how BC Hydro plans to safely provide reliable, affordable, clean electricity to meet customers’ needs now and into the future.Phase 1 of the review was completed in February 2019. It resulted in immediate actions to contain BC Hydro’s costs, keep rates affordable and expand independent oversight by the B.C. Utilities Commission.

       "  \"\\n\\nThe Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in the Capital Regional District (CRD) by investing in 462 new spaces, including seven projects with local school districts.\\xa0“Adding child care to school grounds is a win for everyone – it gives kids a smoother transition into elementary school and offers convenience for parents,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “This partnership with the local school districts is bringing hundreds of spaces to families across the city. With proposed changes to the School Act, making it easier for school districts to deliver child care, we hope to see even more of these partnerships in the future.”Partnerships with both the Greater Victoria (SD 61) and Saanich (SD63) school districts will bring more than 300 child care spaces to elementary schools across the region. These spaces will be operated by local non-profit societies, with programming to be inclusive and teach children about local Indigenous cultures.“The news of increased before- and after-school child care for Cordova Bay Elementary couldn't come at a better time,” said Heidi Low, president, Cordova Bay Elementary Parent Advisory Council. “As our school and community populations increase, we are thrilled to be able to offer more child care spaces for our families.”Recent changes to the School Act will make it easier for school boards to create and operate before- and after-school care. The changes will also require school boards to create an inclusive child care policy, and prioritize space that is not being used for K-12 students for child care.“We know families want safe and convenient after-hours school care and we are committed to supporting them with programs on school grounds that are already designed to help grow young minds,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Our record, $2.8-billion school capital budget is allowing us to continue adding new child care spaces at neighbourhood learning centres as part of our plan to build, expand and replace schools in every corner of B.C.”Four other projects in the Victoria region will create an additional 150 spaces for families. The City of Colwood is partnering with West Shore Parks and Recreation Society to create 40 school-age spaces, while the Esquimalt Nation is building a new 36 space child care centre. Saanich Neighbourhood Place is adding 49 spaces to its child care facility and Christ Church Cathedral Education Society is opening a new junior kindergarten with 25 spaces for children, ages 3 to 5.The investment means that since the New Spaces Fund launched in July 2018, almost 1,400 new, affordable licensed child care spaces in the CRD have been funded as part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in the Capital Regional District save nearly $30 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Tim Dunford, board chair, Saanich Board of Education –“The Saanich Board of Education is proud to partner with the Province to provide families with much-needed child care space expansion. We understand how important accessibility to child care is for families and that additional space is needed in our community. The board of education is excited for this opportunity to collaborate with the Province and our valued child care operators to better support students and families by expanding accessible child care spaces on our school sites.”Mitzi Dean, MLA for Esquimalt-Metchosin –“For too long, families in Greater Victoria haven’t been able to access quality, affordable child care. By partnering with school districts, our government is making it easier for families to access child care exactly where they need it – before and after school in the same facility. By working together, we are making it more convenient and efficient to access these important services.”Carole James, MLA for Victoria-Beacon Hill –“We are thrilled to be able to collaborate with school districts to create more child care spaces for families right here in Victoria and across the province. It is just one way we are making things more affordable for families.”Adam Olsen, MLA for Saanich North and the Islands –“The first years of a child’s life are a phase of incredible neural development, and every child deserves care that is nurturing, engaging, safe, fun and close to home. This work has been foundational to the minority government, and the BC Green caucus\\xa0will continue to prioritize the creation of new public child care and early childhood spaces, as well as strive to better support the dedicated educators caring for our youngest citizens.”Lana Popham, MLA for Saanich South –“I’m so excited that families in Saanich South will soon benefit from 60 new child care spaces. There are many young families in this community that have told me that access to child care will make a big difference in their lives.”Quick Facts:\\nThe Greater Victoria and Saanich school districts have been leading the way in creating school-based child care for local parents. Since July 2018, they have received funding for more than 800 new licensed child care spaces in the region.\\nTwo child care centres in Victoria are also providing child care for no more than $10 a day, as part of the Childcare BC Universal Prototype Sites Program.\\nThe municipalities of Central Saanich, Highlands, North Saanich, Saanich, Sidney and Oak Bay are sharing a $150,000 grant through the UBCM Community Child Care Planning Grant Program to help create a long-term child care plan to support families in the community. The City of Victoria also received $23,300 to develop a child care plan.\\nTo date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide more than 11,500 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, with another $1-per-hour lift to come in April 2020. The Province has provided more than $1.4 million to early childhood educators in the CRD\\xa0through the wage enhancement.\\nLearn More:For more about Childcare BC, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcareTo learn more about the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund and to apply, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/newspacesfundTo find child care in your community, view the online child care map: http://maps.gov.bc.ca/ess/hm/ccf/Child care factsheet: https://news.gov.bc.ca/18430For more information on the Childcare BC Universal Prototype Sites, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcareprototypesitesFor more information about child care in Victoria, visit: www.childcarevictoria.orgFor more information about proposed changes to the School Act, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/21641A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nFirst Nations people can look forward to significant changes in the justice system following a decision by the BC First Nations Justice Council (BCFNJC) and the Province to endorse and sign a new First Nations Justice Strategy.The BCFNJC’s action is supported by resolutions from the BC Assembly of First Nations, the Union of BC Indian Chiefs and the First Nations Summit.“It is an honour to be part of the first justice strategy for Indigenous peoples in British Columbia that is authored by Indigenous peoples themselves,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “That it took this long to happen is tragic. That it is finally happening should bring hope for a better future. I look forward to working with Indigenous peoples and leaders across the justice sector on this historic initiative.”The First Nations Justice Strategy sets a path for the partners involved in the strategy and the criminal justice system to work together to:\\nreduce the number of First Nations people who become involved with the criminal justice system;\\nimprove the experience of those who do;\\nincrease the number of First Nations people working within the justice system; and\\nsupport First Nations to restore their Indigenous justice systems and structures.\\n“The First Nations Justice Strategy provides direction for the transformation of a system that has been pulverizing our people for generations,” said Doug White, chair, BCFNJC. “We have sought partnership with the Government of B.C. to reshape the criminal justice system and to begin to build the path to true Indigenous justice systems that are rooted in Indigenous self-determination and authority.”Work will begin by engaging impacted government ministries on the development of a joint implementation plan, recognizing that many of the strategies will take further engagement and funding, along with the involvement of the federal government.\\xa0The joint strategy is born out of a 2017 memorandum of understanding between the Government of B.C. and BCFNJC. It is based on engagement with First Nations leadership, ministries, non-profits and police services that work within the existing criminal justice system.“Under the strategy, BC Corrections will play a critical role in improving the experience of Indigenous people who become involved with the criminal justice system,”\\xa0said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “So much of what’s happening in corrections is being led and shaped by Indigenous peoples. That’s what makes the joint strategy so promising: it’s First Nations led.”Strategy highlights include:\\na two-path approach that transforms the existing criminal justice system and builds the path toward restoring First Nations laws and justice systems;\\nestablishing a network of 15 regional First Nations Justice Centres around the province;\\ndeveloping a systemic approach to implementing\\xa0the Gladue decision;\\nestablishing a presumption of diversion to divert First Nations people from the court system, wherever possible;\\nimproving cultural competency in the justice system;\\nestablishing roles for Elders and Knowledge Keepers within the justice system; and\\nincreasing community justice programming in each First Nations community.\\nOver the coming months, Ministry of Attorney General staff and the BCFNJC will continue working together to develop plans to implement the strategy.Quotes:Don Tom, vice-president, BC Union of Indian Chiefs – “Indigenous women and girls are over policed and under protected. As reported by the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls report and Human Rights Watch, Indigenous women who are survivors of crime often don’t trust the police enough to report it and face criminalization when they do. When involved in the criminal justice system, Indigenous women and girls are more likely to plead guilty, receive longer sentences and less likely to have adequate legal representation. They serve longer sentences for most of their crimes, which are administrative in nature and poverty related, and Gladue requirements are rarely met. This strategy brings justice system attention and resources to creating better justice system outcomes for women and girls.”Regional Chief Terry Teegee, BC Assembly of First Nations –“This strategy creates the necessary space for recognition and implementation of Indigenous justice systems. First Nations will have the opportunity to restore and reclaim their legal systems and structures according to specific traditions, laws, knowledge, experiences and contexts. This will necessarily include the expansion of many community-based justice programs, which are vital to testing and advancing transformation of the justice system.”Lydia Hwistum, First Nations Summit Task Group –“Twenty-one years after the landmark Gladue court decision, Indigenous incarceration rates in B.C. have tripled to over 30%. This unjust reality amounts to an astonishing crisis in Canadian society arising from the failure of the criminal justice system to embrace clear direction from Parliament and the Supreme Court of Canada. Now, through the First Nations Justice Strategy, our shared commitment is to tackle this unjust intransigence and create systemic change in a comprehensive and integrated way across the criminal justice system to ensure fair and equitable treatment of Indigenous peoples.”Learn More:Read the 2020 First Nations Justice Strategy: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/First_Nations_Justice_Strategy_Feb_2020.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

On the Coast, the training materials will be integrated into existing programs at North Island College and\\xa0 Vancouver Island University.“The forestry sector is facing slowdowns that were years in the making, but there remains a need in some areas for new workers,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Ensuring students have the skills the forestry sector needs to grow supports economic development and provides good jobs for entry-level workers.”In addition to earning safety certificates, students will learn skills required for forestry jobs ranging from tending tree stands to mechanical harvesting. Small class sizes of six to eight students and interactive learning will allow students to gain knowledge and skills, including chainsaw operation and wildland firefighting.“Meeting the training needs of new workers ensures they’re not left behind as the forestry sector continues to adapt,” said Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Employers will also benefit when new employees come to the table job-ready with skills and improved safety awareness.”Approximately $500,000\\xa0for the project is from the Sector Labour Market Partnerships Program through the Canada-BC Labour Market Development Agreement.The funding is in addition to the $12 million the Province committed to retraining initiatives, as part of an overall commitment of $69 million to support impacted communities, workers and employers in the forestry sector.Quotes:Rob Moonen, CEO, BC Forest Safety Council —“The entry-level forestry worker training program provides students a basic understanding of general forestry occupational skills, legislation and regulation, and aligns with on-the-job worker competency assessments developed by BCFSC. That means future employers will be able to see what has already been covered in workers’ training, and what still needs to be taught on the job.”Jake Roos, Okanagan College instructor and owner, Loki Tree Service —“The strength of this program is that it combines the supportive learning\\xa0environment of the college with local contractors and practical field experience. It recognizes that good, efficient forest work requires an early understanding of professionalism and safety. Students can expect to leave with knowledge about the fundamentals of modern forestry in B.C. and industry contacts with which to initiate their career.”Quick Facts:\\nTuition-free programs are being offered by:\\nCoast Mountain College - Terrace\\nSelkirk College - Grand Forks\\nCollege of New Caledonia – Vanderhoof\\n\\nOkanagan College delivered the program at its Revelstoke campus in 2019.\\nStudents are advised to contact these post-secondary institutions directly for more details.\\nLearn More:BC Forest Safety Council: http://www.bcforestsafe.org/To read about how the B.C. government supports Interior forestry workers, contractors and communities, visit: https://forestryworkersupport.gov.bc.ca/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Eligible fire departments include local governments, First Nations communities and society-run departments.“Volunteer and composite fire departments are vital public safety partners in B.C.’s local and First Nations communities,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “This funding for new equipment and training will support dedicated fire crews at more than 100 of these fire departments as they continue their work to keep communities safe.”This $5 million in funding is part of an additional $69.5 million investment in the CEPF with an expanded eligibility to include volunteer and composite fire departments in First Nations communities. This is part of an initiative by EMBC to increase resiliency across all communities in British Columbia and improve B.C.’s overall emergency management system.“It’s great to see so many communities take advantage of this funding,” said Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness. “It’s our hope that these funds will help build resiliency across B.C. by ensuring local governments and First Nations have the tools they need to be ready for all hazards.”\\xa0Though the maximum amount of funding per applicant is $25,000, in many cases, regional districts submitted proposals involving many societies and fire departments. That means that in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars are going to regional districts to be further distributed.The Province announced this sixth stream of CEPF funding for volunteer and composite fire departments in May 2019. In addition, the Province created a seventh stream, with $1 million for Indigenous Cultural Safety and Cultural Humility Training.For a backgrounder, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/CEPF_$5M_FireDept_funding_backgrounder.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

It’s a critical shift, and they have adapted and developed excellent strategies to showcase B.C. products while ensuring patients receive quality, nutritious, local food.”To encourage, inspire and support the shift to B.C. foods, the Ministry of Health partnered with the Ministry of Agriculture and all of B.C.’s health authorities to implement Feed BC in health-care facilities. The Ministry of Health directed health authorities to annually report their progress on tracking and sourcing more B.C. food, beginning in 2018-19.“The information is so important because it shows we’re making excellent progress toward achieving our Feed BC health-care target,” said Popham. “Serving B.C. food connects patients and residents to farmers, ranchers, fishers and food processors across the province, supports both the health and agriculture sectors, and contributes to provincial food security, helping build a more resilient and sustainable food sector in B.C.”Feed BC is a provincial government priority to increase the use of foods grown and processed in B.C. in government-supported facilities. Led by the Ministry of Agriculture, Feed BC builds capacity and support along the food service supply chain to bring more\\xa0local foods to patients, residents, students and clients throughout the province.While procuring B.C. foods is a priority for health authorities, protecting the health and safety of vulnerable patients is paramount. All food products, including those produced and processed in B.C., must comply with the highest standards for food safety, nutrition, allergens and traceability.Feed BC has given health authorities clear direction and provided additional supports. Food budgets, however, have not changed.

       "  'Legislation introduced to transform ICBC, deliver lower rates',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nLegislation has been introduced to transform ICBC, deliver lower auto-insurance rates and dramatically improve care benefits, making ICBC more accountable to British Columbians.“British Columbians deserve peace of mind that if they are injured in a crash, they’ll be looked after, instead of being fought for years in court,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “They deserve low and stable car insurance rates. This bill will achieve both goals, saving people an average of 20% on their insurance and taking care of people if they are injured. It is long overdue.”If amendments to the Insurance Vehicle Act are passed, this new way of doing auto insurance in B.C. will lower premiums on average by 20%, saving drivers about $400, starting in May 2021. ICBC’s proposed Enhanced Care coverage will also significantly increase the amount of care and recovery benefits available to anyone injured in a crash, providing enough care for a lifetime for those who need it, to a maximum of at least $7.5 million, up from $300,000 today.Wage loss payments will be 60% higher than today, to a maximum of up to $1,200 per week or 90% of net wage loss for those earning up to $93,400 annually. The most seriously injured will get even more care and recovery benefits, including a new permanent impairment benefit that will provide financial compensation of up to $250,000.Other proposed changes to the Insurance Vehicle Act formalize ICBC’s ability to offer injured people pre-litigation payments. By putting this process in legislation, an injured person who qualifies can have confidence that their ability to sue is preserved when they accept an up-front pre-litigation payment. Before this change was announced in January 2020, if a person decided to take ICBC’s settlement, they had to agree to not seek additional money through the courts. Pre-litigation payments can be offered to people injured in car crashes that occur prior to May 1, 2021, when ICBC’s Enhanced Care coverage would take effect.Amendments to the Insurance Corporation Act will eliminate the authority of any government to direct ICBC to make payments to government from its excess optional capital. Between 2009 and 2016, the previous government transferred $1.2 billion from ICBC’s excess optional capital to lower its own borrowing requirements.“ICBC should be accountable to British Columbians, and this bill, if passed, should give increased confidence that ICBC will be accountable to them by delivering lower rates and high-quality benefits in the event of a crash,” Eby said. “The changes in this bill won’t just benefit people injured in crashes next spring, they will benefit people injured now. The changes will also help us keep costs low for drivers until May 1, 2021, when drivers will enjoy some of the lowest rates in Canada.”Should the amendments be passed and receive royal assent, any government would be prohibited from accessing ICBC’s excess optional insurance capital as of the end of this fiscal, and the Enhanced Care coverage would apply to accidents on or after May 1, 2021.Quotes: Tanya Fawkes-Kirby, managing director, Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists, B.C. Branch –\\xa0“It’s the goal of an occupational therapist to help clients to return to their daily activities as quickly as possible. But the reality is that it often takes a lengthy period of time to recover from an automobile accident. These changes will provide our clients with better recovery support, for as long as they need it so they can return, as much as possible, to their pre-crash activities.”Justina Loh, executive director, Disability Alliance BC –“If a person becomes catastrophically injured in a motor vehicle collision, we want to ensure that they will get the medical treatment and rehabilitative equipment they need. Even in situations where a person caused the collision, or was involved in a single-vehicle crash, we are encouraged that severely injured people will be able to access the increased care and benefits for their lifetime.”Learn More:For more information about changes to improve transparency and accountability at ICBC, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0006-000165For more information about keeping ICBC surpluses within ICBC, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0016-000358To see ICBC’s Enhanced Care coverage, visit: http://icbc.com/2021Government’s intended changes at ICBC can be seen here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/download/000BAC79D98D4E14AAFCBBD582883BAD\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nTo improve visitor experience, camping in Golden Ears Provincial Park will be 100% reservable during peak season, from May to September.The popularity of camping in BC Parks has grown significantly over the years. This has created a demand for more reservation opportunities, so everyone has fair and equal access to campsites regardless of where they live.Given its location in the Fraser Valley and proximity to Vancouver, Golden Ears is one of the busiest parks in the province, with approximately 132,000 campers in 2019 – a 20% increase since 2012. The park has 423 vehicle accessible sites, 20 walk-in sites, two group sites and 40 marine sites at Alouette Lake.Last year, 594 new campsites were added to 13 provincial parks and 12 recreation sites. Sixty-five of those sites were added to Golden Ears Park. In addition, the park now has a satellite connection that allows the public to see real-time inventory and vacancies, and make same-day reservations.\\xa0Quick Facts:\\nOf the 10,700 campsites BC Parks manages throughout the province, 55% are reservable and 45% remain available on a first-come, first-served basis.\\nTen campgrounds have 100% reservable sites during peak season – Rathtrevor Beach, Gordon Bay, Cultus Lake, Sasquatch, Alice Lake, Porteau Cove, Swiws, Bear Creek, Wells Gray and Okanagan Lake.\\nThe campgrounds still permit first-come, first-served opportunities if campsites are available, which is often possible mid-week when the demand is lower.\\nLearn More:For more information about Golden Ears Park, visit: http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/golden_ears/Reservations can be made online: https://discovercamping.ca/bccweb/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nSix new digital railway crossing signs are now live, helping reduce travel delays for drivers in the City of Langley, Township of Langley and Surrey.The Railway Crossing Information System (RCIS) will keep drivers informed with real-time train crossing information, allowing them to choose the quickest route.The RCIS operates by detecting trains approaching railway crossings, recording their presence, direction and speed. This information is sent to the central control system, which calculates the train direction and approximate arrival time at each crossing. Each sign displays the status of nearby railway crossings – open or closed – allowing drivers to make informed decisions to use nearby rail overpasses or local street networks. The signs also increase travel time efficiency and reliability for emergency responders.RCIS is the latest intelligent transportation system installed in the Lower Mainland to help reduce traffic congestion and lower greenhouse gas emissions, with fewer vehicles idling at blocked rail crossings. The signs complement the railway overpasses constructed in the Langley and Surrey area along the Roberts Bank rail corridor that were built to improve traffic flow, while enhancing trade with the Asia-Pacific region. The signs increase community liveability by mitigating the traffic impacts from increased goods movement along the Roberts Bank rail corridor, which has as many as 22 train crossings per day.The RCIS is a pilot project integrating train detection and intelligent transportation systems. It was developed specifically for the unique road and rail network in Surrey and Langley.The\\xa0project is jointly funded by the Government of B.C., Transport Canada and the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority — each providing $300,000 — in addition to $2.9 million from TransLink, for a total project cost of $3.8 million. It is the final component in the $307-million Roberts Bank Rail Corridor Program completed in 2015.Learn More:For sign locations and to learn more about the RCIS, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-infrastructure/projects/railway-crossing-information-system\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

All of these new cases reside in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and have recently returned from travel to Iran.“Case 10 is a man and in his 60s and case 11 is a woman. They have no connection to previous confirmed cases. Case 12 is a woman in her 30s and a close contact of the eighth case, previously reported on Feb. 29.“These new cases have been confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing. Four B.C. patients have now fully recovered, and the other individuals with COVID-19 are in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.\\xa0“Vancouver Coastal Health continues to actively investigate these new cases. Close contacts are being identified and contacted by public health officials.

We recommend cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve and disposing of tissues appropriately. To further contain transmission, we also recommend suspending usual greetings such as handshakes, hugs and kisses.“For you and your family, similar to how you may need to care for someone with influenza, you want to ensure you have sufficient food, medications and support in place to stay home for a number of days. These are normal preparations when someone in your family is ill – there is no requirement for British Columbians to stockpile supplies.“For employers, we recommend increasing cleaning and hand hygiene availability, in addition to thinking about how to manage absenteeism through steps such as remote working or virtual meetings.“Schools should be increasing cleaning and hand hygiene, educating students on respiratory etiquette, in addition to putting mechanisms in place to support students who may be away for extended periods.“Gathering large numbers of people together can increase the risk of transmission. Event organizers should ask all participants to stay away if they are sick, returning from affected areas\\xa0or have underlying health conditions that may be impacted by respiratory illness. Organizers should also complete a risk assessment considering what is happening in the local community and who may attend the event. Local public health teams can assist with this assessment.“British Columbians with upcoming travel plans should continue to monitor the Government of Canada travel site for the latest travel advisories: www.travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories“Travellers should understand that as global efforts to contain COVID-19 continue, the availability of health care services in some areas may be limited and travel restrictions may be put in place suddenly.“We are asking all travellers returning from Iran and China to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return home to Canada.

Employees will have paid leave, allowing them to attend medical, counselling or other appointments, look for a new home or school for their children, and rebuild their lives.“Domestic and sexual violence are deeply traumatizing crimes,” said Tracy Porteous, executive director, Ending Violence Association of British Columbia. “Although the road ahead may be the most difficult one that survivors will encounter, it can make a huge difference having informed and respectful people and processes in place that provide those harmed by these crimes the time to begin to heal.“That’s where workplaces come in. In my 38 years working in this field, I have known too many survivors who have lost their jobs simply because they needed a few days away from work to deal with the aftermath of violence. Bravo to the Province for putting this support in place.”\\xa0These amendments build on improvements made to the Employment Standards Act last year that provided up to 10 days of unpaid, job-protected leave from work for those impacted by domestic or sexual violence. If passed, the new amendments will mean five of these days will be paid days.“People facing domestic or sexual violence need far more supports to help them gain control of their lives than what was previously available in our province,” said Harry Bains, Minister of Labour. “We consulted broadly, we listened to what people said and we’re making another important step to add to existing supports that will make a real difference in a person’s life when they need it the most.”This legislation was shaped by feedback from 6,261 British Columbians, as well as input from stakeholder consultation sessions and written submissions from employers, business associations and employee organizations during fall 2019. The consultation found that most people, both employers and employees, as well as organizations, support some paid leave for people affected by domestic or sexual violence.“A person facing domestic or sexual violence needs and deserves any support their community can offer them,” said Ian Tostenson, president and CEO, BC Restaurant & Food Services Association. “Paid leave will make it easier, especially for people with children, to escape abusive situations. Our membership has expressed concern about affordability, but we all agree that we, as a part of our wider community, have a responsibility to help people escape abuse in any way we can.”Improving fairness in British Columbia's workplaces is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:The What We Heard report\\xa0and more about the public consultation can be found here:\\nhttps://engage.gov.bc.ca/domesticandsexualviolenceleave/For information about employment standards, call the Employment Standards Branch at 1 800 663-3316 or visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standardsFor a video of Harry Bains, Minister of Labour, speaking about paid leave for workers facing domestic or sexual violence:\\nhttps://youtu.be/g_poF0rvDYcA backgrounder follows.Translations:For a Chinese translation:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR_Paid_domestic_violence_leave_Feb_27_2020TC.pdfFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR_Paid_Leave_French_translation.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_NR-Paid_DSV_leave-Punjabi-Mar.pdfFor a video of Harry Bains, Minister of Labour,\\xa0speaking in Punjabi about paid leave for workers facing domestic or sexual violence:\\nhttps://youtu.be/1oe2NRWEPwsFor an audio message from Bains, in Punjabi, introducing paid leave for workers facing domestic or sexual violence:\\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bcgov/2020-03-02_paid-leave-greeting-punjab-audio-only\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

We want students to thrive in dynamic, inclusive and safe learning spaces.”The Government of B.C. is investing $11.8 million for the 240-seat addition, allowing five in-use portables to be removed from the school. The construction, which will not require students to be displaced, includes a two-storey addition on the south side of the school and more parking.“This is great news for families in Chilliwack,” said Dan Coulter, chair, Chilliwack Board of Education. “Thanks to this government's commitment to investing in schools, our district will be able to get 240 kids out of portables.”The new addition is expected to be completed in time for the 2022-23 school year.\\xa0“The Vedder Elementary Parent Advisory Council (PAC) is thrilled that the creation of more seats and the removal of portables was made a priority at our school, which is bursting at the seams,” said Melanie Reuter, Vedder Elementary’s PAC president.The Province is also providing $15.4 million for a new 600-seat secondary school at the former University of the Fraser Valley North campus and $48.6 million for South Side Elementary-Middle school, which will have capacity for 930 students.The Province has announced over $91 million for Chilliwack school expansion projects in the last two years, adding 1,770 new student seats, which should eliminate the need for up to 70 of the nearly 100 portables in the district.These investments are part of government’s plan to build new and expanded schools in fast-growing communities throughout B.C.Since September 2017, the Province has announced over $1.8 billion in school capital investments for 83 projects.

       "  '\\n\\nThe technical feasibility study of a potential high-capacity transit crossing from Vancouver across the Burrard Inlet to the North Shore has completed Phase 1.Six potential options have been shortlisted to be explored further in Phase 2.“We know that people living and working on the North Shore are frustrated with traffic congestion that has been increasing for years,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “By investing in this study, our government is helping to take a serious look at solutions that expand our public transportation network to better connect communities and to help people move around freely. The results from this study will support the North Shore and surrounding communities with their long-term transportation planning.”The Province has partnered with local governments on the North Shore and in Vancouver on a feasibility study for a high-capacity transit crossing across Burrard Inlet. The first phase of the two-phase study, led by Mott MacDonald Canada, involved a brainstorm and preliminary screening of possible crossing points that could support a more transit-oriented North Shore with better connections to Vancouver and the rest of the region. It also considered the compatibility of a transit crossing with existing and future land use and the potential for affordable housing.This work resulted in six general routes that will be further explored in Phase 2 (type of crossing in parentheses):\\ndowntown Vancouver to Lonsdale via First Narrows (tunnel crossing)\\ndowntown Vancouver to Lonsdale via Brockton Point (tunnel crossing)\\ndowntown Vancouver to West Vancouver via Lonsdale (tunnel crossing)\\ndowntown Vancouver to Lonsdale via Second Narrows (new bridge crossing)\\nBurnaby to Lonsdale via Second Narrows (new bridge crossing)\\nBurnaby to Lonsdale via Second Narrows (existing bridge crossing)\\nConnecting Lonsdale City Centre with Vancouver’s metropolitan core and the regional rapid transit network is one of the recommendations put forward by the Integrated North Shore Transportation Planning Project (INSTPP), led by Bowinn Ma, MLA for North Vancouver-Lonsdale, in 2018.\\xa0Work on the remaining recommendations of INSTPP continues through Next Step (NXSTPP), a working group that includes all levels of government on the North Shore that work in partnership to improve mobility both in and around the region. This study is one way that the Province and the City of Vancouver\\xa0are helping support the NXSTPP working group.“I hear from community members every day about how transportation challenges on the North Shore impact their lives,” said Ma. “In addition to seeking convenient ways to get around, people are eager to embrace more socially, environmentally responsible modes of transportation.\\xa0This technical feasibility study to find a rapid transit solution across the Burrard Inlet\\xa0is an important step toward a third fixed-link crossing to the North Shore.”The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, the districts of North Vancouver and West Vancouver, and the cities of Vancouver and North Vancouver are contributing to fund the study. TransLink led the procurement process for this study. The results will be used to inform the development of Transport 2050, TransLink’s updated regional transportation strategy.Making investments to improve transit is part of the B.C. government’s CleanBC plan. Initiatives in the CleanBC plan aim to make transit a more-accessible and efficient option for all British Columbians – reducing congestion and carbon pollution. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.\\xa0A backgrounder, with what people are saying about the Burrard Inlet Rapid Transit Study,\\xa0follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe Province is poised to introduce legislation that will prevent any B.C. government from directing ICBC to make payments to government from its excess optional insurance capital.This will ensure that any future surpluses remain with ICBC to be used for the benefit of drivers.“For many years, the old government treated ICBC like an ATM,” said David Eby, Attorney General.\\xa0\"It raided ICBC’s profits to the tune of $1.2 billion – seriously eroding ICBC’s financial stability and leading to higher premiums. With these proposed changes, in those years when ICBC does make a profit, those funds will now stay within ICBC so they can be used to make auto insurance rates more affordable, and for other ICBC programs and services that benefit drivers.” \\xa0Government will\\xa0propose changes to the Insurance Corporation Act to prevent any future provincial government from using ICBC’s excess optional insurance capital to lower its own borrowing requirements while eroding ICBC’s financial position, as was done in the past.Between 2009 and 2016, the previous government directed ICBC to make the following payments, totalling almost $1.2 billion, to the Province from ICBC’s excess optional capital:\\n$576 million: 2009-10\\n$101 million: 2010-11\\n$237 million: 2013-14\\n$139 million: 2014-15\\n$138 million: 2015-16\\n“This legislation to keep ICBC surpluses out of government coffers is another step our government is taking to restore ICBC to a sustainable financial position so that insurance rates can stay affordable,” Eby said. “Drivers can have confidence in knowing that their auto-insurance premiums are\\xa0going toward\\xa0benefiting drivers.”This proposed legislation will be introduced in the coming days. If passed, it will help ensure ICBC’s long-term financial stability. Upcoming legislation will also deliver the changes necessary to implement the new Enhanced Care coverage starting May 2021, so drivers can see their premiums decrease by 20% on average and have increased peace of mind knowing their medical and recovery benefits will take care of them for as long as they need, if they are injured in a crash.Learn More:More information about changes to improve transparency and accountability at ICBC:\\nhttps://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0006-000165ICBC’s Enhanced Care coverage: http://icbc.com/2021Government’s intended changes at ICBC:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/download/000BAC79D98D4E14AAFCBBD582883BADFor a Punjabi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR_ICBC_Surpluses-PA.pdfFor a simplified Chinese translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR_ICBC_Surpluses-ZH.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The topics were discussed separately.“With respect to rights and title, the parties focused intensely on commitments to an expedited process to implement Wet’suwet’en rights and title. The result of these discussions was a draft arrangement that will be reviewed by the Wet’suwet’en clan members through Wet’suwet’en governance protocols for ratification.“If ratified, Minister Fraser and Minister Bennett have agreed to return to Wet’suwet’en territory to sign. If ratified, the parties agreed to implement title on an expedited basis, to co-ordinate how we work together.“This arrangement for the Wet’suwet’en will breathe life into the Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa decision so that future generations do not have to face conflicts like the one they face today. As the late chief Wah tah Kwets (Pat Namox) said in the Delgamuukw case, ‘It is up to us to create a new memory in the minds of our children.’“On the Coastal GasLink project, the parties engaged in direct discussions and explored means to come to a resolution. The Province agreed to provide further information on the project. All parties at the table recognize that the differences relating to the CGL project remain.”Debbie Pierre, executive director, Office of the Wet’suwet’en, also commented on the proposed rights and title arrangement:“This is a momentous moment. The Dini ze and Ts’ake’ze of our past left this world with no certainty and pain. Today our Dini ze and Ts’ake’ze have carried their words forward in principle.

The funding will help create a community garden, community distribution centre and kitchen facility next to the community band office. The project is part of the Nation’s goal to increase members’ access to locally grown food and deliver programming that encourages learning, sharing of traditional and cultural knowledge and hands-on participation in food growing.“Thanks to the grant, Doig River First Nation will be able to build inclusive gardening infrastructure and partnerships that will promote local food production and act as a first step towards becoming a more food secure community,” said Chief Trevor Makadahay, Doig River First Nation. “Making a space where Elders and children can gather together will enhance the health and well-being of the community. Gardening spaces will provide the community with fresh produce, which will reduce the dependency on having to travel long distances to buy groceries.”The\\xa0Province provided $3 million to the Victoria Foundation in March 2019. Of that, $1.9 million went to the Mustard Seed Food Bank to help buy its food distribution centre for southern Vancouver Island. The remaining $1.1 million helped establish the Food Security - Provincial Initiatives Fund. Six projects have received the grants available through this fund — Doig River First Nation being the sixth — for a total of $778,170.“I want to thank the Doig River First Nation for initiating this important project. Food security is a necessary part of reducing poverty and supporting strong communities,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Projects like this and the other food-security projects announced late last year are working to bring people up and out of poverty in rural and remote areas of B.C.”TogetherBC, the province’s first poverty reduction strategy, was released in March 2019 as a cross-government plan to reduce poverty. The Victoria Foundation grant supports the Province’s work by helping organizations develop local food security programs that ensure reliable access to nutritious and affordable food for people. Food security is part of increasing inclusion, making life more affordable and supporting better opportunities and reconciliation in communities in B.C.“Food security starts at the ground level, through community-based knowledge and local food systems and economies,” said Sandra Richardson, chief executive officer, Victoria Foundation. “We are delighted to see these funds going to local organizations that understand their community’s needs and contribute to achieving food security through practical, ground-level solutions.”Addressing poverty is a shared commitment between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts\\nFood Security - Provincial Initiatives Fund recipients:\\nDoig River First Nation - $112,780\\nCarrier Sekani Family Services - $114,257\\nNuxalk Nation - $114,433\\nSources Community Resources Society - $191,976\\nSouthern Stl'atl'imx Charitable Society - $216,859\\nFirst Nations Emergency Services Society - $28,170\\n\\nMore than 500,000 British Columbians experience some level of household food insecurity.\\nLearn More:TogetherBC, B.C.’s first poverty reduction strategy: https://gov.bc.ca/togetherbcThe Victoria Foundation’s food security initiatives: https://victoriafoundation.bc.ca/food-rescue-project/\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nPeople living in East Vancouver now have better access to team-based urgent and primary care with the official opening of the new REACH Urgent and Primary Care Centre (UPCC).\\xa0“The REACH UPCC will connect people\\xa0in East Vancouver and the surrounding communities with the health care they need, when they need it,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “REACH has been supporting Vancouver residents for over 50 years. Through our partnership with community stakeholders, the UPCC will provide increased access to same day appointments for urgent needs and ongoing primary care to tens of thousands of area residents who lack a primary care provider.”REACH UPCC is a partnership between the REACH Community Health Centre, the Ministry of Health, Vancouver Coastal Health, Providence Health and the Vancouver Division of Family Practice. The new centre is the second UPCC to open in Vancouver. Fifteen\\xa0UPCCs have been announced throughout B.C. under the government’s primary care strategy.More than 37,000 additional patients will benefit from the services at REACH UPCC each year. They will be seen by a team of health-care providers, including doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, licensed practical nurses, social workers, a clinical pharmacist and office staff.“I know how hard it’s been for residents in East Vancouver to find a consistent primary care provider,” said Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant. “This game-changing investment is a major win for constituents who often face long wait times at walk-in clinics. I’m proud that our government is taking action to connect patients with skilled health-care professionals that will ensure they have access to the comprehensive primary health care they need.”Shane Simpson, MLA for Vancouver-Hastings, said, “Comprehensive and patient-centred care is a much-needed service that connects patients with a network of health-care professionals, making sure their primary care needs are met. The REACH UPCC is an exciting step forward for the community of East Vancouver and will make a big difference in the lives of residents, including my family.”The centre serves two purposes. The first purpose is to provide care for people with non-life-threatening conditions who need to see a health-care provider within 12-24 hours but do not require an emergency department and do not have or cannot access their family practitioners.The second purpose is to help attach patients to a family doctor or a nurse practitioner through partnership with the Vancouver Division of Family Practice. To\\xa0facilitate this, the UPCC will connect patients either to the REACH Community Health Centre (for those with complex health needs) or to local practices. For\\xa0patients who do not have a family doctor or nurse practitioner, REACH UPCC will also engage in the necessary steps to best support their health-care needs.REACH UPCC is located in a renovated space in the REACH Community Health Centre at 1145 Commercial Dr. in East Vancouver.Quotes:Mary Ackenhusen, president and CEO, Vancouver Coastal Health —“Vancouver Coastal Health is pleased to be a key partner in enhancing access to care for more people. The new urgent and primary care centre, delivered with our partners at REACH Community Health Care, allows us to wrap health-care services around patients who need them within their own community, and provide ongoing care and support in a way that will result in better and more responsive care.”Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC —“We look forward to the integration of the REACH UPCC in hopes it will strengthen primary care in the East Vancouver area and ensure people there have access to the health-care services they need, while also supporting a longitudinal relationship between patients and their family doctor.”Dr.\\xa0Fiona Duncan, physician lead, Vancouver Division of Family Practice —“The Vancouver Division of Family Practice is excited to continue working to improve access to quality primary care for all patients. The UPCC serves patients who need access to care for urgent, non-life-threatening medical conditions and will play an important role in supporting family physicians to continue to provide high-quality primary care in the community.”Jacqollyne Keath, board chair, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC —“Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC are pleased to see that the knowledge, skills and expertise of the entire health-care team will be utilized to improve access to health care for all British Columbians through urgent and primary care clinics. We believe that this approach will be pivotal in ensuring B.C. families can access health-care services, and we are excited to see the opening of another urgent and primary care clinic in B.C.\"Nicole LeMire, executive director, REACH Community Health Centre —\"REACH Community Health has been working to improve the health of area residents for 50 years and the new urgent and primary care centre will allow us to meet the health-care needs of even more people who live and work in this vibrant community.”Learn More:To learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The person affected is visiting from Tehran, Iran and arrived in British Columbia earlier this week. The patient is in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.“The individual has been confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) testing. The individual is female, in her 60s and is staying with family in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.“Vancouver Coastal Health is actively investigating. Close contacts have been identified and contacted by public health officials. Those who may be at risk are now in isolation for 14 days and are being actively monitored for symptoms.“We are pleased to report that three additional patients who previously tested positive for COVID-19 are now fully recovered, for a total of four fully recovered patients. The other individuals continue to recover in isolation at home and under the care of public health teams. The BCCDC has completed testing on 1,425 samples for 1012 individuals as of Feb. 27, 2020.“While the risk of spread of COVID-19 within British Columbia remains low at this time, we continue to focus efforts on containing and delaying the spread of transmission, as well as preparing for the possibility of a pandemic. A pandemic is the spread of an illness to a large number of people on a global scale.“We are asking all British Columbians to do their part to prevent the transmission of infections in our communities and in our health-care system to help protect everyone in B.C.“Similar to how you may need to care for someone with influenza, you want to ensure you have sufficient food, medications and support in place to stay home for a number for days.“Employers should increase cleaning and hand hygiene availability, in addition to thinking about how they will manage absenteeism through steps such as remote working or virtual meetings.“The most important measures people can take today is to proactively prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. This includes cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve and disposing of tissues appropriately. It is also very important to stay home and away from others if you or your family are sick.“British Columbians with upcoming travel plans should continue to monitor the Government of Canada travel site for the latest travel advisories: https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/210“Travellers should understand that as global efforts to contain COVID-19 continue, the availability of health-care services in some areas may be limited and travel restrictions may be put in place suddenly.“We ask all international travellers who are returning to B.C. to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms. If any symptoms arise, limit their contact with others and connect with their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811 to determine if COVID-19 testing is needed. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.”Learn More:\\n\\nFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BG_Coronavirus_Recommendations.pdfFor more information and latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit the website: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nEnhanced guides on starting and financing farm co-operatives in B.C. will help farmers build their businesses by providing information on how to pool resources and market their products collectively.The recently updated Agricultural Co-operatives Start-Up Guide outlines an easy five-step process to help farmers create a new local co-op, while the Financing Agricultural Co-operatives Guide provides funding options for co-op farms. Supports specific to agricultural co-operatives are unique, and the updated guides will help farmers throughout B.C. work together to build their businesses and develop new markets.“There are many leading examples of co-ops in British Columbia, and across Canada, but it can be hard for a group of producers to know how to go about creating one,” said\\xa0Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.\\xa0“Our government is pleased to be teaming up with the Province to provide this guidance to producers, because the rewards of forming a co-op can be great. Co-ops continue to make important contributions to the sustainable development of our rural areas. They offer producers the advantages of large-scale business, while benefiting many individual producers.”Co-operative business models help groups of farmers by increasing their bargaining power, creating new market opportunities, lowering costs, decreasing business risks and taking advantage of economies of scale. Co-ops are often managed by members, and each member maintains their autonomy and independence, allowing farmers to support each other while also working toward a common business goal.Farmers operating small- or medium-sized farms benefit from a strengthened presence in the marketplace by working with other growers facing similar challenges and pursuing opportunities together. The co-op model helps producers of different sizes and in different locations enhance and grow economies in smaller B.C. communities.Originally produced in 1997, the updated guides include:\\ncase studies to illustrate the types, benefits and impacts of agricultural co-ops;\\nguidelines for business operations;\\nfinancing practices; and\\nreferences to additional resources that will benefit farmers interested in starting their own co-operative business.\\n“We’re creating more opportunities for farmers to get into the field and bring additional farmland into production,” said\\xa0Lana Popham, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture.\\xa0“With the updated guides, farmers can learn about the benefits of co-ops and how this model can help grow their businesses.”The guides are funded in part by Grow BC, a mandate commitment of the Ministry of Agriculture that supports new and existing farmers to develop their careers, expand local production and access affordable land. Additional funding to support the guides was provided by the governments of Canada and British Columbia through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a federal-provincial-territorial program to strengthen the agriculture, agri-food and agri-based product sector.Quotes:Andrea Harris, executive director, B.C. Co-op Association —“Co-ops have a long history of being part of B.C.’s agricultural sector. As a member services organization dedicated to supporting co-ops across the province, we’re pleased that resources such as the updated guides are available to support farmers interested in exploring co-operative solutions.”Chris Bodnar, manager, Close to Home Organics —“Co-operatives provide an alternative business structure that helps producers access services, resources and markets for their operations. It is a positive sign that B.C. is supporting a business model that helps to empower producers, reinvest profits in local communities and develop capacity within the sector.”Quick Facts:\\nIn 2019, there were approximately 86 active agri-food co-ops in B.C.\\nAn online survey of 34 B.C. agri-food co-ops conducted by Kwantlen Polytechnic University in 2019 noted that:\\n47% of respondents grow, process and/or market products produced by their members.\\n81% of respondents sell agri-food products and related farming supplies.\\n89% of respondents received $50,000 in net profits in 2018, approximately three co-ops received more than $100,000 and two received more than $5 million.\\n\\nLearn More:Agricultural Co-operatives Start Up Guide: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/agriculture-and-seafood/business-and-market-development/6877_agricultural_co-op_start_up_guide_web.pdfFinancing Agricultural Co-operatives Guide: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/agriculture-and-seafood/business-and-market-development/6877_financing_agricultural_co-operatives_booklet_web.pdfAgriculture and food co-operatives: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/download/C05037485D96487DAC92673950753361\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nForestry workers, contractors and First Nations in and around Clearwater, Vavenby and Adams Lake will benefit from the transfer of Canfor’s Vavenby forest tenures to Interfor.“Under the previous government, companies could trade tenure like they were hockey cards, and the people impacted were often the last to find out — even when it resulted in the loss of hundreds of jobs,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Our government brought in changes so that the needs of Indigenous Nations, workers and communities would have to be considered before a transfer would be approved. The official Opposition voted against those changes. That says a lot about where their priorities lie, which isn’t with rural communities in B.C.”As a result of this transfer, Canfor has committed to create a $200,000 legacy fund with the District of Clearwater to be used at the district’s discretion. In addition, Canfor will provide $150,000 over five years to the United Way and will provide $500,000 in funding to the Wells Gray Community Forest.Effective Friday, Feb. 28, 2020, the approval is for the transfer of Tree Farm Licence (TFL) 18 and replaceable forest licence A18688, located in the Kamloops Timber Supply Area near Vavenby, from Canfor to Interfor. The two licences have a combined allowable annual cut (AAC) of approximately 349,000 cubic metres per year. This includes an AAC of approximately 164,500 cubic metres per year from TFL 18 and approximately 184,500 cubic metres per year from A18688.“I talked with community leaders when I was in Clearwater, and they were clear that this tenure transfer means people in their communities will continue to have jobs,” said Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Transfer of these tenures provides a stable wood-fibre supply for the Adams Lake sawmill and Interfor’s Adams Lake division that will help those operations continue to provide jobs in the region for years to come.”The decision follows comprehensive engagement — including considerable response from the citizens of British Columbia, local governments and Indigenous Nations — to help the minister understand the extent of public interest in the transfer and to ensure it is not detrimental to the marketing of wood fibre in B.C.Further requirements include the need for Interfor to continue discussions with local secondary and value-added manufacturers in the North and South Thompson on log purchasing and wood-fibre supply agreements. Interfor must also work with displaced woodlands employees on further opportunities for employment.This is the second time Donaldson has approved a forest tenure transfer since Forest Act changes were passed in 2019. Last year, the minister approved a transfer between Hampton and Conifex that transferred tenure in the central Interior, with the requirement that Hampton would rebuild the sawmill in Fort St. James within three years.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Access Grant will break down financial barriers and enable thousands more students to get a college or university education in their chosen fields,” said Premier John Horgan. “It’s part of our government’s work to build a strong economy for everyone, where people can get good, well-paying jobs that support them and their families, and business can access more skilled workers.”The new, needs-based B.C. Access Grant will target those who need it most: low- and middle-income students. Students will receive the grant at the beginning of their studies so they can pay for tuition, textbooks, lab supplies and other items needed for their program of study.For the first time, this funding will be available for students in programs under two years in length, including certificate and diploma programs, as well as for part-time students. The changes nearly double the number of students eligible for support.“Students have been calling for this moment for almost two decades,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “The new grant will open doors to post-secondary education for thousands of British Columbians who were shut out for far too long. This is a game changer that will benefit students who need it the most, especially with their up-front costs like tuition and books. I am so proud that our government is investing in the next generation of students.”The B.C. Access Grant complements the Canada Student Grant for Full-time Students, ensuring B.C. students attending public post-secondary institutions receive up to $4,000 a year to help with the cost of programs leading to a certificate, diploma or degree.Government is investing $24 million in new funding over three years. This is in addition to approximately $37 million that government is reinvesting from existing grant programs that do not help students with the up-front costs of their post-secondary education.More than 40,000 low- and middle-income students will be eligible for the new B.C.

The reports will also help local governments support local economic growth by assessing future employment-housing needs.“Housing needs reports are a way to gather important information as we partner with local governments to create the right housing for people in communities of all sizes around the province,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “The wave of enthusiasm and interest in applying for this grant tells us that local governments are eager to collect this information to help them\\xa0build vibrant, thriving communities.”In 2018, the Province announced a $5 million investment over three years (2019-21) to help local governments collect and analyze data about their communities.

The reports will help inform council decisions about development proposals and help determine what kind of housing is needed in neighbourhoods. Thirty-one applications were approved for this year’s funding allocation. The fund is administered by the Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM).“This program is strengthening the data available on the housing supply in communities and its alignment with the current and projected needs of our residents,” said Maja Tait, mayor of Sooke and UBCM president. “Better data brings greater certainty about the types of homes that are most needed now and in coming years as demographics and populations change. I appreciate the provincial government’s continuing support to improve housing data in B.C.”Many of the successful applicants submitted proposals that include engagement with First Nations, neighbouring communities, housing providers and other stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the housing needs for their community.Since 2019, several local governments have completed their housing needs reports, including the District of Sooke, the Village of McBride, the Village of Harrison Hot Springs and the Town of Sidney, while many others are underway. Completed reports are presented to local councils and made available online to anyone seeking information on local housing needs.“The grant program enabled a detailed study that provides important data on demographics and the immediate and longer-term housing needs specific to our community,” said Cliff McNeil-Smith, mayor of Sidney. “As we now embark on a comprehensive Official Community Plan review, the report and its recommendations are a solid basis for developing targeted policies to address the ongoing housing challenges.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared commitment between government and the BC Green Party Caucus, and is\\xa0part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Aaron Stone, board chair, Cowichan Valley Regional District –“Building on the establishment of our own affordable housing service, this grant will allow us to strengthen our community planning and our engagement with the development community. We appreciate this support to help ensure our investments are creating the right housing mix to serve our diverse and rapidly growing region.”Sean Bujtas, deputy mayor, Terrace –“The City of Terrace greatly appreciates the financial support to complete a housing-needs assessment. With the economic activity and the impacts of LNG and other resource projects in the northwest, housing pressure on residents in our community is significant. Funding for this assessment will allow us to move forward and address those challenges.”Quick Facts:\\nUnder new requirements, local governments must produce their first housing needs report by April 2022 and every five years after that.\\nHousing needs reports are another tool to help the Province work with local governments and other partners to build 114,000 new affordable homes around B.C. by 2028.\\nIn the first two intakes of the Housing Needs Reports Program, over $3 million in grants have\\xa0been approved, supporting 101 municipalities and 18 regional districts with funding to help develop\\xa0their Housing Needs Reports.\\nLearn More:To see Housing Needs Reports requirements and supporting data and guidance, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/local-governments-and-housing/policy-and-planning-tools-for-housing/housing-needs-reportsFor application information on provincial funding administered by UBCM, visit: https://www.ubcm.ca/EN/main/funding/lgps/housing-needs-report-program.htmlFor a snapshot of progress on B.C.’s 10-year housing plan, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe miscellaneous statutes amendment act (Bill 13) was introduced in the legislative chamber\\xa0on Feb. 27, 2020.If approved by the legislature, the amendments will affect the following provincial statutes:Adoption Act, Assessment Act, Building Act, Evidence Act, Land Title Act, Miscellaneous Statutes Amendment Act (No. 3) 2010,\\xa0Motor Vehicle Act, New Relationship Trust Act,\\xa0Trespass Act and Vital Statistics ActMinor amendments to these ten statutes would ensure the terms of the Nisga’a Treaty are referenced correctly and are consistent with the wording of the Treaty.\\xa0Family Law Act, Family Maintenance Enforcement Act and Interjurisdictional Support Orders ActProposed amendments will lead to better assistance for\\xa0British Columbia families by enabling family justice counsellors (Family Justice Services Division), search officers (Locate Services), and enforcement officers (Family Maintenance Enforcement Program) to obtain the information they need within the framework of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.For example, amendments would clarify that parents who are receiving assistance from a family justice counsellor can share information, such as names and addresses, about other family members with the counsellor. Amendments also clarify that an enforcement officer with the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program may request the social insurance number of a debtor with significant arrears of child or spousal support to verify the debtor’s identity to enforce a support order.\\xa0Guide Dog and Service Dog ActProposed changes would streamline certification processes and clarify the relationship between the act and B.C.’s Human Rights Code. Amendments will recognize the high standards of guide and service dog training schools accredited by the International Guide Dog Federation and Assistance Dogs International by deeming guide and service dog teams from those schools to be certified under the act.Requiring these teams to undergo the formal certification process is duplicative, time-consuming and unnecessary from a public safety standpoint. The requirement for trainers to get a separate certificate for a dog-in-training in addition to the trainer certificate will also be eliminated. The amendments will address a widespread misperception that certification is mandatory for guide and service dog teams to access public places and services. The act is not intended to take away from existing protections for persons with disabilities under the Human Rights Code.Labour Mobility ActProposed amendments will correct out-of-date references to the Agreement on Internal Trade, which was replaced with the Canadian Free Trade Agreement in July 2017. As a result of its reference to the Agreement on Internal Trade, some portions of the Labour Mobility Act ceased to have legal effect when the Canadian Free Trade Agreement was implemented.The proposed amendments will update the act with the necessary references to the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, restoring the act’s original effect retroactive to July 2017.Land Owner Transparency ActMinor technical amendments would clarify public search parameters, allow for the removal of out-of-date information from the public registry and provide for the collection of additional information from transparency declarations. The act was introduced in 2019 as a key tool to combat money laundering.\\xa0Lobbyists Registration ActAmendments will correct a minor cross-referencing error.\\xa0Pharmaceutical Services Act and E-Health ActProposed minor amendments will bring legislation in line with recent changes to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, which were required to keep pace with current technology, such as cloud-based services.Supreme Court ActTo improve access to justice and reduce court delays, proposed amendments would allow the appointment of five more judges to the B.C. Supreme Court, for a total of 95 judges in addition to the chief justice and the associate chief justice.\\xa0Water Sustainability Act The Water Sustainability Act governs the allocation and regulation of the diversion, use and storage of water from streams and groundwater in B.C. The amendments are intended to make administrative corrections and provide more authority for government to collect, use and disclose the personal information of water users to ensure authorization holders, applicants, emergency responders and the public have continued access to the information needed to manage water use in B.C.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The committee was established in August 2019 to ensure the City of Surrey’s transition plan addressed all key issues, and its work has now concluded.The Surrey police board, once established, will be responsible for creating and governing\\xa0the Surrey police department. Responsibilities will include:\\nbeing the employer of the police and civilian employees;\\nproviding financial oversight for the police department;\\nestablishing policies and direction for the police department; and\\nmanaging service and policy complaints against the department.\\nTo support the transition process, the Policing Model Transition Secretariat (established in spring 2019) and the director of police services will continue to provide oversight, leadership and support for the Province and the City of Surrey. This will ensure provincial accountabilities, public safety and police oversight are maintained throughout.All parties involved acknowledge the complex scale of a transition this size and are committed to co-operation and collaboration with Public Safety Canada and the RCMP.A timeline for the transition will be determined by key partners as this work progresses.In 2018, the City of Surrey initiated termination of its agreement with the RCMP and the transition to a municipal police force, in accordance with its powers under the Police Act.Learn More:For a factsheet on the transition process, visit:\\xa0http://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/surrey-police-transition-processFor a Punjabi translation, visit: \\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Punjabi-IB-Police-Decision_on_Surrey_Police_Transition.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  'B.C. families to benefit from school-age child care on school grounds',\n",
       "  \"\\n\\nMore options for before- and after-school care are on the way for parents with the introduction of new legislation that will make it easier for boards of education to deliver licensed child care for students.“Having child care on school grounds is a win for everyone – children remain in familiar surroundings throughout their day, parents save time and money, and it keeps costs down by using facilities already enriched for learning and play,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Our government is committed to accelerating affordable, quality licensed child care spaces so families no longer have to face long wait-lists to access services that are often far from home and almost as expensive as their monthly rent.”This legislation puts into the School Act – for the first time – recognition that school boards can directly operate before and after school care. Currently, if boards want to offer child care they must offer it through a separate, licensed provider. Boards will be required to have a child care policy in place that addresses reconciliation and inclusive education commitments, while prioritizing available space on their properties not being used for K-12 students.\\xa0\\xa0To ensure families continue to have services they can count on, the legislation will allow a minister’s order to protect any spaces funded specifically for child care on school property.“I’ve heard from too many parents and experienced first-hand as a family with a school-age child, that the lack of affordable before- and after-school care in our province has meant that they cannot return to work, even after their kids start kindergarten,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “Studies show having child care at schools ensures smoother transitions for children and better educational outcomes, and it also helps parents with a single drop off and pick-up location.”\\xa0\\n\\nThese improvements build on work underway that will make it easier for school boards to work with licensed child care providers, share professional development and create inclusive, welcoming spaces for children to learn.“Almost every parent has experienced the challenge of finding good quality before and after school care for their child,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “This amendment to the School Act enables boards of education to offer that care directly, creating a natural alignment with the educational programming already offered during the school day. We applaud the government for taking this important step in ensuring more child care options for school-age children.”Families throughout B.C. have benefited from the fastest creation of child care spaces in the province’s history, with more than 10,400 being funded in 15 months. Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has also helped parents save more than $320 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative. Through these initiatives, nearly 29,000 families have received child care for no more than $10 a day, since September 2018.When a board of education wants to operate its own child care, it is eligible for operating and capital grants from the Ministry of Children and Family Development. Boards can use this funding to create non-profit child care programs based on the unique needs of their communities, with priority for culturally-relevant services for Indigenous families and support for students with special needs. \\xa0As part of the move towards making child care more accessible for families, personal education numbers (PENs) will also be expanded so children can be assigned a number before they formally start school – which is typically when they begin kindergarten at age 5. This change will reduce the paperwork that parents face and help provide seamless services from child care and early learning, to K-12 and post-secondary education throughout B.C.To ensure children have access to high-quality learning opportunities and smooth transitions throughout their entire educational journey, the Ministry of Education also updated its Early Learning Framework in November 2019 after consulting with over 600 early child care and education stakeholders. The revised framework focuses – for the first time \\xad on reconciliation and inclusive education, while expanding its scope to include infancy to eight years of age (formerly birth to five years of age).“Before- and after-school care should be seen as part of a child's comprehensive educational experience, and this change supports child care providers in that aspect of their work,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “When we begin to tap into the full potential of B.C.'s underutilized educational infrastructure, our schools will be transformed into centres with the remarkable ability to transform not just our youth but entire communities.”\\n\\nInvesting in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:\\n\\nAndrea Sinclair, president, BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils (BCCPAC) —“Parents are pleased that the government will now allow licensed child care to be operated by school boards. More than at any other time, parents are in need of strong before- and after-school, pre-school and daycare programs. These legislative changes will provide school communities the ability to work together to create better local child care solutions. BCCPAC believes the extension of the personal education number into early child care programs will help the transition of all students, but especially those with unique learning needs.”Paul Faoro, president, CUPE BC —“In addition to our long-time support for a quality, affordable public child care system in B.C., CUPE BC has long advocated that public schools are a natural home for child care spaces. It’s great to work with a government that sees the enormous potential here, all over the province.”Sharon Gregson, provincial spokesperson, Coalition of Child Care Advocates of BC —“We welcome this move to ensure school boards can run their own quality school-age child care programs. Schools are public assets and it makes sense they include before- and after-school care. This move aligns with the popular $10-a-day child care plan and it’s a significant step towards meeting the urgent need for affordable, high-quality child care in communities throughout B.C.” \\xa0Quick Facts:\\nThe Education Statutes Amendment Act, 2020, will also include amendments to improve how public K-12 education is delivered and funded in B.C.\\nSince 2017, the Province has approved over 2,600 new child care spaces on school grounds.\\nAs part of funding for new, replacement or upgraded schools, the Ministry of Education also provides extra dollars for school districts to create neighbourhood learning centres, with child care as a top priority.\\xa0\\nThe Province has also made investments to improve supports to B.C.’s early care and learning professionals, investing more than $19 million to provide over 11,500 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement. Another $1-per-hour lift is to come in April 2020.\\nTo help with recruitment and retention, the B.C. government has also created 600 new early childhood education seats at post-secondary institutions, with 4,500 post-secondary students benefiting from bursaries to pursue a career as a child care professional.\\nFunding for child care spaces and services, including before- and after-school care for school-age children, is separate from funding for K-12 education. \\xa0\\nLearn More:For more about Childcare BC, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcareTo learn more about the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund and to apply, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/newspacesfundTo find child care in a community, view the online child care map: https://maps.gov.bc.ca/ess/hm/ccf/Child care factsheet: https://news.gov.bc.ca/18430\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

We need strong communities within our schools where no student feels alone. By working together to protect and support each other with kindness, tolerance and acceptance, we’re building a safer B.C. for everyone.”Premier Horgan and Rob Fleming, Minister of Education, and MLAs were joined at the Parliament Buildings by Tru Wilson, transgender advocate; Carol Todd, parent and founder of the Amanda Todd Legacy Society; Travis Price, co-founder of Pink Shirt Day; and local students.“We all have a role to play in making sure students feel safe in the classroom, at home and online. If we work together, we can help students feel safe and encourage respectful behaviour toward others,” said Fleming. “The Erase program is continuing to provide our students with additional tools and resources to support their well-being and make a huge difference in our schools and communities.”The Erase strategy continues to grow as a comprehensive resource to better represent the issues facing youth and their communities today. Priority areas include a focus on social media and online safety, mental health and wellness, substance use, gang prevention and supporting students of all sexual orientations and gender identities.Many new resources are available for students, parents, educators and community partners in B.C. schools this year as part of an over $5.4-million investment in Erase, including:\\na $2-million provincewide investment in school-based student mental health to help ensure kids can access support when they need it, and so they feel safe and connected at school;\\n$50,000 for social media and online safety education sessions for B.C. students and parents throughout the province. These sessions are an extension of the sessions offered over the last two years;\\na new video series, Raising Digitally Responsible Youth, was created in partnership with the BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils, to help parents and caregivers understand and teach kids how to safely navigate online and protect their digital reputation at the same time;\\na new Community Violence Threat Risk Assessment Protocol Guide to foster cross-sector partnerships to keep school communities safe and provide wraparound supports to students in need; and\\nnew trauma-informed practice resources for educators to develop compassion to help children, youth and adults, especially those who have experienced traumatic events and early hardships.\\nQuotes:Tru Wilson, 16-year-old trans advocate –“I am so happy to be a part of Pink Shirt Day again\\xa0and to celebrate how this day has evolved. Today is not just about standing up against fear and hate, it's about celebrating each and every one of us who is different. Today is a day for all of us to stand together and truly lift each other up!”Carol Todd, parent and founder, Amanda Todd Legacy Society –“Together, we must actively work to ‘Lift Each Other Up’ in times when it is needed the most. Positive actions are needed in creating a society of respect and understanding. Pink Shirt Day allows us to make these changes for good by asking, ‘Who can I lift up to make a better tomorrow?’ and knowing that this is helping someone. For today and all the other days that follow, creating positive actions that make a difference is what is important and what is needed.”Travis Price, founder, Pink Shirt Day –“I am so excited to once again be part of British Columbia's Pink Day.

We set a target to reduce the overall poverty rate by 25% and the child poverty rate by at least 50% by 2024 based on 2016 data.“B.C.’s overall poverty rate was 8.9% in 2018 compared to 12% in 2016, while B.C.’s child poverty rate declined to 6.9% in 2018 from 12% in 2016. I’m pleased to see this Statistics Canada data confirm that our poverty reduction strategy is working to make life better for people. By investing in housing and child care, and by raising the minimum wage, we are helping to lift British Columbians out of poverty. These statistics are encouraging and confirm we’re on the right path, but there is still more work to do.“Since forming government in July 2017, we’ve been delivering on our priority of making life more affordable for British Columbians. We’ve increased income and disability assistance rates twice and made child care more affordable. In just over two years, 23,000 new affordable homes are completed or underway throughout the province and we’re taking action to make renting fairer for people in B.C.“With the release of the Canada Income Survey 2018, Statistics Canada also released its second comprehensive review of the market-basket measure, which establishes poverty thresholds based on the cost of necessities such as food, clothing, accommodation and transportation. It recommends increasing the costs associated with housing and accommodation, as well as transportation.“The previous government chose to ignore the housing crisis and left people behind. Our government is choosing to invest in people with a plan to build 114,000 new affordable homes through partnerships over 10 years. We also expect additional initiatives rolling out this year will reduce poverty rates. For example, the new BC Child Opportunity Benefit that comes into effect October 2020 is expected to help about 290,000 families. The elimination of MSP premiums, effective January 2020, and increases to the minimum wage are helping low-income individuals and families.”Quick Facts:\\nStatistics Canada proposes to finalize and start using the revised market basket sometime in the early summer. Applying these revisions will result in some changes to the number of people living below the poverty line but will still demonstrate a reduction in B.C.’s poverty rates.\\nAs required by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Act, the first annual report on B.C.’s poverty reduction strategy will be released by October 2020.\\nLearn More:\\xa0TogetherBC, B.C.’s Poverty Reduction Strategy:\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/TogetherBCBudget 2020: www.bcbudget.gov.bc.ca/2020Statistics Canada’s Canadian Income Survey 2018:\\xa0https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200224/dq200224a-eng.htm?HPA=1\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:“All B.C. patients with COVID-19 continue to recover in isolation at home and under care by public-health teams. In total, seven people have tested positive for COVID-19. The first individual has recovered, as indicated by the resolution of symptoms, followed by two successive negative test results 24 hours apart.“In recent days, we have seen an increasing number of countries around the world with a growing number of cases. While the risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia remains low at this time, we are watching the global evolution of COVID-19 carefully and are focusing efforts on containing the spread of COVID-19 in B.C. and in Canada.“We are preparing for all possibilities that may occur in the coming weeks, including the possibility of a pandemic. A pandemic is the spread of an illness to a large number of people on a global scale.“We are asking people to do their part in making sure they prevent transmission of infections to others in our communities and in our health-care system to best protect everyone in B.C.“The most important measures people can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, are cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you are sick.“We ask all international travellers who are returning to B.C. to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms. If any symptoms arise, limit their contact with others and connect with their primary-care provider, local public health office, or call 811 to determine if COVID-19 testing is needed. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.”Learn More:\\n\\nFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BG_Coronavirus_Recommendations.pdfFor more information and latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit the website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID-19-Updates_2020.02.25.pdf\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nFraser\\xa0Health will stop funding the Delta Hospice Society (DHS) on Feb. 25, 2021, providing the required 365-days notice to end their\\xa0service agreement without cause.The termination follows the DHS board’s refusal to comply with the provincial medical assistance in dying (MAiD) policy.The contract had provided DHS approximately $1.5 million annually. This covered 94% of the society’s costs to operate 10 beds at the Irene Thomas Hospice — a facility on land Fraser Health owns. Fraser Health will use the next year to ensure Delta residents continue to have access to those beds.“We have made every effort to support the board to come into compliance and they have been clear that they have no intention to,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “We are taking this action reluctantly, and when the role of the Delta Hospice Society concludes, patients in publicly funded hospice care will again be able to fully access their medical rights.”In 2016, the federal government passed legislation making it legal for Canadians who meet very specific criteria to have a medical professional assist them with their death. In response to that legislation, B.C. developed a policy that requires a hospice to allow patients to access MAiD in their facility, if their beds are more than 50% publicly funded.“I strongly support hospice care and we have made important investments to expand it across the province,” Dix added. “We will ensure hospice care services remain in Delta. To do that, we could restore the existing Irene Thomas Hospice site to public management. Given the significant financial contributions Delta community members made to build the facility, this would be the most desirable option. Alternatively, we could pursue another Delta site. In either scenario, the 10 hospice beds represented by the existing facility will stay in Delta.“Putting the patient first is what matters most. Patients make decisions about medical services in consultation with their doctor and their family. No organization can influence this decision or impose it. I respect anyone’s right to disagree, and no one has ever required hospice staff to deliver medical assistance in dying, but they must allow eligible residents who want the service to access it.”In the last three years, more than 3,000 British Columbians made the choice to have medical assistance in dying — the majority of those choosing to do so at home, often a long-term care facility or a hospice.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The centre is located at 1040 Hollywood Rd. South, Kelowna. No registration is required.“Prevention and intervention involves everyone, and parents can play an important role in keeping young people out of gangs,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “Sessions like this can dispel myths and help parents recognize the signs of at-risk behaviours, so they can help keep their kids on a positive path.”The gang prevention program provides education and training opportunities for students, parents, educators, law enforcement officials and representatives of community-based organizations. The Province is investing $4.93 million over the next three years to provide gang prevention and awareness training programs in 16 communities throughout British Columbia. This builds on an initial $1.12-million investment that has had more than 8,000 students, parents, educators and community partners participate in 110 training and education sessions.Parents will leave these sessions with a greater understanding of what they can do to prevent their child from getting involved in gang activity. Topics will include:\\nan overview of the current B.C. gang landscape;\\ninformation on how gang members are recruiting using social media; and\\nwhat attracts children and youth to the gang lifestyle.\\nPresenters will also discuss what gang membership entails and dispel some of the myths and realities of gang membership, as well as offer warning signs and steps to take if you think your child is involved in gang activity.Quotes:Alison Sidow, superintendent, Kamloops-Thompson School District –“In partnership with parents, our district plays a critical role in educating young people about healthy choices. The world is complex and we all have a responsibility to ensure our youth are equipped with the information they need to critically think about how their decisions affect their futures.”Kevin Kaardal, superintendent and CEO, Central Okanagan School District –“We are grateful for the Ministry of Education's continued support with the important work of gang prevention in our community.

Through applied research and technical innovation, they are building the foundations of a thriving and successful B.C.”Presidents of the 10 members of the BC Colleges association\\xa0gathered in Victoria to recognize the accomplishments of their students. For more than 50 years, B.C.’s 11 colleges have been vital community hubs throughout the province. These colleges deliver over 250 programs to more than 125,000 students annually through campuses and learning centres in 60 communities.\\xa0“Colleges serve people and communities throughout B.C. with a wide range of programs,” said Sherri Bell, chair of BC Colleges and president of Camosun College. “BC Colleges Day celebrates the life-changing education and training that is\\xa0helping create, build and maintain a thriving, healthy and vibrant British Columbia.”Indigenous students account for about 10% of the student population in the college system. At the 10 colleges in the BC Colleges association, there were 10,720 learners self-identified as Indigenous in the 2017-18 academic year, according to the ministry’s central data warehouse.\\xa0“British Columbia’s colleges are working in collaboration with Indigenous leaders and students, governments, industry, communities and other partners to deliver on the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action for education and training,” Bell said. “Colleges\\xa0are implementing programs and services to support true and lasting reconciliation.”In every corner of the province, there are stories of student success made possible by studying at B.C.’s colleges. As part of this year’s BC Colleges Day celebrations, some of these successes have been captured in a handbook.

Urban has worked in health care for 35 years, 21 of them in long-term care in B.C. She has been in leadership roles with Interior Health for 14 years, most recently as director of long-term care. Urban also worked as a nurse in long-term care in both publicly owned and contracted provider care homes.Urban is also familiar with Summerland Seniors Village and was directly involved in recent quality reviews at the site.Summerland Seniors Village is a privately owned, long-term care home operated by West Coast Seniors Housing Management, which manages the Retirement Concepts group of companies.Summerland Seniors Village has 112 long-term care beds. Interior Health publicly funds 75 of the beds. Twelve beds are currently closed to admissions.West Coast Seniors Housing Management operates two other long-term care facilities in Interior Health – one in Kamloops and one in Williams Lake. Interior Health does not have similar quality or licensing concerns with these sites.In 2013, an administrator was appointed at Summerland Seniors Village for four months when the facility was under different ownership.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nA new Interim Business Property Tax Relief program will allow local governments to provide immediate property tax relief for the 2020 tax year.This relief will apply to small businesses and\\xa0non-profits, as well as arts and culture organizations, that are struggling with high lease costs as a result of years of rapidly increasing property values.“Years of an out-of-control real estate market have resulted in unexpected tax spikes for many small businesses that pay property taxes as part of their commercial leases,\" said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “People have been asking for help, and today we’re offering a way for local governments to provide that help. This new program empowers local governments to provide immediate relief to the small businesses and organizations most affected by skyrocketing property taxes in their communities.”Recognizing the challenges look different in each municipality, this tax relief program will allow municipalities to exempt, by bylaw, a portion of the assessed value of those properties most affected by this issue in a way that works for their community.The changes enable significant relief for small businesses and others who have been calling for changes for over a decade. It will reduce the taxes paid by these properties, reducing lease costs for tenants with triple-net leases. The legislation gives municipalities maximum flexibility to tailor the way they identify properties in need of relief in their communities and to set the amount of tax exemption for selected properties.To help communities meet the timeline to deliver relief for the 2020 tax year, ministry staff have worked with interested communities since advance notice of the legislation was given in January. The Province has worked with municipalities to help them prepare for implementation\\xa0and will further support them by providing a model bylaw, staff advice, a user guide and procedural changes.This program is an interim solution while the Province continues to work with local governments and the Union of British Columbia Municipalities, as well as business and community stakeholders on a permanent solution that will work for communities of all sizes throughout the province.This legislation, the municipal affairs and housing statutes amendments act, also introduced four other minor amendments to the Assessment Act, Local Government Act, Community Charter and the Vancouver Charter.Quotes: Michael Hind, CEO, Tri-Cities Chamber of Commerce –“We appreciate the provincial government\\'s efforts to address the large commercial-property tax increases threatening many small businesses around B.C., including in the Tri-Cities. The proposed interim measures are a step in the right direction, but we continue to stress the need for the provincial government to develop a comprehensive long-term solution.”Brian McBay, executive director, 221A\\xa0–“Vancouver is being emptied out of music and performing art venues, art galleries and artist studios.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Province has proposed a number of legislative changes that will help strengthen local governments’ ability to enforce bylaws and maintain housing, provide more financial transparency for BC Assessment and streamline administrative processes for local governments.If passed, this legislation will amend the following provincial statutes:Assessment Authority ActBC Assessment is the only provincial Crown corporation that operates on a calendar-based fiscal year. This proposed amendment will bring BC Assessment’s fiscal year in line with the provincial government and all other Crown corporations, making its financial information and reporting more transparent and easier to understand.Local Government Act and Vancouver CharterA proposed amendment to both the Local Government Act and the Vancouver Charter will respond to the request by the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) to repeal its authority to administer the commercial vehicle licensing program on behalf of participating municipalities. Originally, the revenue from administering this program was collected and used by local governments. The request from UBCM is based on its evaluation of the program that found it was no longer cost-effective and did not meet the needs of its participating local governments.Vancouver Charter and Community CharterAn amendment to the Vancouver Charter and Community Charter strengthens the City of Vancouver’s bylaw enforcement tools to address poorly maintained buildings. In particular, this addresses concerns with low-income housing, such as single-room occupancy housing. The amendment requires property owners to complete necessary remedial repairs and work within 30 days — a reduction from the earlier 60 days. With this change, if a property owner fails to complete the remedial work within 30 days, or sooner in urgent cases, the city can step in and complete the work at the property owner’s expense.The proposed amendment also raises the fine for serious bylaw contravention – which can be imposed daily – from $10,000 to $50,000 per offence, to help local governments provide a significant deterrent against serious bylaw infractions.Vancouver CharterThis proposed amendment helps streamline the land development process by giving the City of Vancouver the same authority to enter into latecomer agreements currently available to other local governments and land or property developers of multi-phase projects. The latecomer agreements help a local government to plan for growth in an area by building anticipated infrastructure such as roads, sewer, water and drainage that goes beyond needs for the initial approved plan by the first developer.As an area grows and future developers submit plans to the city, it can collect a latecomer charge from the future developers to use the services and pay a portion to the initial developer for paying the up-front cost of building the infrastructure. Currently, due to the lack of this authority, Vancouver requires the initial developer to enter into an agreement to provide these services, which is a more cumbersome process.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The number of deaths is down 36% from the year before.Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, has released the following statement:“Today’s release by the BC Coroners Service of the 2019 drug toxicity deaths is a sharp reminder of lives cut too short, and of devastated families and communities left behind in the wake of this collective tragedy. We mourn each and every person lost, not as a number but as a person whose life matters. No one should have to experience the pain of losing a loved one to the ongoing fentanyl-poisoning crisis.“While I am very encouraged to see the number of overdose deaths going down for the first time since this crisis began, and that fewer families will receive the terrible news of a loved one lost, our government is committed now more than ever to keep our foot firmly on the gas, to keep going and keep acting on what the evidence shows us is working.“We have scaled up more life-saving supports like naloxone and overdose prevention services and created more pathways for medication-assisted treatment and for recovery. Thanks to our partners at the BC Centre for Disease Control, we know these strategies have prevented thousands of deaths and are helping people become healthy again.“At the same time, we recognize that we still have an incredible amount of work to do. We know that more and more people are surviving overdose and living with long-term health impacts. We know that more people are seeking treatment and recovery and we are working tirelessly to meet those long-neglected needs.“We have more treatment beds coming online this year and tough new regulations in place so that people in recovery homes get better care. We are also working with health authorities to further expand access to medication-assisted treatment for people living with opioid-use disorder. And we are working in partnership with the First Nations Health Authority to build two new urban Indigenous\\xa0treatment centres and rebuilding six more in rural B.C.“I want to extend my deepest gratitude to first responders, peers, families, health-care professionals and community workers who are dealing with the deeply emotional toll of doing everything they can to save lives and connect people to care time and time again. Our province owes you a debt we can never repay.\\xa0“The way we act and speak can make a life-changing difference for someone who is living with addiction, to find a pathway to hope and to healing. We cannot afford to stop caring. It really will take all hands on deck to stem this terrible tide and reduce the stigma that leads to so many people using and dying alone.\\xa0“As we look to the year ahead, we will continue to work closely with and listen to the valuable advice of our partners, including people with lived experience to save lives and build a better, more connected continuum of care options for people living with addiction.”\\xa0A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Though the 981 illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2019 represent a 36% decrease from similar deaths in 2018, the number is virtually identical to the number of those who died in 2016, the year the provincial health emergency was declared.“More than 5,000 lives have been lost in B.C. since 2016 as a result of illicit drug toxicity. These deaths have deeply hurt families and communities across our province and represent an immense loss of potential in all walks of life,” said Lisa Lapointe, B.C.’s chief coroner. “The number of illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2019 remains higher than motor vehicle incidents, suicides and homicides combined, and B.C. continues to bear the heaviest toll of the impacts of the unpredictable, profit-driven, illicit drug market.“Collectively, we continue to urge for greater access to safe supply for those in our community who are experiencing, and struggling to live with, substance use disorder.”A continuing trend highlighted in the report is that middle-aged men are over-represented with more than three quarters of the suspected overdose deaths involving males and 71% involving people aged 30 to 59. Eighty-seven per cent of deaths continue to occur indoors, with more people dying on the days immediately following the issuance of income assistance payments than all other days in the year.“The decrease in the number of British Columbians dying from this crisis is encouraging and indicates that our harm-reduction measures to keep people alive are working,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. “We’re dealing with addiction. And addiction is an illness, a health condition. We are in no way out of this crisis yet. We continue to see very high rates of overdose events across the province and are seeing increased numbers of young people with long-lasting health effects after overdosing.“The measures we are taking to ensure access to services are there for people who use drugs when they are ready and able to start their path to recovery. And in the meantime, we need to change our approach so that people who use drugs are able to seek help without the fear of being charged criminally and with access to a pharmaceutical alternative, instead of what is clearly a toxic street-drug supply.”More than four in every five deaths in 2019 had fentanyl detected in post-mortem testing.\"The effectiveness of the overdose response must be acknowledged, and our gratitude for the tireless work of those who are responding to overdoses when they occur cannot be overstated,\" said Dr. Perry Kendall, co-interim executive director at the BC Centre on Substance Use. \"We must also acknowledge that overdoses are still occurring at an equal or greater rate than ever as a result of the toxic drug supply, posing a significant public health threat that will impact a generation of British Columbians. An overdose can lead to long-term harms, such as traumatic brain injury that will last a lifetime. Lives are being saved, but saving lives alone is not nearly enough. We must now turn our attention toward implementing strategies to prevent overdoses from occurring in the first place — which must start with a legally regulated drug supply.”\\xa0Despite a decrease\\xa0of illicit drug toxicity deaths over the past year, the number of non-fatal events plateaued in 2019, according to data from BC Emergency Health Services.“While we\\'re seeing a decrease in deaths, data from BC Emergency Health Services shows we were called to the same high level of overdoses in 2019,” said Lance Stephenson, director of patient care delivery with BC Emergency Health Services. “We are still getting called for more than 65 overdoses a day in B.C. We\\'re still in a crisis.”Aboriginal British Columbians continue to be over-represented in the data proportionally – and following further review by the First Nations Health Authority, an Aboriginal-focused report will be published with more detailed data and analysis.“We can confirm we will be releasing our own data in partnership with the BC Coroners Service on the specific impact of this crisis on First Nations people in B.C. in the coming weeks,” said Dr. Nel Wieman, senior medical officer, mental health and wellness with the First Nations Health Authority. “But we know one thing for certain: the impact of this crisis on Indigenous peoples is proportionately greater than for the rest of the population.”Quick Facts:\\nThe number of illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2019 equates to about 2.7 deaths per day for the year.\\nThere was at least one illicit drug toxicity death in 330 of the 365 days in 2019.\\nThe townships experiencing the highest number of illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2019 are Vancouver, Surrey, Victoria and Abbotsford.\\nVancouver Coastal Health Authority had the highest rate of illicit drug toxicity deaths (23 deaths per 100,000 individuals), followed by Northern Health Authority (22.5 deaths per 100,000 individuals) in 2019.\\nOverall, the rate in B.C. was 19 deaths per 100,000 individuals in 2019;\\n\\nBy local health area, the rates of illicit drug toxicity deaths were highest in Princeton, Grand Forks, Hope, Keremeos, and Merritt, from 2017 to 2019.\\nLearn More:For the latest report on Illicit Drug Overdose Deaths in B.C.

The person affected was in close contact with the previously reported sixth case announced on Feb. 20, 2020. Both cases remain in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.“The individual has been confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) testing. The individual is male, in his 40s and lives in the Fraser Health region.“The BCCDC is now officially authorized for COVID-19 testing by the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) and therefore samples no longer require\\xa0further confirmation by the NML in Winnipeg.“Fraser Health is actively investigating and close contacts have been identified and contacted by public health officials. Those who may be at risk are now in isolation for 14 days and are being actively monitored for symptoms daily.“Of these seven cases, the first case has recovered, as indicated by the resolution of symptoms, followed by two successive negative test results 24 hours apart. The other six B.C. patients with COVID-19 remain in self-isolation at home and under care by public-health teams. \\xa0“The risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia continues to remain low at this time. We are watching recent global developments very closely and will continue to adapt our response to developing evidence and ongoing assessment of COVID-19 should it be required. We will notify the public if the measures in B.C. change.“Given the changing dynamics of the outbreak in China and globally, and recognizing we are in the midst of influenza season, we\\xa0ask all travellers who are returning to B.C. — no matter where they were in the world\\xa0— to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms. If any symptoms arise, limit their contact with others and contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.“People who have recently travelled through the Hubei province of China or are returning from quarantined cruise ships are being contacted by public health officials and are self-isolating for 14 days upon arriving in B.C. after leaving the area of potential exposure.\"If people have travelled to mainland China in the past 14 days, they are advised to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, cough and breathing difficulties), and to contact their public health office if they have any concerns.“The most important measures people in B.C. can take to prevent respiratory illnesses including COVID-19 are cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you are sick.“Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, COVID-19 should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811. Translation services for 811 are\\xa0available in more than 130\\xa0languages.”Learn More:For more information and latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The new mine allowance under the Mineral Tax Act has been extended for five years, to the end of 2025.“Mining is a foundational industry in B.C. that supports communities and creates good jobs for people throughout the province,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “Building on the work of the Mining Jobs Task Force, we are taking action to attract new investment, drive innovation in the sector\\xa0and ensure British Columbia remains a world-class mining jurisdiction.”Budget 2020 will also make it easier for industry to invest in clean, low-carbon technologies. Businesses in the mining and resource industries can now obtain machinery and equipment for pollution control and waste management without paying provincial sales tax, regardless of where it will be used. Previously, this exemption was subject to geographic constraints.“B.C.’s mining industry is a world-leading provider of responsibly produced, low-carbon metals and minerals that are essential for a cleaner future and create economic and social benefits for all British Columbians,” said Michael Goehring, president and CEO of the Mining Association of British Columbia. “Our message to government and the public on Mining Day is simple: improving British Columbia’s ability to compete and succeed in global markets will lead to more economic opportunities and high-wage jobs in B.C., more opportunities to advance economic reconciliation with Indigenous communities\\xa0and more government tax revenues to support the public services we all value.”The Province’s tax incentives for mineral exploration, focus on permitting efficiency and global reputation for environmental responsibility make B.C. an attractive place for investment. The Province has seen significant investments in mining operations over the past two years.In his recent mandate letter from the Premier, Ralston was tasked with taking further action to strengthen the mining sector. He was directed to prioritize work on regulatory efficiency initiatives, with a focus on expedited permitting processes and reconciliation in the mining sector. Ralston was also mandated to further connect the technology and innovation sector with industries, such as mining, and to showcase made-in-B.C. technologies that are contributing to industrial competitiveness or helping to reduce emissions.Quick Facts:\\nMining and related sectors in B.C. provide jobs for more than 30,000 people throughout the province and have a production value of more than $9 billion.\\nIn 2018-19, the B.C. mining industry paid over $400 million in mineral taxes to the Province.\\nOver 3,700 B.C. suppliers around the province provide $2.9 billion worth of goods and services to B.C. mining operations.\\nThe mining sector in B.C. pays an average annual salary of $117,000; higher than forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction.\\nLearn More:The Mining Jobs Task Force report and recommendations are available online: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/business/natural-resource-industries/mineral-exploration-and-mining/memp_10535_task_force_report_final-rev.pdfRalston’s mandate letter is available here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/ministries-organizations/premier-cabinet-mlas/minister-letter/ralston-mandate-2020.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nLocal and regional governments in 18 communities have been approved to receive their share of more than $12 million in provincial emergency preparedness funding to support structural flood mitigation projects.The intent is to support eligible applicants to prevent, eliminate or reduce hazards through structural flood mitigation projects.Since the September 2017 Budget Update, communities and governments throughout B.C. have received more than $40 million through the Community Emergency Preparedness Fund (CEPF). The successful applicants for the latest round of funding are in every corner of the province.“In order to reduce the risk to British Columbians from hazards like flooding, we’re investing in mitigation projects,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “We know that to improve public safety and create resilience among people and families, it’s critical to plan ahead with the aim of preventing disasters where possible and lessening the impact they have on our communities.”Funding for the structural flood project component of CEPF was announced at the September 2017 convention of the Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM). This funding is part of a nearly $69.5-million plan designed to help communities prepare for, and respond to, disasters.“We’re proud to invest in disaster mitigation and improved resilience for British Columbians across the province,” said Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness. “This funding will help keep communities safer and improve outcomes in the event of an emergency situation.” \\xa0The CEPF is a suite of programs designed to enhance the resiliency of local governments, First Nations’ communities and their residents. The Province provides the funding, which is administered by UBCM, and is divided into seven streams:\\nflood risk assessment, flood mapping and flood mitigation planning\\nemergency support services\\nemergency operations centres and training\\nstructural flood mitigation\\nevacuation routes\\nvolunteer and composite fire departments equipment and training\\nIndigenous cultural safety and cultural humility training\\nIn May 2019, the Province announced the above-mentioned new, sixth stream of CEPF funding for volunteer and composite fire departments. Proponents, including First Nations communities, local governments and society-run departments, were able to apply for their share of $5 million to go toward equipment and training.The Province created a seventh stream with $1 million for Indigenous cultural safety and cultural humility training. This brings the CEPF total to $69.5 million and opens eligibility to all First Nations’ communities.The next deadlines for applications are:\\nMarch 13, 2020, for emergency operations centres and training\\nApril 17, 2020, for evacuation route planning\\nA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nBailey Farm is celebrating 100 years of farming history at the Nechako Valley Regional Cattlemens Association’s Annual General Meeting this year.The farm’s history begins with James Bailey’s arrival to British Columbia aboard the ship Ascania in 1914. From the coast, Bailey travelled to the Nechako Valley, where he had family already settled. Bailey enlisted to serve in the First World War and in 1916, he fought in France for three years as part of the 102nd Canadian Expeditionary Force Battalion.“James’ journey, his service and his dedication to building a home and a farm for his family are\\xa0an inspiration to many,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Congratulations to the Bailey family on 100 years of contributing to B.C.’s farming, ranching and community history with best wishes for the years to come.”In 1919, Bailey received a land grant through the Veterans Land Act and built a tiny, two-roomed log house. Thirteen years later, in 1932, Bailey married Elizabeth Redmond. They raised three sons and expanded\\xa0the family home to accommodate their growing family.The farm began with dairy cows, laying hens, beef cattle and horses. Beef cattle were raised for both food and income, while horses were bred to sell to other farmers and used to help with work around the farm. Milk, cream and eggs were sold locally to businesses in the community.“Life hasn’t always been easy, but we are very lucky folks who are blessed with a large family and a beautiful farm,” said Myrna Bailey. “We have five children, nine grandchildren and 16 great grandchildren who have all played a role in keeping up the family farm.”The Bailey family continues to raise beef and has expanded the farm to grow grain and hay. \\xa0Century Farm Awards honour agricultural organizations that have been active for a century or longer, as well as pioneers whose farms and ranches have been in families for 100 years or more.

       "  '\\n\\nTwenty B.C. farmers and food processors are receiving support from the federal and provincial governments to upgrade equipment that tracks animal and product movement.Traceability plays a significant role in protecting animal health, public health and food safety, and improves emergency planning and response.The equipment upgrades include software and e-tools that monitor, trace and automatically update databases to track when animals or products arrive and depart farms, or transit to processing and distribution centres.The 20 farms and businesses receiving funding produce, process and handle foods such as bell peppers, grapes, cherries, organic greens, pork, sheep, seafood, egg and meat products, as well as salad dressings, fruit juice, crepes, breads and pastries. These companies operate on the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, and in the Thompson-Okanagan and Kootenays.The new equipment will track individual animals or food products on their journey along the supply chain, from farm to table. If a problem occurs and product recalls are needed, this information can help limit economic, social and environmental impacts, protect brand reputation and maintain market access for businesses and the sector.Funding for these projects was provided through a new $313,500 allocation to traceability programs in November 2019. This increase brings the total program funding in B.C. to about $1.75 million since January 2018.The traceability programs were oversubscribed in 2019, and the new funding ensures that all B.C. farmers and ranchers whose applications met the requirements in previous intake periods will receive support. The next round of applications for the new funding is now\\xa0open.Traceability programs are supported by the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, which is a federal-provincial-territorial initiative to strengthen the agriculture, agrifood and agri-based product sector.Quotes: Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food –“The Government of Canada is pleased to see so many farmers and food processors take advantage of the funding available to improve their traceability systems. Support through this program helps to further strengthen food safety from farm to table, and maintain trust and confidence in Canadian food products, both at home and abroad.”\\xa0\\xa0Lana Popham, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture –“When emergencies happen on the farm, the effects can be devastating for both farmers and consumers.

       "  '\\n\\nAfter years of respectful dialogue, the B.C government has partnered with the Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations and the federal government to achieve a historic agreement that strives to protect southern mountain caribou in northeastern\\xa0B.C., while considering the social and economic well-being of communities and stakeholders in the region.“From the beginning, our government committed to protecting this iconic species,” said Doug Donaldson, B.C.’s Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “There’s no question that we’ve had to overcome some challenges along the way, but I am proud of how the parties persevered to find solutions. This agreement\\xa0is a significant step forward.”Dozens of First Nations representatives and stakeholders gathered in Vancouver on Feb. 21, 2020, to celebrate the signing of the amended partnership agreement by the provincial government, the federal government, the West Moberly First Nations and the Saulteau First Nation.In recent weeks, the West Moberly First Nations\\xa0and Saulteau First Nation\\xa0offered amendments to the partnership agreement that provide more opportunities for local government involvement in caribou recovery work.The number of caribou in British Columbia has dropped over the last century from about 40,000 animals to about 15,000. Southern mountain caribou populations now total fewer than 3,100. The population of the central group of southern mountain caribou is about 230.The partnership agreement reflects a collaborative approach to caribou conservation, which:\\ncomplements the leadership role that the Saulteau First Nation and West Moberly First Nations have already taken on caribou recovery efforts in the Peace region;\\nincludes a commitment to protect over 700,000 hectares of important caribou habitat in northeastern B.C.;\\nbuilds on the work that the parties have already undertaken in habitat restoration, maternal penning projects and predator management. Through these efforts, the decline of the central group has been reversed. The population is now growing at an average rate of 15% per year; and\\ntakes into account the social and economic well-being of communities and stakeholders in the region.\\nDonaldson signed the agreement with:\\nJonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change;\\nChief Ken Cameron of the Saulteau First Nation;\\nChief Roland Willson of the West Moberly First Nations;\\nGeorge Heyman, B.C.’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy; and\\nBruce Ralston, B.C.’s Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources.\\nHabitat disturbance, predation, climate change and human activities on the landscape have led to declines in caribou populations in recent decades. The B.C. government has been taking concrete steps to address those concerns and develop a comprehensive, made-in-B.C. approach to managing the species.Part of that approach is the Provincial Caribou Recovery Program. It ensures that Indigenous Nations, local governments, stakeholders and the natural resource sector can participate in the planning and implementation of caribou recovery measures. Ongoing engagement with stakeholders has helped guide recovery efforts for the central group, including a Leaders’ Table meeting held in November 2019 and a series of stakeholder committee meetings that were initiated in January 2020.The\\xa0partnership agreement includes new language that clarifies B.C.’s commitment to involving local governments in caribou recovery. Collaboration with local governments and tenure holders will continue to support the effective implementation of the partnership agreement.The partnership agreement also reconfirms the 2,689-hectare Klin-se-za Provincial Park (pronounced \"Klin-see’-za\") will be expanded by about 30,800 hectares. The Province previously committed to a park expansion (Area B2) in 2015, as part of the Saulteau First Nation-British Columbia New Relationship and Reconciliation Agreement. The enlarged park will cover over 34,300 hectares and incorporate two mountains known locally as The Twin Sisters. The Twin Sisters area is considered to be a sacred place by Indigenous peoples in the region and elsewhere, and supports caribou recovery.The B.C. government will continue to work with the federal government, First Nations, local governments and communities on these initiatives, in accordance with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act. The Province also acknowledges the desire of local residents, industry and other stakeholders to pursue their economic goals and participate in other activities on the land base.Quotes:Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change —“The conservation agreements announced today represent bold action to support the survival and recovery of the iconic southern mountain caribou in British Columbia. It has taken a lot of hard work to get us here today.\\xa0I wish to thank and recognize the leadership of Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations for their continued advocacy and leadership in this agreement. I would also like to thank the Government of British Columbia for its partnership. Today’s agreements are an important step to ensuring that our kids and grandkids can continue to enjoy this species now and into the future.”Chief Ken Cameron, Saulteau First Nation\\xa0—“This is a powerful moment in history, and it’s a turning point for B.C. and Canada and First Nations. People working together to save a species from extinction – it’s real and we can do this – our new partnership agreement confirms it. I want to invite all people to join with us, support us and help make it happen for the future generations to come. Many years ago, our ancestors were given a prophecy from the Creator. The prophecy says that we will find sanctuary at the Twin Sisters mountains. Our people have always kept faith with the prophecy, we know it to be true. It is so fitting that by protecting the Twin Sisters area here today, we can now also give sanctuary to our endangered caribou in the future.”Chief Roland Willson, West Moberly First Nations —“For thousands of years, the caribou have given us food, clothes and tools to survive harsh winters. They are not just animals to us. They are our brothers and sisters, our friends and our ancestors. The caribou have been suffering for decades as their habitat is destroyed piece by piece. They need us now — all of us. This partnership agreement gives us hope. It means that help is on the way. To my fellow elected representatives of the Peace region, I thank each of you that worked productively with us at the Leaders’ Table and during engagement on this agreement over the last year. Now, the real work begins. Several doors have been opened for you to participate. We look forward to this collaboration and to joint efforts dispelling myths, combating racism and promoting a region rich in wildlife, culture and sustainable economic activity.”George Heyman, B.C.’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy —“Protecting and promoting at-risk species requires everyone to collaborate in order to do the important work of restoring habitat and piloting new ways to support a return to healthy numbers. We committed several months ago to completing this partnership agreement while also ensuring respectful engagement with local governments. The Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations have demonstrated leadership by putting in practice new ways to address the decline in the caribou population in the South Peace.”Bruce Ralston, B.C.’s Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources —“Collaboration has been at the heart of this partnership agreement. It’s a perfect example of how government can work with its partners to consider both economic and environmental interests while balancing community needs with caribou recovery.”Quick Facts:\\nThe decline of caribou populations in British Columbia is a complex problem that requires a thoughtful, inclusive process to stabilize populations and build a broadly supported Caribou recovery program.\\nThrough the Provincial Caribou Recovery Program, the B.C. government has committed $47 million over five years to support caribou recovery, using a comprehensive, science-based approach.\\nThese initiatives include herd planning (a collaborative approach involving Indigenous Nations, industry, stakeholders and governments), habitat management, protection and restoration, maternity penning programs, a supplemental feeding program, animal relocations, predator management and other measures.\\n\\nThe B.C. government has also provided $8.5 million to the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund to implement caribou habitat restoration programs.\\nLearn More:To read an open\\xa0letter from Chief Ken Cameron to Premier John Horgan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Saulteau_letter.pdfA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nGovernment\\xa0has introduced a new arbitration act to modernize the province’s domestic arbitration system and improve how British Columbians can quickly and finally resolve their disputes outside court.“Arbitration is a valuable way for people to resolve disputes in private by agreeing to be bound by the decision of an independent and impartial arbitrator,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “The current legislation reflects practices dating back to the 19th century and hasn’t been significantly changed since the 1980s. This new act reflects current best practices for fair, efficient and final resolution options for British Columbians.”\\xa0Key changes include new provisions about:\\nhow arbitration proceedings can be started;\\nclarification around the duties of the arbitrators, parties and expert witnesses;\\nsimpler and faster appeals; and\\nimproved confidentiality.\\nThe proposed new legislation builds on recommended changes from the Uniform Law Conference of Canada’s Uniform Arbitration Act and will better align with similar B.C. arbitration legislation that covers disputes of an international nature.\\xa0\\xa0The\\xa0British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre (soon to be known as the Vancouver International Arbitration Centre) maintains a unique and prominent position in the arbitration act as the “designated appointing authority.” It will be authorized to quickly appoint an arbitrator when the parties are unable to agree, and resolve fee disputes between parties and arbitrators.The changes will also move family arbitration provisions from the Arbitration Act to the Family Law Act, which already deals with various aspects of family disputes and encourages out-of-court resolution of matters in the best interests of families and children.\\xa0Quick Facts:\\nB.C. has two arbitration statutes: a\\xa0domestic act (the Arbitration Act) and an international act (the International Commercial Arbitration Act).\\xa0Arbitration is international if the parties are based in different jurisdictions.\\nThe guiding principles of B.C.’s arbitration statutes are based on the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL Model Law), which says arbitration should be fair to both parties, arbitrators should be neutral and unbiased, and parties to an agreement should be held to their bargain.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Forestry Alliance Save the Working Forest rally on Feb. 18, 2020, at the Parliament Buildings:“I spoke with members of the B.C. Forestry Alliance today because I wanted to hear about their concerns. I told them that our government will support the thousands of people who rely on the forest sector for their jobs and livelihoods.“We will continue to work with the sector to address challenges and ensure a bright and sustainable future. This includes our hard work on our Coast Forest Sector Revitalization plan to make sure more logs are processed in our province and reducing wood waste by redirecting it to our pulp and paper mills.“On the Coast, we’ve committed $5 million in bridging loans to help contractors impacted by the labour dispute make payments for their logging equipment. This is after we provided $69 million to assist workers impacted by the downturn in the Interior.“We know there is a greater need, which is why we have been pressing the federal government to bring resources to the table, as they did during the 2008 downturn. I spoke with Seamus O’Regan, federal Minister of Natural Resources, last week and let him know that British Columbians believe that worker support is a shared responsibility.“The B.C. Forestry Alliance and others have made it clear to us that they are concerned about how old-growth forests are managed. That’s why we commissioned an independent, two-person panel to hear people’s perspectives on the economic, ecological and cultural importance of old-growth trees and forests. We expect to hear back from the panel later this spring.“Our government is dedicated to putting people first when it comes to how we manage our forests. That’s why we’ve made changes to ensure proper oversight to tenure agreement transfers. This is good for workers, communities and companies, large and small.“I appreciate the input I received today from members of the B.C.

       "  '\\n\\nBudget 2020 moves British Columbia forward by building the infrastructure the growing province needs, supporting thousands of new jobs, strengthening investments in health and education and making life more affordable for everyone.“From new roads, hospitals, housing, schools and child care centres to better, more affordable services in every community, we’re seeing fundamental changes that are making life better for British Columbians,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “Together, we’ve made a lot of progress and we can’t turn back. Budget 2020 keeps our province moving forward by focusing on people.”Building a stronger B.C.Budget 2020 makes new commitments to bring capital spending over three years to $22.9 billion – the highest level in B.C.’s history. Work is underway on new and upgraded hospitals and health facilities, highway and transit projects, schools and new housing throughout B.C. that is stimulating more than 100,000 direct and indirect jobs during construction.“British Columbians are working hard to build a better future for their family, and so are we. By building the infrastructure our growing province needs, we’re making life easier for people and creating good jobs and opportunities in local communities,” James said.A stronger B.C. means ensuring there are opportunities for everyone. Budget 2020 takes another step forward toward reconciliation with Indigenous peoples by affirming the historic 25-year revenue-sharing agreement that will see $3 billion of gaming revenues shared with all First Nations.New opportunities in a sustainable economyOver the next decade, more than 860,000 jobs will open up throughout British Columbia. More than 75% of all jobs will require some post-secondary education or training.Budget 2020 creates a new, needs-based BC Access Grant for students to make sure all British Columbians can tap into these opportunities, while growing B.C.’s skilled workforce. This grant will provide up to $4,000 to help with the up-front costs of tuition for more than 40,000 low- and middle-income students.“B.C.’s future is bright and filled with opportunity. With the new BC Access Grant, we’ll put a college or university education within reach for thousands more British Columbians,” James said. “These grants will make a difference for students, and they’ll help B.C. businesses find the skilled people they need.”The Province continues to support struggling forestry workers through access to job placement, skills training, equipment loans, grants for hard-hit communities and programs to support early retirement. Budget 2020 adds $13 million for new forestry revitalization efforts, including revving up B.C.’s bio-economy with innovations that convert wood into value-added products like biofuels, bioplastics and textiles.A clean environment is the foundation of a prosperous and sustainable economy. Budget 2020 accelerates the transition to a cleaner future with an additional $419 million over three years for CleanBC, on top of the approximately $900 million invested in Budget 2019. This funding includes incentives to buy electric vehicles (EV) and build EV charging stations. Additionally, this year’s budget increases support for industries moving toward clean, low-carbon solutions and projects to make B.C.’s schools, universities, colleges and hospitals more energy efficient.Making life more affordable and improving servicesB.C. is one of Canada’s fastest growing economies. But while the economy has grown, life has become too expensive for many families.The new BC Child Opportunity Benefit, launching in October 2020, will provide 290,000 families with more money to support their kids. Combined with B.C.’s Affordable Child Care Benefit and the Fee Reduction Initiative for licensed child care spaces, families with one child may save up to $20,000. Families with two children could save up to $28,000 each year.These savings come on the heels of a transformation at ICBC that will reduce fees by an average of 20%, or $400 a year for all drivers, while improving care benefits. It also marks the first full year of the elimination of medical services plan (MSP) premiums — the biggest middle-class tax cut in a generation.Budget 2020 strengthens the health, education and community services that all British Columbians depend on. The budget delivers an additional $339 million to strengthen B.C.’s K-12 education system — building on recent investments to upgrade schools and hire more than 4,200 new teachers.An additional $1 billion in Budget 2020 will improve health care in British Columbia. New or upgraded hospitals are on the way for 13 communities, and 12 new urgent and primary care centres are open. Two more are coming.A balanced planBudget 2020 is a balanced plan focused on the priorities of British Columbians.Budget 2020 creates a new tax bracket for the top 1% of income earners in British Columbia. Nearly half the revenue generated will come from individuals who make more than $1 million annually.“Today, we’re asking the people at the top, the highest 1% of individual income earners, to pay a little more and help B.C. provide families and communities with better services and stronger infrastructure,” James said.To help address the growing health costs and impacts of sweetened drinks, B.C. will begin charging provincial sales tax (PST) on sweetened carbonated beverages. This is a step that has been advocated for by health professionals and an all-party committee, as young people between the ages of 14 and 18 are the top consumers of pop.The Confidence and Supply Agreement with the BC Green Party caucus continues to provide the basis for a strong, stable government for British Columbia. By working together, progress continues to be made on shared priorities, like climate change, tackling the housing crisis and building a strong, diverse economy.Quick Facts:\\nThe budget is balanced in all three years of the fiscal plan with surpluses of $227 million in 2020-21, $179 million in 2021-22, and $374 million in 2022-23.\\nLast year, B.C.’s economy was among the top of the provincial real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rankings, led the country with the lowest unemployment rate, and was among the leaders in employment growth across Canada.\\nBritish Columbia is projected to continue to be among the top of the provincial real GDP growth rankings in 2020 and 2021.\\nBetween 2001 and 2019, B.C.’s population grew by nearly one million people, with much of the increase concentrated in the Lower Mainland. By 2024, B.C.’s population is expected to grow by approximately 346,000 people and by more than one million people in the next 15 years.\\nFour backgrounders follow.For a Punjabi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Budget-2020_Punjabi.pdfFor a French\\xa0translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020FIN0008-000290_French.pdfFor a Korean translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020FIN0008-000290_Korean.pdfFor a Farsi translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020FIN0008-000290_Farsi.pdfFor a Simplified Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020FIN0008-000290_Simplified_Chinese.pdfFor a Traditional Chinese translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020FIN0008-000290_Traditional_Chinese.pdfFor a Tagalog translation, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020FIN0008-000290_Tagalog.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nA fourth year of helicopter logging in the Williams Lake area is expected to start next week to help minimize the spread of Douglas fir beetles on Crown land.\\xa0These native forest pests normally attack small groups of trees, and a significant infestation can weaken and eventually kill a tree over a period of about one year. However, helicopter logging that selectively removes infested trees and protects other trees nearby, and related containment treatments, have helped to slow the spread of the beetles in the Williams Lake area over the past three years.These logging activities are being conducted under the direction of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. Monitoring of Douglas fir beetle infestations in previously treated areas has identified fewer trees currently under attack, so the helicopter-logging project has been expanded to new sites around Williams Lake.Helicopter-logging flights are expected to begin as early as Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2020, in the Chimney Valley area southwest of Williams Lake. Once work at that site is completed, operations will move to the Anderson Road area and then to sites on Fox Mountain. Heli-logging activities should be completed by mid-March 2020.Residents can expect to see helicopters in the air as selective logging operations get underway, but no flights will occur over residential buildings. The aircraft will be flying only during daylight hours.Owners of livestock and pets are advised to take precautions to protect their animals from injuring themselves. Horses in particular can be sensitive to helicopter noise and may run if startled.For safety reasons, members of the public should stay away from active harvesting areas. They are also reminded that unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) must not be operated anywhere near the harvesting areas, since doing so can endanger the safety of pilots and workers on the ground.In addition to the direct harvesting of infested trees, the Williams Lake Beetle Management Unit 2020 Treatment Plan includes the following activities:\\nThe anti-aggregative pheromone methyl cyclo hexenone (MCH) will be used to prevent or disrupt Douglas fir beetle attacks on small infestation sites. This naturally occurring pheromone can successfully repel the beetles from vulnerable areas and also help protect small stands of trees near parks, protected areas, campgrounds, residential properties or old-growth management areas. In some cases, the application of this pheromone has reduced Douglas fir beetle attacks by over 90%.\\n“Trap trees” will be established by cutting down large, healthy Douglas fir trees in accessible areas. The trees will be left on the ground to attract adult beetles in the spring. Trap trees are more successful in attracting adult beetles than standing trees and therefore can greatly reduce the number of attacks on healthy Douglas fir trees nearby. Once adult beetles and larvae are established within a trap tree, it will be taken to a mill where the beetles and larvae will be destroyed in the milling process.\\nWhere appropriate, and if no other practical options are available, some infested trees may be cut down and burned on site to destroy beetles that are in the bark.\\nFunnel traps will also be deployed within mill yards and log storage areas to capture adult beetles.\\nThe Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development is committed to addressing the spread of Douglas fir beetles in the Cariboo-Chilcotin Natural Regional District and mitigating impacts on the mid-term timber supply, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities and wildfire management.Quick Facts:\\nThe Williams Lake Timber Supply Area (TSA) contains 3.24 million hectares of forest, with 1.83 million hectares considered to be available for timber harvesting.\\nDouglas fir beetle infestations tend to be cyclical. The last major outbreak in the Cariboo-Chilcotin Natural Regional District, prior to the current outbreak, peaked in 2008, covering about 68,550 hectares. The volume of timber killed by the Douglas fir beetle in the Williams Lake TSA that year was about 172,534 cubic metres.\\nThe shallow tunnels etched into the underside of the bark of an infested tree, called “galleries,” are created by the beetle adults and larvae as they feed on the wood.\\nWhen Douglas fir beetles attack, the needles of affected trees change colour in stages. The rate of colour change is highly variable, but a pale green or yellow colour indicates that the tree has been attacked recently. Bright red needles generally indicate that the tree was attacked the previous year. Brown trees with sparse foliage generally indicate that the trees have been dead for two or three years. A grey tree has lost all its needles, and this colour usually indicates that the tree has been dead for more than two years.\\nAccording to the ministry’s latest mapping data (based on aerial surveys conducted in the summer of 2019), Douglas fir beetles affected 52,791 hectares within the Cariboo-Chilcotin Natural Resource District in 2019. About 50,254 hectares were affected in the same region in 2018, with 46,231 hectares affected in 2017.\\nLearn More:Read more about Douglas fir beetle management or read a guide for managing the beetles on private property online:\\n\\xa0http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/forest-health/forest-pests/bark-beetles/douglas-fir-beetle/management\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nSince she was young, Breland Athies always felt disconnected from her Métis culture.Growing up in a Christian household, she says there was a lot of intergenerational trauma passed down from her family, which surfaced as mental health and addiction\\xa0challenges.She remembered hearing her friends talk about their family crests and realized she didn’t know where she came from. Athies says as she grew up, she struggled with anxiety and depression in high school and university, in part because she didn’t know much about her background.For Athies, now 27, her anxiety was hard to talk about. “If you have a diagnosis of something, you’re seen as ‘crazy.’ I was lucky, I had groups to go to and talk about these things. It’s a way to normalize those feelings and acknowledge it’s a shared experience for teens and humans in general. That made me feel better — growing up and realizing (anxiety) is a human experience.”Since then, Athies has reconnected to her Métis culture, which has provided her an immense sense of belonging and helped reduce her anxiety.Learning to cope with anxiety is a strategy she hoped to pass along to others as a program facilitator with the YMCA’s Teen Mind Medicine program. The Teen Mind Medicine pilot project, with $300,000 in funding from the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, supports Indigenous teens ages 13 to 19 who are experiencing stress, worry and mild to moderate anxiety.As part of the program, trained community members such as Athies teach teens strategies and practical tools to cope with anxiety and provide a safe space for young people to connect with one another and share experiences.The YMCA worked in partnership with 13 Indigenous community partners to deliver the Teen Mind Medicine program to roughly 100 teens around the province in fall 2019.Athies helped facilitate the program in Trail, in partnership with the Circle of Indigenous Nations Society, which brought together teens from two local high schools once a week. Not only did the program teach students strategies to cope with anxiety, it included a cultural component.Each session started with a blessing and smudge from an Elder, drumming a traditional song and a check in with a talking stick to see how everyone was feeling that day. Common themes that emerged were the impacts of colonization, the disconnect many teens felt from their culture and how it impacted their anxiety.Athies says after talking about their issues, she saw a difference in the 15 participants. Students were nervous in the beginning. They were unsure of what to expect, but by the end of the six-week program, many were grateful to learn how to put a name to their emotions and reconnect to their Indigenous cultures.“Anxiety is such a big issue for teens these days, especially in the age of technology where everyone is looking at their screens,” Athies says. “This was a good chance to increase socialization and notice that anxiety is normal. It was really important for those kids to take time out of their day to check in with their emotions in a group so that they’re not holding it in.”Learn More: For more information about programs offered at the YMCA to deal with anxiety, visit:\\xa0https://gv.ymca.ca/Programs/Health-Management/Teen-Mindfulness-Group\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nPeople living and working in long-term care homes throughout B.C. are benefiting from a $6.9-million grant to purchase new equipment that will help improve the safety and quality of life of residents.“Dignity, comfort, and security are what people and their loved ones expect and deserve when they are in long-term care,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Government is investing in these long-term care homes by adding new and replacement items, like beds and mattresses, and ceiling lifts and sensory rooms, so people can feel comfortable in their surroundings and enjoy their home-like setting.”The Seniors Safety and Quality Improvement Program (SSQIP) is a three-year program that is managed by the BC Care Providers Association (BCCPA). BCCPA has provided funding to long-term care home operators for the purchase of new equipment.A total of $10 million was provided over three years to 186 long-term care homes to buy over 8,000 new items: beds and mattresses, shower chairs and tubs, mobility equipment – such as floor and ceiling lifts –\\xa0lighting and visual aids, sensory rooms, music therapy and ergonomic furniture. The furniture includes specialized chairs and tables.An advisory group, which included representatives from the provincial government, BCCPA, Denominational Health Association and SafeCare BC, received applications and oversees funding allocation. Those approved received up to $500 per publicly funded bed to purchase equipment that enhances the safety and quality of life of seniors.“Our government is committed to improving care for seniors,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors. “The new equipment has helped ensure that their care is provided safely — for the people who live in long-term care, the families who visit them and the staff who care for them.”Daniel Fontaine, CEO of BCCPA, said, “We’re pleased to continue working with the Ministry of Health and other partners through this final round of SSQIP funding. The investments are aimed at creating more supportive environments for residents in long-term care and reducing injury rates among the workers who care for them.”Long-term care provides 24-hour professional care and supervision in a protective, supportive environment for people with complex care needs, who can no longer be cared for in their own homes or in an assisted-living residence.Government is investing more than $1 billion over three years to improve care for seniors, including investments in primary care, home health, long-term care, assisted living and respite services.The Province is also providing $240 million over three years to increase staffing levels in long-term care homes, with the goal of achieving the target 3.36 direct care hours per resident day – on average – across all health authorities by the end of 2020-21. In 2018-19, these added more than one million direct hours of care for seniors in long-term care homes throughout the province.Learn More:For more information on the Seniors Safety and Quality Improvement Program, visit: http://bccare.ca/programs/ssqip/Long-term care homes receiving funding: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/backgrounder_long_term_care_homes_funding.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The B.C. government will continue to identify and prioritize solutions to support these growing communities moving forward.South Island Transportation StrategyA study to determine long-term solutions for getting people moving more efficiently throughout south Vancouver Island is underway.The\\xa0South Island Transportation Strategy will look to identify improvement options for transit, cycling, pedestrian movements, ferry services, rail and existing roads and the connections between them. The study area will go as far north as the Duncan area and as far west as the Sooke area. It will look at current transportation demands and develop a roadmap for future investments across all modes of travel.\\xa0The study will be completed in spring 2020 and will identify specific transportation investment opportunities in the South Island region.Priority bus lanesPriority bus lanes along the Trans-Canada Highway are an efficient solution to gridlock in the CRD, which is why the Province has committed to accelerating work in this area. The Douglas Street/Highway 1 corridor currently supports as many as 1,700 vehicles per hour during peak travel times. At the same time, BC Transit transports 40% of people travelling this route during peak hours, while only making up 3% of the traffic. The ministry’s goal is to keep increasing the number of people who choose transit to help cut the congestion.Bus lane projects:\\nSouthbound Burnside Bridge to Tolmie Avenue – completion in spring 2020\\xa0(Province of B.C.)\\nMcKenzie Interchange (includes bus lanes) – completion in summer 2020 (Province of B.C.)\\nNorthbound Tolmie Avenue to Burnside Bridge – completed in 2018 (Province of B.C.)\\nSouthbound Tolmie Avenue to Hillside Avenue – completed in 2018 (City of Victoria)\\nNorthbound Fisgard Street to Tolmie Avenue – completed in 2015 (City of Victoria)\\nSouthbound Hillside Avenue to Fisgard Street – completed in 2014 (City of Victoria)\\nMalahatThe ministry wrapped up the $34-million Malahat Village Safety Improvement project in the fall of 2018, which included expanding five kilometres to four lanes, installing three kilometres of median barrier and improving highway access through a frontage road system. 65% of the highway is now protected with a median barrier, with more safety upgrades being explored.Work is underway to widen Highway 1 to four lanes between Leigh Road and the Westshore Parkway. This $14-million project will improve safety at the southern gateway to the Malahat.McKenzie InterchangeThe $96-million McKenzie Interchange is being built to reduce congestion and improve safety for drivers, transit users, pedestrians and cyclists along one of the busiest corridors in B.C. Fixing this bottleneck area along Highway 1 will save drivers an estimated 20 minutes in each direction, allowing families to spend more time together and less time stuck in traffic.In addition to a new interchange, the project includes bus priority lanes in both directions, new fully accessible, well-lit bus stops, improved pedestrian connections and widening of the Galloping Goose Trail with an overpass over McKenzie and a new bridge for pedestrians and cyclists over the highway.The traffic lights on Highway 1 were removed in December 2019 to allow\\xa0traffic to flow freely on the highway. The entire project, including the loop ramp, landscaping and transit facilities, is expected to be completed by summer 2020.Highway 17/Keating Cross Road FlyoverThe project involves a new “flyover” overpass from the Pat Bay Highway (Highway 17) northbound to Keating Cross Road westbound, eliminating the left turn across highway traffic onto Keating Cross Road. The project will also include a realigned southbound on-ramp to Victoria.The initial project estimate is $44.3 million, with contributions from the Government of Canada, Province of B.C. and District of Central Saanich.Highway 14In January 2018, the B.C. government announced major upgrades to the Highway 14 corridor to improve safety and reduce congestion. The $10-million investment includes three new bus pull-outs on both sides of Highway 14 at the West Shore Parkway, Laidlaw Road and Harbourview Road, a slow-moving vehicle pullout east of Muir Creek, a new two-lane bridge on Gillespie Road (which is an important alternative route to Highway 14) and a new rest area at the Sombrio lookout.A new bus-queue jump lane at Jacklin Road and safety upgrades to the Sooke River Road intersection were completed in June 2019.In April 2019, the B.C. government announced the widening and realignment of approximately 1.5 kilometres of Highway 14 between Glinz Lake Road and Connie Road, a new park and ride on Gillespie Road, and shoulder widening between Otter Point Road and Woodhaven Road. Public consultation took place in late 2019/early 2020, with construction to begin in summer 2020.Island Rail (formerly E&N Rail) CorridorIn December 2018, the ministry led a historic roundtable meeting, bringing together the Premier, First Nations, local decision makers and the Island Corridor Foundation to openly discuss the future of the Island Rail corridor.\\xa0This discussion marked a progressive step forward in ensuring that major stakeholders along the corridor have their voices heard.The ministry is currently completing a condition assessment to evaluation the condition of the Island Rail Corridor, as well as the costs to bring the corridor up to current standards.In addition, through its work on the South Island Transportation Strategy, the Province continues to evaluate options for the Island Rail Corridor, considering what will best meet the needs of local communities, First Nations and people in the region.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The upgrades were completed in November 2019.“Traffic continues to grow rapidly along the Gateway to Abbotsford,” Begg said. “We have improved safety by making intersections better, reduced lineups and delays by opening more lanes for drivers, and created more space for cyclists and pedestrians with new bike paths and sidewalks to encourage more active transportation. All of these upgrades bring welcome relief for people travelling to and from the Abbotsford airport.”These improvements support the growing flow of traffic that is accessing the\\xa0Abbotsford International Airport, as well as boosting safety for commercial and local traffic.“The widening of Mount Lehman Road to the Abbotsford International Airport is a significant step forward for local and regional travellers and provides a needed link for the continued movement of goods and people to and from the Trans-Canada Highway corridor,” said Braun. “The City of Abbotsford greatly appreciates the federal and provincial governments’ continued investment in our community as we continue to build the hub of the Fraser Valley.”Quick Facts:\\nApproximately 6,000 vehicles per day currently use the Mount Lehman corridor.

It takes place on the territories of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations.“The march honours the beloved daughters, sisters, mothers, aunties and friends whose lives were stolen by violence. It is also a tribute to the strength and determination of those, led by Indigenous women, elders, families and community members, who have been powerful activists to end violence against Indigenous women and girls. It is these grassroots advocates who have been first in line to hold authorities to account in the fight for justice to keep women and girls safe.“Ensuring the safety of Indigenous women requires listening to, and working with, Indigenous women. Our government is committed to doing just that. We need to improve the safety of Indigenous women and girls by addressing and educating people about the underlying causes of systemic violence and racism that lead to their victimization at home, in the workplace and in industry, including addressing the social effects of industrial work camps. Together, we must continue to raise awareness that gender-based violence has no place in our lives.“Today’s memorial march includes a private ceremony where friends and family share memories of the women whose lives were stolen. As the march progresses through the Downtown Eastside, stops are made where women or girls were last seen or where they were murdered. These women are not statistics – they are people, who are loved, and whose loss leaves a wound in those they left behind.“Today, let us join in remembering them, and resolve to work together toward a future in which Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit and gender-diverse people feel safe, secure and equal in every community in this province.”\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

This information will be used to improve supports and services, measure progress in addressing homelessness and increase public awareness.“Homelessness in B.C. continues to be a struggle for people, and the barriers that they face vary in different communities,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Our second provincial homeless count is a way that, together, we can get a clearer understanding of what homelessness looks like in order to better support some of the most vulnerable people in B.C.”The homeless counts give government a better sense of the complex challenges that people are facing. This initiative is part of informing the Province’s actions to tackle homelessness in B.C., as outlined in the Province’s first poverty reduction strategy, TogetherBC. The strategy, released in 2019, outlines programs and policies across government that will lift people out of poverty by removing barriers, creating social inclusion and continuing to focus on reconciliation.The Province will use new and complementary methods in 2020. Two communities, Cranbrook and Port Alberni,\\xa0will pilot extended, multi-day counts to provide information on people who may be missed in a one-day count.\\xa0Government will work with Indigenous partners to highlight Indigenous perspectives of homelessness and create effective strategies for addressing and preventing homlessness among Indigenous peoples.“HSABC is working with our members and partners in participating communities to implement the 2020 homeless counts,” said Stephen D’Souza, executive director, HSABC. “It is the work of these local organizations that ensures the counts are a success. Across the province, there are teams of volunteers helping conduct the count and hosting community events for people to count themselves in.“We are still seeking volunteers to help with the homeless counts.

       "  '\\n\\nMore people with Parkinson’s are benefiting from treatment with deep brain stimulation (DBS), a program developed to help people whose symptoms can no longer be controlled with medication.On Feb. 5, 2019, government announced improved access to DBS for people with Parkinson’s disease through establishing and expanding a provincial program with a five-point plan that the Ministry of Health developed with Vancouver Coastal Health to address wait times.“Since we first introduced our action plan in 2019, there has been significant progress and the Province has doubled the number of primary insertion DBS surgeries,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “When I first became minister of health, the number of surgeries performed was 31. I’m proud to report that we are on track to achieve Vancouver Coastal Health’s target of 72 primary insertions for fiscal year 2019-20, up from the existing 36, which will represent a 125% increase over the previous fiscal year. We’ve also reduced\\xa0wait times by 13 weeks in the first year. The number of patients on the wait-list has dropped\\xa0and will continue to drop with more progress to come. This is excellent news for those with Parkinson’s disease.”Dr. Gary Redekop, head of neurosurgery, Vancouver Coastal Health, said, “People throughout B.C. with Parkinson’s disease have already benefited from expanded access to deep brain stimulation procedures. We are committed to continue to support the health, wellness and active lifestyles of our patients, and with these expanded services, we are seeing more people with Parkinson’s disease accessing this life-changing surgery.”The plan used public health-care system solutions to increase the number of procedures by 100%.\\xa0Beginning April 1, 2019, this program began maintaining a centralized wait-list and increased operating room time for DBS procedures. This plan has addressed wait times for almost all DBS patients, with the number of patients waiting for DBS and their average wait time decreasing between January 2019 and January 2020 from 74 patients waiting 53 weeks to 39 patients waiting 40 weeks.DBS is a highly specialized procedure, with few clinicians across the country trained to perform it. In British Columbia, DBS patients receive care at Vancouver acute sites and from one surgeon located at Vancouver General Hospital. DBS uses electrical impulses to stimulate a target area in the brain. The stimulation affects movement by altering the activity in that area of the brain. The procedure does not destroy any brain tissue, and stimulation can be changed or stopped at any time. Surgery is required to implant the equipment that produces the electrical stimulation.The formal establishment and expansion of the provincial DBS program is in addition to the government’s surgical strategy to increase surgical volumes through targeted investment and maximizing best practices and efficiencies. The surgical strategy is supported with ongoing targeted funding of $75 million in 2018-19, increased to $100 million in 2019-20.Quick Facts:\\nParkinson’s is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms may include tremors, stiff muscles, slow movement and/or problems with balance or walking.\\nPatients are typically eligible when medications to control motor function are ineffective.\\nBenefits of DBS can include fewer tremors, improved facial expression and reductions in medication.\\nLearn More:View the Deep Brain Stimulation 2019-20 Annual Report: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/DBS-20192020-annual-report.pdfView the original announcement: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019HLTH0029-000159\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

In two years, government has made significant investments in priorities identified with Indigenous peoples, including long-term revenue sharing, language revitalization, funding for Aboriginal friendship centres, culturally appropriate health care and mental-health supports, and Indigenous housing on- and off-reserve. Building on the legislature’s unanimous passage of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, the next step is an action plan, which government will develop in consultation and co-operation with Indigenous peoples.CleanBC is a critical part of this government’s strategy to grow a sustainable economy that works for people. As CleanBC enters its second year, B.C. will keep working to reduce emissions and grow opportunities in B.C.’s technology and innovation sectors. This year, B.C. will release a climate adaptation strategy to make sure communities are ready for changes in weather and other climate impacts, and an action plan to reduce plastic pollution and keep it out of B.C. landfills and waterways.Investments in technology and innovation are transforming B.C.’s economy across all sectors. This year, government will work with business to promote B.C. industries as competitive suppliers of low-carbon products. Technology and innovation are combining with B.C.’s long-standing strengths in natural resources to help ensure a resilient, sustainable economy that creates good jobs and opportunities for people. Government continues to support forestry workers and communities as the industry transitions, and is bringing industry, workers, local governments and First Nations together to find local solutions to help the industry stay competitive. Forestry, mining, agriculture and energy continue to generate good jobs for people. These industries will play a leading role in supporting innovation that helps B.C. achieve its economic, climate and reconciliation goals.B.C. remains an economic leader in Canada, with the lowest unemployment rate for two years running, and high business optimism. Government will continue to grow a strong, sustainable economy by investing in people and the services they count on, promoting a competitive business environment, and moving forward on its commitments on climate action and reconciliation.“British Columbians are more prepared to face the challenges of today and tomorrow, because they have a government that is a partner in their future,” Premier Horgan said. “We’re going to continue the work we started two and a half years ago, to make life better for people, so that B.C. can once again be a place of hope and opportunity – a stronger province, for everyone.”Government is making progress on the shared priorities outlined in the Confidence and Supply Agreement, with the BC Green Party caucus.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

All four cases are in stable condition and are recovering in isolation at home. All close contacts of these cases are being followed closely by public health officials and remain asymptomatic.“On Tuesday, Feb. 4, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) public health lab identified the second presumed positive test for 2019-nCoV in British Columbia. On Thursday, Feb. 6, two additional presumed positive cases were identified in the same household. Samples were sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg for additional testing. Those results returned positive for 2019-nCoV, bringing the total number of cases confirmed by the NML in B.C. to four.“As of Feb. 7, BCCDC has tested a total of 371 samples for 2019-nCoV. The testing numbers are posted each Friday on the BCCDC website. In B.C., we have selected testing criteria with an intentionally low threshold to ensure a wide range of people are eligible for 2019-nCoV testing.“The second Canadian-operated repatriation flight carrying returning Canadians from Wuhan, China, arrived at the Vancouver International Airport late on Monday, Feb 10. The aircraft refuelled and proceeded to Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Trenton in Ontario. No crew members or passengers remained in B.C.“The returning Canadians will spend 14 days at CFB Trenton, which is the 2019-nCoV maximum incubation period, so they can be assessed and monitored, and to support their transition back to Canada.“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within B.C. remains low at this time. We are watching the evolution of the outbreak in China closely and will notify the public if the measures we need to take in B.C. change.“Now is the time for tolerance. We call on all British Columbians to come together as a community to help one another. In this time of uncertainty, this is not only the right response, but the necessary one. Fear obstructs the important work of our public health officials to protect the health and safety of British Columbians.“Together with our federal and provincial partners, we ask people who have recently visited, or who have been in close contact with, someone who has recently visited the Hubei province in China to call public health officials and self-isolate for 14 days.“The most important measures to prevent all respiratory illnesses, including 2019-nCoV, remain cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you become sick.\\xa0“Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, 2019-nCoV should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811.

We stand together to acknowledge the immense contribution that women continue to make to science and other fields like technology, engineering and mathematics. We pledge to do all that we can to remove the barriers that hold girls and women back from participating fully in these fields.“We know that gender equity supports a strong, inclusive economy. That is why we are taking real steps to make life more affordable, improve the services people count on and build\\xa0that strong, inclusive economy. For example, our investments in child care, the largest in B.C.’s history, will help parents, especially women, raise families while pursuing their careers.“The pathway to inclusion is supported through education. Our government is investing in the futures of girls and women through scholarships and co-op opportunities, and through projects that look at how\\xa0best to attract, retain and support the career advancement of equity-seeking groups, including women in tech-related sectors. These investments will inspire a new generation of women to consider science and technology-based professions.“Let’s all work together to bridge the gender gap and open doors to a future free of any inequalities.

The first of these will open Feb. 10 and end May 11, 2020. Successful applicants will be notified by August 2020. A second application window is scheduled to open in November 2020, ending Feb. 10, 2021.This approach enables the Province to compare applications over a set timeframe. This will allow funding to be targeted to organizations and communities best able to meet child care shortages in their areas and to prioritize applications that create child care spaces that will remain community assets for the long term. As well, communities that have recently completed\\xa0child care needs assessments will have more time to develop targeted applications based on what they have learned.In addition, to ensure funding is being used for new licensed child care spaces in as many communities as possible, and based on best practices identified through the\\xa015 months\\xa0of the program, the Province will prioritize projects with a cost per space of $40,000 or less.Applicants will be required to demonstrate:\\nthe link between their proposed project and the need within their community;\\nreference to a community child care plan or needs assessment, such as those created through the Union of British Columbia Municipalities’ Community Child Care Planning Grant program; and\\nthat any necessary professional, administrative and consulting services total no more than 15% of the total provincially funded project cost.\\nLearn More:For more information on the changes and to view the new guidelines, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/newspacesfund\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

This is all part of our work to keep people and goods moving as we build a strong, sustainable B.C.”The nearly $1.4-billion Pattullo Bridge Replacement Project is being delivered under the Province’s Community Benefits Agreement (CBA), which prioritizes hiring local workers, including Indigenous peoples, women, people with disabilities and other under-represented groups who are qualified to do the work, in a safe, welcoming work environment. This project will help diversify and grow B.C.’s skilled workforce by providing opportunities for Red Seal apprentices to work on site and gain the experience they need to launch good careers in the trades.“The Pattullo Bridge is a critical crossing for residents and commercial truck drivers,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “With today’s milestone announcement, we’re one step closer to a safer, more efficient crossing that will benefit thousands of people every day. What’s also great about this project is that it will – using the Community Benefits Agreement – provide jobs for local people, increase work experience opportunities for apprentices and help mobilize a strong construction workforce for British Columbia.”The four-lane bridge will have wider lanes and better connections into Surrey and New Westminster, improving ease of travel on this corridor for locals and commercial vehicles. The design includes dedicated pedestrian and cyclist lanes, separated from traffic, that will improve safety for all road users and encourage active transportation options. The bridge will be built to allow for potential future expansion to six lanes. Construction will begin in the coming months. The new bridge is scheduled to open in fall 2023.“Women in the trades have been under-represented for decades, and so I am excited that Indigenous peoples, women and other equity-seeking groups will be seen as assets to this project,” said Danielle Shaw, a recently journeyed welder from Ironworkers Local 97. “Priority apprentice hiring on a job like the Pattullo Bridge Replacement project ensures that under-represented groups have more access to these living-wage careers.

To ensure water sustainability, ministry staff, in partnership with Cowichan Tribes, are looking at the feasibility of using new tools in the Water Sustainability Act to better manage the Koksilah Watershed.“Cowichan Tribes appreciates that action is being taken by the Province to look after the Koksilah Watershed in partnership with us. Help for the Koksilah River is long overdue,” said Chief William Seymour of Cowichan Tribes. “Climate change is causing repeated droughts year after year and massive flooding like we saw this week. We can’t wait any longer. We need to work together, government to government and with all the affected people in the community, to deal with this and plan for a better future. A water sustainability plan sounds like a possible way forward, and we’re pleased to have the opportunity to pursue that together with the Province in our territory.”The Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development has the jurisdiction to implement the provincial Water Sustainability Act. However, the newly signed interim letter of agreement commits the ministry and Cowichan Tribes to collaborate and jointly oversee and participate in a long-term planning process for the management of the Koksilah Watershed.“I was truly heartened to witness the signing of this agreement between Chief Seymour and Minister Donaldson today,” said\\xa0Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “This type of government-to-government agreement is an example of reconciliation in action\\xa0and something we need to see more of. It is an important step towards the long-term protection of the Koksilah Watershed.”This agreement also reflects the B.C. government’s commitment to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.Quick Fact:\\nIn August 2019, a ministerial order under the Water Sustainability Act was issued to specific water users (including surface and groundwater licensees, and unlicensed groundwater users) to stop using water, in an effort to help protect fish populations in the Koksilah Watershed.

They will make the necessary repairs to reopen the trail section as soon as it is safe to do so.The ministry thanks people for their patience during the closure of this popular trail and will advise the public when it has reopened.The\\xa0Cowichan Valley experienced more than 440 millimetres of rainfall in January 2020, which is over 225% of the climate normal.

       "  '\\n\\nChild care is getting less expensive and easier to find in the Cowichan Valley as the Province invests in nearly 120 new child care spaces to give more parents the option to return to work, go back to school or pursue other opportunities.“As a working mom, I understand the challenges that parents face in trying to juggle their work and home life,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “By partnering with the local school district, we’re ensuring that more families have access to inclusive child care that ensures all children have what they need to thrive.”Through the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, the Cowichan Valley School District (No. 79) is receiving funding to support the creation of three new school-based child care centres. They will be located at Alexander Elementary, Mill Bay Elementary and Palsson Elementary. Each centre will provide 37 licensed child care spaces – 12 infant/toddler spaces and 25 spaces for children aged three to five. The school district expects the new centres to open in September 2020.\\xa0The centres will offer a variety of wraparound services, including support for families with lower incomes, such as providing free snacks to children, as well as clothing, books and blankets, if needed. The school district will work with Sun Drops Supported Child Care Centre to make programming more accessible for children who need extra supports. In addition, supports will also be available to young parents and families who are new to Canada.“These new child care spaces will create a strong foundation for children in the Cowichan Valley, setting them up for life-long success,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “The centres will be learning hubs where children begin their educational journeys, as well as inclusive, safe spaces where families can come together to benefit from many other programs and opportunities.”As well as the three school-based facilities, Britters Critters Daycare is receiving both a startup grant and funding through the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund to create seven new spaces for children under the age of 12. Programming will include outdoor activities, such as gardening, to encourage children to learn through exploring nature, as well as teaching children about the culture and history of the local Cowichan Tribes and other Indigenous peoples. In addition, the provider will work closely with Sun Drops to ensure that programming is inclusive for children with extra support needs.“I am delighted about the newest investment in child care spaces in the Cowichan Valley,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “The BC Green caucus is a strong advocate for investing in child care and wraparound services for young families, recognizing both are critical to supporting healthy, resilient communities. Aligning early childhood care and learning with our existing schools is a wonderful way to further invest in our public education system, while we create spaces that work well for parents with multiple kids.”Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in the Cowichan Valley region save more than $5.2 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Candace Spilsbury, chair, Board of Education for the Cowichan Valley School District –“The board of education is thrilled at the continued investment into child care spaces in the Cowichan Valley. These additional spaces will continue to help families in our communities access good quality, reliable and professional child care for their little ones. We continue to be grateful to work alongside the ministry and our service providers to deliver these child care spaces to our communities.”Brittnie Schwab, owner, Britters Critters Daycare –\"When I began looking for child care for my young son, I found that every centre had no spaces and long waitlists. When I began looking into opening my own centre, the local child care resource and referral team told me about the grants that were available to apply for. These grants have made it possible for me to build a fence and purchase resources and toys for my facility. I felt very supported while working through the application process.

       "  \"\\n\\nFor the first time, B.C.'s\\xa0children and youth in care will be recognized through a new supplement when funding is allocated to school districts next month.This change will also expand priority funding to more children with mental-health challenges and those living in low-income families.“We’ve heard loud and clear that years of neglect have left far too many of our most vulnerable children not getting the supports they need to be engaged and successful in school,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Our government is doing things differently by putting the success and well-being of students first, while ensuring equity in the way we fund public education.”Money allocated for this new supplement will be provided to school boards to deliver services based on local needs. These funds are intended for supports like trauma counselling, school breakfast or lunch programs, additional support in the classroom, recognizing mental-health issues and early intervention, or tutoring. Recognizing these students for priority funding will ensure the more than $6 billion in record operating funding is distributed in a way that better represents the number of vulnerable students in B.C. schools. The amount of money allocated for the supplement will be announced following Budget 2020.This is part one of a two-phase plan to improve the way education is delivered in B.C., following the completion of a comprehensive review that examined ways to ensure every child has equal and consistent access to a quality education, no matter their circumstances or where they live. The review involved an unprecedented level of consultation, including all 60 school districts and over 350 education stakeholders. \\xa0Former youth in care already are benefiting from the post-secondary Tuition Waiver Program, and these changes will pave the way for success beginning at an early age. The move builds on broader government efforts, including the poverty reduction strategy TogetherBC, a Pathway to Hope roadmap for mental health, and prioritizing children and youth in care.“We want to give every child and youth in care the chance to thrive and overcome challenges they could face,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “From an early age, right through school, high school\\xa0and post-secondary, we’re working to support children and youth, help guide them and make sure they can access the services they need in order to succeed.”In 2018, the Province appointed an independent review panel to undertake a review of how public education is funded for the first time in almost 30 years. The panel recommended making improvements to ensure greater equity, accountability and financial management, so all students are supported to reach their full potential.As part of the equity recommendations, Indigenous students will continue to benefit from targeted funding for culturally appropriate support and services. There will also be added accountability through formal processes, so Indigenous parents, communities and governments can provide input into how educational services are delivered to their children. This builds upon ongoing work to prioritize Indigenous students, including a 30% increase in funding since 2016-17.The Ministry of Education will work collaboratively with school boards and other partners to implement improved public accountability, including ensuring school districts:\\xa0\\nengage parents, caregivers and community members in the development of school districts' strategic plans, well in advance of setting their budgets, to meet student needs;\\xa0\\xa0\\ncontinuously monitor and publicly report on student outcomes, such as numeracy, literacy and graduation rates, so gaps in student achievement are identified and services can be planned based on proven strategies; and\\xa0\\xa0\\nensure strategic plans and financial decisions are focused on improving student outcomes and meeting all students’ needs, including inclusive education, Indigenous education, students from low-income families and other vulnerable students.\\nThese new accountability and transparency measures will give parents and caregivers a stronger voice, while making sure students’ needs are put first.\\xa0The ministry will continue to work on the remainder of the recommendations with school boards and other partners – including parents, support staff, teachers, Indigenous communities and inclusive-education advocacy groups.This work will include testing and piloting strategies to improve how inclusive education is delivered so students receive the services and supports they need, when they need them, no matter where they live. Ongoing work will ensure the unique costs of running schools in rural and remote districts throughout the province are recognized and prioritized when funding is allocated. \\xa0“The previous government imposed decisions with no consultation, and that’s why we said all along that we will take the time necessary to get this right. We need to make sure all children can benefit from the changes we make,” Fleming said. \\xa0“We’re glad that the ministry is taking the initial step in moving forward with the necessary process of improving the funding model,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “This process has given us critical information about the student population that was unavailable when the current model was created. We remain committed to working with the ministry toward finding a more student-focused way of distributing education dollars to local boards of education.”Education funding is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.“The BC Green caucus supports the funding model changes announced today, particularly the emphasis on supporting vulnerable children and youth in care,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “Our collective goal must be to ensure that all children have the opportunity to thrive. This means continuing to work with our partners in the education system to find the best ways to fund the supports that our students need.”Quick Facts:\\nGovernment is supporting B.C. students with a record $6.6 billion a year, which is $1 billion more than in 2016-17.\\nSince 2016-17, student enrolment has increased by 3.2% while, at the same time, education funding has increased by 17.1%, including a 30% increase to support Indigenous education and a 29% increase to support inclusive education.\\nMore than 1,100 former youth in care are benefiting from post-secondary or trades training through the Tuition Waver Program program, which was introduced in the 2017-18 school year.\\xa0\\nIn early 2019, the Province launched TogetherBC, British Columbia’s first-ever poverty reduction strategy.

       "  '\\n\\nRenters will be able to receive their security and pet deposits back in a fair and timely manner, thanks to changes made by the Government of B.C.“Renters should not have to go through a time-consuming process to have their deposits returned to them,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are taking action to make the residential tenancy system work better for landlords and tenants, and this is another step in making sure everyone is treated fairly.”Under the old process, renters had to apply for a dispute resolution hearing if their landlord did not return their uncontested deposits within 15 days of the end of the rental agreement. This formal hearing with the Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) meant that renters had to wait to have their money returned to them.To solve this, the Province is creating an expedited process. Renters with successful applications will receive an order for the return of the deposit that they can then serve to their landlord or enforce through the small claims court. The RTB has a similar process in place to help landlords recover unpaid rent or utilities. These changes give renters the ability to use the same simplified process to get their deposit back.“The Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre (TRAC) supports the decision to make the RTB’s direct request process available to tenants seeking the recovery of their security and pet damage deposits. We regularly hear from tenants whose landlords refuse to return deposits without justification, knowing that the time and hassle of the standard dispute-resolution process will lead many to simply give up,” said Andrew Sakamoto, executive director, TRAC. “TRAC hopes this change will both enable tenants to better stand up for their rights and discourage unscrupulous landlords from illegally retaining deposits.”Renters can apply for this expedited process in person at the RTB office in Burnaby, at any Service BC location or online (effective Feb. 18, 2020).“The use of a direct request for the return of security deposits is a constructive step to improve the efficiency of the process for both tenants and landlords,” said David Hutniak, chief executive officer, LandlordBC. “Landlords claiming to retain part or all of the deposits to recoup the cost of damages to their rental suites will continue to have access to a participatory hearing, which ensures that they will be able to state their case to an arbitrator. Overall, we expect this new process to work well.”This new process is the next step in the phased implementation of the Rental Housing Task Force’s recommendations to make B.C.’s rental housing system fairer, more affordable and more secure.Action on housing and ensuring fairness for renters and landlords are shared priorities between government and the BC Green Party caucus and are\\xa0part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: \\nThis change is in response to recommendation 18 of the Rental Housing Task Force, which was to speed up the return of security deposits by allowing tenants to make a direct request to the RTB where the landlord has not made a claim.\\nThe new process is among the many changes that government has made to improve renting in B.C., including:\\nchanging the laws to provide stronger protection for renters facing eviction as a result of renovations or demolitions by increasing compensation for bad-faith evictions, strengthening requirements for eviction notifications, allowing more time to find alternative housing and giving renters the right of refusal to return to a unit following renovations;\\nupdating tenancy laws to close what is known as the fixed-term lease loophole, eliminating the geographic rent increase clause and better protecting people living in manufactured home parks;\\ninvesting $6.8 million in new funding for the RTB to reduce wait times for tenancy disputes, hire new staff to reduce wait times and address backlog and create a new compliance unit to take action against serious offenders;\\ncutting the annual allowable rent increase by 2%, limiting it to inflation, to help ease pressure on renters; and\\nimproving the Rental Assistance Program and Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters to give families and seniors on fixed income a break from rising costs.\\n\\nLearn More: Residential Tenancy Branch website: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenanciesOnline application for dispute resolution (service portal):\\xa0www.gov.bc.ca/landlordtenant/online\\n\\nResidential Housing Task Force recommendations: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/app/uploads/sites/121/2018/12/RHTF-Recommendations-and-WWH-Report_Dec2018_FINAL.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAdrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.\\'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in British Columbia:“We are announcing two new cases of novel coronavirus in B.C. The people affected are in the same household and have been in close contact with the previously reported second confirmed case announced on Feb. 5. The three cases and all close contacts remain in isolation at home.“The two individuals are presumed positive based on local testing, and samples have been sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for final confirmation. One individual is male, the other female, and both are in their 30s. They are visitors to the Vancouver Coastal Health region from Hubei province, China.“Vancouver Coastal Health continues to investigate. Their close contacts have been identified and continue to be followed by the health authority.\"Our knowledge of 2019-nCoV continues to grow as new information becomes available. Across the country, the federal, provincial and territorial governments are using this new evidence to inform and adjust our public health actions as circumstances develop globally.“We want to reassure people that the risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia remains low at this time. We are watching the situation very closely and will notify the public if measures in B.C. change. The goal is rapid identification of potential cases, timely care for those who need it and prevention of local transmission.“Now is the time for tolerance. We call on all British Columbians to come together as a community to help one another. In this time of uncertainty, this is not only the right response, but the necessary one. Fear obstructs the important work of our public health officials to protect the health and safety of British Columbians.“The most important measures to prevent all respiratory illnesses, including this novel coronavirus, remain cleaning your hands regularly and avoiding touching your face, as well as coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you become sick.“As we recommended in our last briefing, and together with our federal and provincial partners, we ask people who have recently visited, or who have been in close contact with someone who has recently visited the Hubei province in China, to call public health officials and self-isolate for 14 days.“Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, the coronavirus should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811.

       "  '\\n\\nGovernment is transforming ICBC by removing lawyers and legal costs from the system to reduce rates and substantially increase care benefits, making public auto insurance work for British Columbians again.Legislation will be introduced in the coming weeks that will lower ICBC premiums by approximately 20% – an average of $400 in savings per driver. At the same time, maximum care and treatment benefits for anyone injured in a crash will increase to at least $7.5 million, and new benefits will provide care for those most seriously injured, for as long as they need it. These benefits will be available to every British Columbian without having to hire a lawyer.These improvements will be achieved by removing the majority of legal fees and other costs associated with the current litigation-based system. The new care-based insurance system is forecast to remove more than $1.5 billion in the first full year, savings that will be passed on to ICBC customers through lowered insurance rates.To give British Columbians confidence that they will be treated fairly, the planned legislation will require ICBC, by law, to assist every person who makes a claim and endeavour to ensure they receive all of the care and benefits to which they are entitled. Customers who still have complaints or disputes about their claim, benefit payments or fairness issues will not need a lawyer to have them resolved. They will have recourse through:\\nthe Civil Resolution Tribunal, which is independent of ICBC;\\nthe B.C. ombudsperson; and\\nthe upcoming ICBC fairness officer, who will be appointed by government to ensure greater independence from ICBC.\\nAs ICBC transitions to this new care-based model, government’s previous work to improve the finances at ICBC means there will be no basic rate change this year. The 0% basic rate change that takes effect on April 1, 2020, is the lowest any government has delivered in almost a decade. Without significant changes, rates would need to continue to rise by about 35% over the next five years.Highlights of Enhanced Care coverage:Government will introduce legislation to create the new care-based system, which would take effect on May 1, 2021, so that British Columbians will benefit from:\\naverage savings of $400 on their premium, compared with the previous full-year policy;\\ncare and treatment benefits that are 24 times higher than today, up to at least $7.5 million;\\nwage loss coverage that is 60% higher than today; and\\nnew benefits – such as benefits for full-time students, caregivers, those working in the family business or those approaching retirement, who suffer income loss following a crash – replacing lump-sum payments that were previously awarded only\\xa0through lengthy and expensive litigation.\\nQuotes: Premier John Horgan –“It’s time for change at ICBC. The old government ignored ICBC’s problems, allowing it to become a system that made lawyers rich, while drivers paid too much for insurance. We’re going to transform ICBC to lower rates for B.C. drivers – saving you an average of $400 on your insurance, while also improving care for people who have been injured in a crash.”David Eby, Attorney General –“You shouldn’t need a lawyer to access the benefits you’ve paid for. By removing expensive lawyers and legal fees from the system, we are making ICBC work for British Columbians again with more affordable insurance rates and much better coverage, so anyone injured in a crash gets the care they need.”Christine Bradstock, CEO, Physiotherapy Association of BC –“As physiotherapists, we often see patients who require longer treatment times in order to fully recover or get back to full function. With these changes, patients will have the peace of mind knowing that their care and treatment benefits will be there when they need them and for as long as they need to get better and return to their daily lives.”Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC –“As physicians, our priority is to ensure that patients get the best possible care. The new care-based model provides significantly better coverage for people injured in traffic accidents through major increases in the level of medical care and supports for recovery. Doctors of BC looks forward to working with government and ICBC to help inform the transition to this enhanced care model.”Quick Facts:\\nSimilar care-based insurance systems exist in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Those systems have kept rate changes steady, near 0%.\\nUnder Enhanced Care coverage, a driver who is responsible for a crash will continue to be found at fault.\\xa0This will remain a primary factor in what drivers pay for their insurance. If a driver causes a crash, their premiums will go up.\\nThose injured by dangerous drivers convicted of certain Criminal Code offences, such as impaired driving, will still be able to sue for additional compensation.\\nLearn More:Government is taking action to limit the use of a disproportionate number of expert reports in litigation, through planned changes to the Evidence Act.

Total recoverable disbursements in motor vehicle personal injury cases will also be limited to 5% of the judgment or settlement. Disbursements include all expenses incurred for the purpose of a lawsuit, such as courier fees, process servers and photocopying, but will not include fees payable to the Crown, such as filing fees, court fees and jury fees.Government will also proceed with amendments to legislation to limit the number of experts and expert reports that can be used in court on the issue of damages, while providing judicial discretion to allow additional expert reports in appropriate cases. For fast-track claims (e.g., under $100,000) there will be a limit of one expert and expert report for each party. A maximum of three experts and reports for each party will be set for all other claims.

Government is making education and training accessible where people live so that everyone can get good, family-supporting jobs in or near their communities. The Good Jobs Guide shows people real, practical ways they can prepare themselves for future employment in their chosen field.”The Good Jobs Guide will be a valuable information resource for all British Columbians, especially parents, prospective students, job seekers, educators and businesses. The guide shows where, when and what kinds of jobs are expected to be available in B.C. between 2019 and 2029, along with wages and the type of education and/or training required.“The Good Jobs Guide is an excellent tool to help grow B.C.’s talent pool and support economic development throughout all regions of the province,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “With a strong workforce in place, we are attracting more investments, expanding the innovation economy\\xa0and adding more family-supporting jobs throughout the province.”As in past years, the forecast shows that there will be a wide range of job opportunities – good news for people looking for their first job, thinking of changing jobs, or getting back into the job market.“When people have meaningful work, it improves their quality of life and provides them with opportunity, while connecting them to their community,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “In the next 10 years, there will be hundreds of thousands of new job openings throughout the province. The Good Job Guide will help people find career paths that are right for them and their families. Initiatives like these are an investment in our communities and help us in building a stronger B.C.”The Good Jobs Guide shows how people can prepare for work by using existing supports such as WorkBC centres, WorkBC.ca, the education planner and the career guide for Indigenous peoples.

       "  '\\n\\nFunding is in place and plans are moving ahead to rebuild and realign West Fraser Road, replacing the road that was heavily damaged by flooding in 2018.Once complete, the new road will provide local people with a safe, reliable and efficient roadway to get to and from their homes, schools, jobs and appointments.“The West Fraser Road washout has had significant impacts to people and local communities, and we are committed to a long-term solution,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “I appreciate people’s patience throughout this very challenging time. The ministry continues to work on maintaining the alternative route, while ensuring safe travel through the area by building a new road.”In April 2018, high water levels from the spring freshet caused Narcosli Creek to erode five sections of West Fraser Road on the west side of the Fraser River, approximately 17 kilometres south of Quesnel. The damage was severe, resulting in the road being closed over a three-kilometre section.“We are pleased the funding is in place and the rebuilding of the West Fraser Road will start,” said Chief Roy Stump and Councillors William Baptiste, Howard Johnny and Chad Stump of the ?Esdilagh First Nation. “There has been a significant impact to our community since the washout of the West Fraser Road. With the washout, we travel a longer distance to get to Quesnel and our children have had to endure additional travel time to get to school, reducing their time at home. Realigning the West Fraser Road will provide ?Esdilagh with the proper egress route to Quesnel and decrease the amount of industry traffic we have to encounter – overall, providing more safety for our members.”The ministry is finalizing the detailed design for the new road, which will bypass the active slide areas along the section washed out in 2018. Work will include the construction of five kilometres of two-lane road on a new alignment, a new bridge crossing Narcosli Creek and rock stabilization work along the new route.Upon completion of the final engineering design activities, the ministry will hold a public information session in spring 2020 to share the finalized design and project timelines. Construction is expected to begin later this year. Completion is slated for late 2022.Since the washout, a detour route has been in place via the Garner and Webster Lake Road system. Government has invested nearly $2 million to improve the route. Local ministry staff and the maintenance contractor continue to ensure the detour remains safe and reliable for road users.Quick Facts:\\nThe project, which is estimated to cost up to $103.4 million, has been approved in principle for funding support through Public Safety Canada’s Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangement.\\nWest Fraser Road provides access to the ?Esdilagh First Nation community, ranches, logging activities, farming lands and local residences.\\nLearn More:For more information on West Fraser Road, including aerial washout footage, visit: https://www.gov.bc.ca/westfraserroad\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Laboratory testing results returned positive from the BC Centre for Disease Control late Monday, Feb. 3, and\\xa0samples have been sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation. Vancouver Coastal Health is undertaking a detailed case investigation and will follow up with each of her close contacts. The individual had close contact with family visitors from Wuhan city and is in isolation at home.“Our knowledge of 2019-nCoV continues to grow as new information becomes available. Across the country, federal, provincial and territorial governments are using this new evidence to inform and adjust our public health actions as circumstances develop globally.“As the federal government works to bring returning Canadians home from Wuhan, the decision was made to quarantine passengers from the special charter flight for 14 days. These individuals are returning from the most intensely affected areas of China, and they will receive psychosocial and medical support upon their return, as well as consular services.“We are working closely with public health officials across Canada. Our focus is on people\\xa0in British Columbia. Given the changing dynamics of the outbreak in China and globally, and recognizing we are in the midst of influenza season, we ask anyone here in B.C. who has been in Hubei province to consider staying home and keeping their children home until 14 days have passed from their last visit to Hubei. Monitor yourself and your children closely for symptoms, and if any symptoms arise, connect with your primary care provider, local public health office\\xa0or call 811. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time. We are watching the evolution of the outbreak in China very closely and will notify the public if the measures we need to take in B.C. change.“The most important measures to prevent all respiratory illnesses including this novel coronavirus remain cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you become sick.\\xa0“Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, the coronavirus should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811.

B.C. has certainly benefited from Dr. Winter’s tenure as innovation commissioner and his contributions to building B.C.’s tech-enabled economy.“On behalf of the B.C. government, I want to thank Dr. Winter for his dedication and excellence in growing B.C.’s tech and innovation sector. He has built bridges for the sector and presented the B.C. government with opportunities to expand current successes. I wish him all the best in his future endeavours.“Since his appointment two years ago, Dr. Winter has travelled throughout B.C.\\xa0to gather an understanding of the opportunities and challenges facing its regions. He has also met with nearly 450 organizations, including international companies and federal government agencies, and led investment and trade missions to the U.S., Europe and Asia.“His work has resulted in many positive relationships and outcomes, including B.C. companies receiving funding from international and national sources, such as the federal government’s Strategic Investment Fund and Sustainable Development Technology Canada.

Monthly rents will range from approximately $1,200 for a studio, to $1,650 for a two-bedroom and $1,850 for a large two-bedroom rental.Through the HousingHub, the Province is providing approximately $11 million in low-cost financing to WestUrban Developments, which will reduce the cost of the project and deliver the anticipated rental rates.These homes will be in a wood-frame, four-storey building, located in the Crown Isle neighbourhood of the city.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Ronna-Rae Leonard, MLA for Courtenay-Comox –“These new homes will give more people in Courtenay an affordable place to call home and help them stay in their community.

It is expected that B.C. will be the final destination for some of the returning Canadians, and we will continue liaising with the federal government as it identifies passengers for the repatriation flight.“The returning Canadians will spend 14 days at CFB Trenton, which is the 2019 novel coronavirus maximum incubation period, so\\xa0they can be assessed and monitored, and to support their transition back to Canada.“In B.C., we have chosen testing criteria with an intentionally low threshold to purposely ensure a wide range of people are eligible for novel coronavirus testing.

Updates will be published each Friday at: www.bccdc.ca“There continues to be one confirmed case in B.C.“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time.

Seats at the college will be added\\xa0so six additional health-care assistant certificate cohorts can run through 2019 and 2020.“We’re so thankful to the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training for providing the funding for NIC to renovate, lease and equip the space at St. Joe’s,” said John Bowman, president, NIC. “We’re now able to meet increasing demand for high-enrolment programs while we seek more permanent solutions to deal with space constraints at our Comox Valley campus.”One-time program funding of $494,000 was provided to NIC to create 60 new seats in one-time health-care assistant programming and health-care assistant prerequisite programming. These NIC programs provide learning and training opportunities close to home for students in the Comox Valley at St. Joseph’s, as well as Campbell River, Port Hardy and the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation on the west coast of Vancouver Island. The 60 new seats are in addition to the existing 40 seats the college already has for health-care assistants.“Increasing the number of health-care assistants in B.C. is a part of government’s commitment to strengthen the staff available to provide services for seniors to ensure they can receive the care they need and deserve,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Health-care assistants have one of the most important jobs of making daily life better for seniors\\xa0by providing compassionate personal care and social interaction, which are\\xa0essential to healthy aging.”An additional capital investment of $600,000 went to renovate this new space and to purchase the equipment that will help students be industry ready. The college signed a four-year lease for the former surgical daycare space on the first floor of the the former St. Joseph’s General Hospital, which has been renovated to include two classrooms, study areas, meeting rooms and teaching labs.NIC’s health-care assistant students began their program in August 2019.

       "  '\\n\\nLes éducateurs et éducatrices à la petite enfance (EPE) de la Colombie-Britannique pourront désormais bénéficier d’un programme élargi de perfectionnement professionnel qui mise sur l’examen des dernières philosophies et techniques d’enseignement, et des derniers programmes scolaires en ce qui a trait aux services de garde.Dirigé par le Early Childhood Pedagogy Network (ECPN) (réseau de pédagogie de la petite enfance), le programme prévoit un investissement de 2\\xa0millions de dollars qui permettra l’embauche de 32\\xa0spécialistes de l’enseignement – appelés pédagogues – à l’échelle de la province. La mise en poste de ces pédagogues favorisera l’accès au perfectionnement professionnel des EPE, et améliorera la qualité des services de garde au profit des enfants et de leurs familles.Chaque pédagogue sera appelé à encadrer jusqu’à 45\\xa0éducateurs à la petite enfance dans son secteur par le biais de centres communautaires aménagés dans 8\\xa0établissements d’enseignement postsecondaire, dans 10\\xa0centres d’orientation pour la garde d’enfants et dans 7\\xa0collectivités autochtones, en collaboration avec la BC Aboriginal Child Care Society (société de services de garde d’enfants autochtones de la Colombie-Britannique).Le programme est le fruit d’un partenariat entre le gouvernement de la province et les chercheurs de l’Université Capilano et de l’Université Western, en Ontario. Cette initiative contribue au rayonnement de la Colombie-Britannique en tant que l’une des deux seules provinces canadiennes à offrir cette forme de soutien aux éducateurs à la petite enfance.«\\xa0Un engagement envers la prestation de soins de qualité est au cœur de notre plan appelé Childcare BC (plan en matière de services de garde d’enfants de la Colombie-Britannique). En réunissant des éducateurs à la petite enfance pour qu’ils puissent partager leurs expériences et apprendre les uns des autres, il nous est possible d’améliorer la qualité des services de garde d’enfants au profit des familles à l’échelle de la Colombie-Britannique\\xa0», a affirmé Katrina Chen, ministre d’État chargée des Services de garde d’enfants. «\\xa0Notre gouvernement est déterminé à aider nos professionnels de l’apprentissage et de la garde de jeunes enfants à réussir. La mise en place de programmes, comme celui-ci, accroît l’attrait et la viabilité d’une carrière en services de garde d’enfants, et est porteuse de changement pour un secteur qui a été trop longtemps négligé.\\xa0»Le programme offre de nouvelles possibilités en matière de perfectionnement professionnel, autres que sous forme de formations ponctuelles, comme des ateliers, en vue de favoriser l’apprentissage continu qui mise sur le perfectionnement au quotidien, dans le cadre de programmes individuels de garde d’enfants.«\\xa0En tant qu’ancienne éducatrice à la petite enfance, je sais que mon apprentissage ne s’est pas arrêté au moment où j’ai décroché mon diplôme. Tous les jours, j’ai dû adapter et affiner mes techniques d’enseignement afin d’offrir de meilleurs services aux familles qui y avaient recours\\xa0», a déclaré Katrine Conroy, ministre des Enfants et du Développement de la Famille. «\\xa0La mise en place de ce réseau permettra aux éducateurs à la petite enfance de collaborer, d’apprendre les uns des autres et d’intégrer de nouvelles théories en matière d’apprentissage à la petite enfance à leur pratique, pour qu’il devienne plus facile pour les familles de poursuivre leur éducation et leur carrière, tout en sachant que l’on veille à l’épanouissement et à l’inspiration de leurs enfants alors qu’ils reçoivent des services de garde.\\xa0»Investir dans les services de garde d’enfants et dans l’éducation à la petite enfance est une priorité commune du gouvernement de la province et du caucus du BC\\xa0Green Party. Cette priorité fait partie de l’accord de confiance et de soutien, le\\xa0Confidence and Supply Agreement.\\xa0Citations\\xa0:Sheila Malcolmson, députée provinciale de Nanaimo –«\\xa0Le fait de pouvoir compter sur plus d’éducateurs à la petite enfance dans Nanaimo se traduit par un soutien accru permettant à nos enfants de grandir et de s’épanouir. Les éducateurs à la petite enfance créent des programmes qui sont une source d’inspiration chez les enfants et qui alimentent chez eux le goût d’apprendre.\\xa0»Sonia Furstenau, députée provinciale de Cowichan Valley –«\\xa0Ce fut un réel plaisir de travailler avec la Dre\\xa0Pacini-Ketchabaw et avec ses collègues, et d’apprendre sous leur tutelle. Je suis ravie de constater que le programme va de l’avant. L’apprentissage dans les premières années de la vie d’un enfant est d’une importance vitale, tout comme le sont les éducateurs à la petite enfance qui enseignent aux jeunes enfants de la Colombie-Britannique, et qui contribuent à leur épanouissement. Nous ne pouvons pas nous intéresser uniquement au nombre de places en service de garde que nous créons. Bien que cela soit important, nous ne devons pas oublier la nécessité de promouvoir et d’améliorer la qualité. J’ai confiance que ce programme nous permettra d’y parvenir.\\xa0»Veronica Pacini-Ketchabaw, codirectrice, B.C. ECPN –«\\xa0Nous souhaitons créer un système dans le cadre duquel les programmes de formation pour EPE sont élaborés à même les collectivités locales, de manière à répondre aux besoins propres à chacune d’entre elles. La mise en place de ce réseau offrira de nouvelles possibilités de perfectionnement professionnel pratique qui sont fondées sur les défis auxquels sont confrontés les EPE et sur les occasions qui s’offrent à eux. En octroyant ce financement, le gouvernement contribue à la création d’un système unifié d’apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants, au sein duquel tous les enfants de la Colombie-Britannique peuvent s’épanouir.\\xa0»Sabrina Limas, étudiante de première année, programme de soins éducatifs à la petite enfance –«\\xa0Travailler avec le pédagogue m’incite à réfléchir aux nouvelles expériences que je peux offrir aux enfants dans le cadre de mon stage. Nous examinons de nouvelles méthodes d’apprentissage et de nouveaux moyens d’utiliser la technologie.

We want to ensure we have a system in place that is adaptable, dependable and convenient.”In October and November 2019, the Province held pre-engagement forums, attended by Trevena, to share ideas on the future of coastal ferry transportation and how ferry service could evolve. Seven meetings were held, where 130 stakeholders shared their ideas.\\xa0The key themes heard at these meetings indicated that coastal ferry services should:\\nsupport efficient end-to-end travel of people and goods;\\nbe equitable and accessible;\\nmitigate and be responsive to climate change; and\\nreflect the values of coastal communities.\\nThe\\xa0information gathered from the public engagement process will be used to develop a provincial vision to guide the future of British Columbia’s coastal ferry service.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

These investments are aimed at getting more people of all abilities active in their communities and involved in a variety of sports.Communities, Indigenous groups and not-for-profit organizations can apply to receive grants that help them buy equipment, train leaders, officials and coaches, and teach participants sport skills.“Thanks to the work of community organizations, sport and physical activities are now more accessible to many British Columbians,” said Steven Guilbeault, federal Minister of Canadian Heritage. “Our government is proud to partner with the Province of British Columbia to offer better sport opportunities to all British Columbians so they can get moving and realize their full potential.”Some of the programs include:\\nteaching introductory or beginner cross-country skiing to people aged 50 and older in Fernie;\\noffering a dedicated beginner learning session for those new to wheelchair basketball in Kamloops; and\\nproviding social sporting opportunities to individuals of all ages with learning disabilities, autism, Down syndrome and other challenges in Pemberton.\\nThe CSDP has two intake periods each year. As part of the fall 2019 intake, the program is funding 32 projects with a total value of $80,970. In Interior B.C., there are 10 programs receiving a total of $23,270.Quotes:Charlene Krepiakevich, CEO, viaSport —“Positive sport experiences have the power to transform individuals and inspire communities. Through this grant, viaSport supports local organizations to create new opportunities for people of all backgrounds, ages and abilities to try organized sport and benefit from that power of sport in their own lives.”Katrine Conroy, MLA for Kootenay West —“Investments in community sport are investments in the health and interconnectedness of our communities. Whether it’s in a gym or out in the mountains, sport can give people opportunities to enjoy some of the best things about where they live. This funding will help more people in the B.C. interior access these benefits.”Madeleine Bragg, Fernie Nordic Society —“Staying active can be a challenge for seniors, especially when there is such a limited number of organized fitness opportunities designed for them in the Elk Valley. Through this grant, the Fernie Master’s Program can offer a safe and affordable way for cross country skiers aged 50 and over to experience the benefits of this great activity and take it into their later stages of life.”Quick Facts:\\nGovernment invests more than $50 million annually to make sure people have equal opportunities to participate in and enjoy the benefits of sport.\\nRecent investments in sport include:\\n$1.46 million to the Indigenous Sport, Physical Activity and Recreation Council to support Team British Columbia’s participation at the 2020 North American Indigenous Games in July 2020 in Halifax.\\n$2.5 million to Sport BC over the next three years to expand KidSport, to increase access for kids who have traditionally faced barriers to getting involved in sport and recreation — including under-represented population groups, such as girls, Indigenous youth and new Canadians.\\n\\nviaSport is the main service delivery partner for government’s sport investments and works with 70 provincial sport organizations that provide programs and services to more than 660,000 provincial sport organization members.\\nLearn More:Read about Sport Canada’s work: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/culture/sport.htmlLearn about viaSport and the grant intake period, guidelines and applications: https://www.viasport.ca/grantsA backgrounder is available online:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Community_Sport_Development_Program_Grant_Recipients_Interior_Fall_2019.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

And we remember how, a century later, Rosemary Brown led the fight on issues of housing, employment and human rights in, and outside of, the B.C. legislature. These are just two of the many Black British Columbians who helped make our great province what it is today.“This month, I encourage everyone in British Columbia to take part in community events for Black History Month and learn about the significant efforts made by Black British Columbians to better our province.“It is the people of this province that make it strong. When we come together and celebrate our diversity, we are not only standing up to racism and discrimination, we are also building a better, stronger British Columbia.”For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_Black-History-Month_FR.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The expansion was made possible thanks to $5.8 million from the Government of Canada’s Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund, $8.6 million from the Government of British Columbia and $3.6 million from NIC and its donors.“Modern learning spaces are a critical part in supporting skills development to prepare students for the jobs of today and tomorrow,” said Navdeep Bains, federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. “The expansion of the Campbell River campus will help students on Vancouver Island advance the next generation of leading-edge research and innovation in Canada.”The project expanded and consolidated learning space at NIC’s Campbell River campus.

       "  '\\n\\nA new protected area next to the recently established Nlhaxten/Cerise Creek Conservancy will help conserve biodiversity, support traditional Indigenous land-use activities and protect cultural landmarks.“We know Pipi7iyekw is a culturally important area for resource gathering, history and learning to the Lil’wat Nation and the St’at’imc Nation,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Protecting it helps fulfil our land-use planning agreement commitments and makes sure that the forest will remain in place to protect their cultural values.”Pipi7iyekw (pronounced pippy yook) totals 864 hectares of old-growth forests and sensitive ecosystems within the Lillooet Timber Supply Area of the Cascades Natural Resource District. The protected designation ensures that the Lil’wat and St’at’imc Nations’ ongoing, traditional use of cultural heritage resources, such as gathering wild plants for food and botanical medicines, and culturally modified trees and artifact sites in the area, will remain unaffected by development.“Since time immemorial, the people of the Lil’wat Nation have depended on Pipi7iyekw for food, medicine, resources, teaching and to practice our culture, traditions and spirituality,” said Political Chief Dean Nelson, Lil’wat Nation. “Many people have used this area over the years and continue to. Our late Elder Morgan Wells would regularly gather plants here, so much so that it became a place known as Morgan’s Garden.\\xa0Pipi7iyekw is just one of many important places within our territory that Lil’wat people actively use. We’ve worked hard with the Province to protect this area and are proud of this collective achievement.”In 2008, the Province and Lil’wat Nation entered into a land-use planning agreement associated with the Sea-to-Sky Land and Resource Management Plan. The agreement includes a commitment for Lil’wat to identify up to 2,000 hectares of “old-growth forest and sensitive areas” within its territory for protection. With the establishment of Pipi7iyekw, more than two-thirds of the committed area has been established as protected area.“Last fall, we passed legislation to implement the United Nations’ Declaration, recognizing in law the human rights of Indigenous peoples,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “As stewards of the land since time immemorial, an important part of reconciliation is to work with Nations on decisions that affect their territories —\\xa0and as government, we make better decisions when we incorporate the wisdom and guidance that First Nations have to offer.”Pipi7iyekw’s legal designation removes 0.2% from the Lillooet Timber Supply Area’s timber harvesting land base —\\xa0the area where timber harvesting is legally and economically feasible. As a protected area, it will, in the long term:\\nmaintain representative examples of old-condition, forested stands in culturally and ecologically important areas;\\nmaintain habitat for old-growth-dependent species;\\nmaintain recruitment habitat for cultural cedar and other culturally important species; and\\nmaintain culturally and ecologically important ecosystems, including, but not limited to, riparian areas, red- and blue-listed species habitat, and traditional and cultural use sites.\\nExisting infrastructure, such as highways and associated buildings, is not affected. Exceptions on timber harvesting also remain to address forest health concerns, such as insect infestations or disease, and to remove safety hazards within road right-of-ways, recreation sites and trails.Learn More:Find out more about the Lil’wat Nation: https://lilwat.caThe minister’s order and a map of Pipi7iyekw is available: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/natural-resource-use/land-water-use/crown-land/land-use-plans-and-objectives/thompsonokanagan-region/lillooet-lrmp/lillooet_lrmp_luor_30jan2020.pdfInformation on Nlhaxten/Cerise Creek Conservancy is available: http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/cnsrvncy/nlhaxten-cerise-crk\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Providing 17 new housing options allows us to continue to support our Membership with affordable housing while working towards our long-term vision of revitalizing our community core.”In 2018, B.C. became the first province to invest in on-reserve housing for First Nations people through the Indigenous Housing Fund, a $550-million investment over 10 years to build and operate 1,750 new homes, both on- and off- reserve. These homes with the WFN are part of the first series of projects that were selected in November 2018 to receive funding through the Indigenous Housing Fund.“Housing is the foundation on which people build their lives. With these homes, more WFN Members will be able to stay in their home community, surrounded by their culture and tradition,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Our government is proud to be working in partnership with First Nations, Indigenous leaders and Indigenous housing providers to build much-needed new, affordable homes like these for Indigenous peoples throughout B.C.”The\\xa0first complex, a two-storey apartment building at 1920 Falcon Lane, will include 14 apartments for WFN Members.

They have seen the growth of B.C. wines from a small, unrecognized industry, to a strong and respected brand, enjoyed throughout our province, country and world.“BC VQA wines have a maturity well beyond their years, and have grown to include almost 300 wineries and 1,000 vineyards, creating jobs and supporting tourism in communities throughout the province. The B.C. government is proud to support the family-run vineyards and wineries that continue to produce award-winning wines in our province and partner with them to help market B.C. wine locally and internationally, as well as creating resources and programs to support winemaking and grape growing in B.C.“The sector has grown through the emergence of the BC VQA designation as a trusted symbol of quality and the hard work and dedication of the BC\\xa0Wine Institute. The institute has spent three decades introducing, explaining and sharing the B.C. wine experience with locals and visitors. From helping them learn about B.C. terroir and local food pairings, to exploring our designated wine regions, they have been tireless as advocates and champions of our province’s winemakers and wines. I want to acknowledge that and thank them for it.“In the last 30 years, we have enjoyed B.C. wine at meals and celebrations with family and friends. It is only fitting that as we celebrate this anniversary of VQA, we share a toast to the people who built winemaking in B.C. and those who continue to work in our award-winning wine industry.

AgriStability Enhancement Program means that up to an additional $9 million is available for qualifying farmers over the next two years.AgriStability is a national program providing protection to Canadian agricultural producers against large declines that threaten the viability of their farms and are beyond their capacity to manage. The B.C. AgriStability Enhancement Program is available to B.C. farmers who were enrolled in 2019 and those who enrol in 2020.“We are increasing the compensation rate from 70% to 80%, which means that every payment in 2019 and 2020 from AgriStability will be increased by 14.3%,”\\xa0Popham said. “Currently, farms with the widest margins receive the least support. We are eliminating the reference margin limit and that will address this problem.”B.C. farmers already participating in AgriStability will automatically receive the increased protection. Those who are not participating can still enrol for 2020.

The insurance product will be based on the per-kilometre distance travelled with passengers aboard and is equivalent to what is available for ride-hailing vehicles.“In the near future, taxi drivers who want this new product will be able to switch their insurance, with coverage beginning in the spring. Drivers who wish to keep their current form of coverage will not be affected.“Secondly, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is talking with representatives from the taxi industry and other stakeholders to determine how to ensure funds from the 30-cents-per-trip fee being charged on ride hailing will\\xa0help support a sustained and improved level of accessible vehicles on the road.“I want to thank all those who have been in contact with my office on these issues, particularly my colleagues in the legislative assembly who have been strong advocates for their constituents.“While efforts continue to ensure safety and fairness, I am proud that our government refused to back down against pressures to abandon our regulatory measures on ride hailing.

       "  \"\\n\\nPeople in communities throughout British Columbia will soon benefit from expanded composting facilities that will reduce the amount of organic material sent to B.C. landfills, create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\\xa0To ensure B.C. communities are clean and healthy places to live, the Province is partnering with the federal and local governments on the new Organics Infrastructure Program. The $30-million program will help communities expand their infrastructure, diverting organic waste away from landfills. It will also help the Province meet its CleanBC commitment to help communities achieve 95% organic waste diversion for agricultural, industrial and municipal waste.“This program will help communities, the Province and Canada meet our shared climate action goals,” said George Heyman, B.C.'s Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “It will also help build B.C.’s clean economy by creating green jobs and setting the stage for the economic opportunities that come from the reuse of organic materials.”\\xa0Organic waste currently represents 40% of material sent to municipal landfills in B.C. and generates 7.5% of the province's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In total, the projects are expected to reduce nearly 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over the next decade. This is like removing more than 100,000 cars from the roads for a year.“Investing in better infrastructure for waste management will divert organic waste from municipal landfills and turn it into clean and useful compost,” said Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “Initiatives such as this one are key to fighting climate change and helping us reach net-zero emissions by 2050. I congratulate the Province of British Columbia for its leadership in this effort.”The Organics Infrastructure Program combines $10 million in federal funding from the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund, $10 million from the Province and $10 million in matching funds from local government applicants and their partners. Among the projects are two from the Central Kootenay Regional District — Central landfill composting facility and the Creston landfill composting facility — that, together, provide the region with food-waste processing capacity for the first time. Another recipient is the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality’s worm composting facility. It will divert organic waste from Fort Nelson's landfill and create high-quality soil.“These new projects will improve organics diversion across the province,” said Maja Tait, president, Union of B.C. Municipalities. “The result will be reduced GHG emissions from landfills, moving the needle forward in the attainment of CleanBC goals. I am very appreciative of the continuing support provided by the federal and provincial governments to expand organics infrastructure in B.C. communities.”Twelve projects have finalized agreements to date. Additional projects are expected to come on board in the coming months. The initial projects are expected to break ground starting in the spring.CleanBC is\\xa0the province's\\xa0pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future.

The grants are being allocated as follows:\\n$408,320\\xa0to Skeena\\xa0Bioenergy Ltd. to use material from slash piles to make wood pellets (about 22,000 cubic metres or 440 truckloads) in the Coast Mountains Natural Resource District.\\n$1,080,000 to Taan Forest Products to use material from slash piles to make pulp for use in paper products (about 51,000 cubic metres or 1,020 truckloads) in the Haida Gwaii Natural Resource District.\\n$880,000 to Skookumchuck Pulp Inc. to use material from slash piles to make pulp for use in paper products (about 110,000 cubic metres or 2,200 truckloads) in the Rocky Mountain Natural Resource District.\\n$369,450\\xa0to RPP Holdings Inc. to use material from slash piles to make pulp for use in paper products (about 36,000 cubic metres or 720 truckloads) in the Quesnel Natural Resource District.\\nAs of Jan. 30, 2020, the Forest Enhancement Society of BC has supported 250 projects valued at $233 million, in partnership with the B.C. government and the Government of Canada.“As I’ve travelled around the province, I’ve seen first-hand how these grants from the Forest Enhancement Society of BC are making a difference in our communities,” said Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “It’s encouraging to see wood debris diverted from slash piles and used to make value-added products instead.”Projects funded by the Forest Enhancement Society of BC help minimize wildfire risks, enhance wildlife habitat, improve low-value and damaged forests, re-plant damaged forests and utilize fibre for green energy production. Many of these projects also result in carbon benefits and contribute to climate change mitigation.“Assisting\\xa0the Province to reduce greenhouse gases, add value to forest fibre and maintain jobs for workers and communities are some of our key objectives,” said Wayne Clogg, board chair, Forest Enhancement Society of BC. “There are many society-funded projects throughout B.C. that are making a difference right now. The amount of biomass (woody debris) that will not be burned as slash — but instead used this winter season to fuel a greener economy — is expected to exceed 1.6 million cubic metres by March 2020. Funding has been committed to continue some of these projects to 2022 to further help forest workers and communities who are most in need.”Quick Facts:\\nThe Forest Enhancement Society of BC is a Crown agency. It was established in 2016 to advance the environmental and resource stewardship of the province’s forests by:\\npreventing wildfires and mitigating wildfire impacts;\\nimproving damaged or low-value forests;\\nimproving wildlife habitat;\\nsupporting the use of fibre from damaged or low-value forests; and\\ntreating forests to improve the management of greenhouse gases.\\n\\nThe B.C. government has invested $235 million in the Forest Enhancement Society of BC, which has supported 250 projects to date related to wildfire risk reduction, reforestation, forest rehabilitation, wildlife habitat restoration and raising awareness of the FireSmart program.\\nThe Forest Enhancement Society of BC is a partner in the Forest Carbon Initiative, which is funded in part through the federal government’s Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund.

As well as the new classrooms, the expansion will add accessible washrooms and storage space to the school.“As a district, we recognize the importance of child care to families in Burnaby and have been a leader for more than 35 years in enabling space in our schools and on our properties,” said Gary Wong, chair, Burnaby Board of Education. “We are grateful for our partnerships with the provincial government and the City of Burnaby, as well as those we have in the community. This helps us to support families with child care and also to give students the classroom learning environment and space they need to thrive.”Government is working to add new student spaces in fast-growing communities to reduce the need for portables and provide permanent spaces for students. Since September 2017, the Province has announced nearly $650 million for new and expanded schools that are bringing almost 11,000 new student seats to schools throughout B.C.“These new classrooms and child care spaces are giving more children the best chance to learn and thrive in Burnaby,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “They are a great example of the investments we’re making to build and expand schools in fast-growing communities throughout B.C.”In addition to the new child care spaces at University Highlands, the SFU Childcare Society\\xa0is receiving funding through the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund to renovate an existing facility at 8888 University Dr. and create 12 new infant/toddler spaces, taking the total number of infant/toddler spaces at this location to 61. These new spaces are expected to open in March 2020 and add to the 311 licensed child care spaces for children under the age of 12 currently offered by the society.“Inspired by the infant/toddler preschools of Reggio Emilia, Italy, the SFU Childcare Society values children, educators, families and the natural environment for the contributions they all bring to the space in which we live in community with one another,” said Rachel Day, executive director,\\xa0SFU Childcare Society. “Through our mission of ‘leading excellence in early care and learning in a sustainable way,’ we consider ways in which we can shift from ‘thoughts of quality’ to creating conditions and values in which quality thrives.”With these new spaces, the Province has funded more than 300 new, affordable licensed child care spaces in Burnaby since the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund launched in July 2018. They are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history, with more than 10,400 funded in the past 18 months.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nThe City of Burnaby is receiving a $25,000 grant through the Union of British Columbia Municipalities’ Community Child Care Planning Grant Program to help create a long-term child care plan to support families in the community.\\nSince launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in Burnaby save more than $18.3 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.\\nThe Province has invested more than $13 million to provide more than 10,000 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, with another $1-per-hour lift coming in April 2020. This includes almost $775,000 for early childhood educators in Burnaby.\\nLearn More:For more information about the Burnaby School District, visit: www.burnabyschools.caFor more information about child care at Simon Fraser University, visit: http://www.sfu.ca/childcare.htmlFor more about Childcare BC, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/childcareFor more information on child care in Burnaby, visit Burnaby/New Westminster Child Care Resource and Referral:\\nhttps://gv.ymca.ca/Locations/Burnaby/Marlborough/Burnaby-New-Westminster-Child-Care-Resource-Refe\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nTechnical\\xa0excellence and innovation were honoured at the 2020 B.C. Highways Consulting Engineers Awards on Jan. 28, 2020, in Vancouver.The categories for this year’s awards included design and contract preparation for roads, design and contract preparation for structures, construction management and supervision services, specialized engineering services and alternate transportation.Design and contract preparation – roadsThe winner in this category is ISL Engineering and Land Services for its work on the North Fork Bridge Replacement and Four-Laning project on the Trans-Canada Highway, approximately 28 kilometres east of Sicamous. The old North Fork Bridge was built in 1958 and was the last remaining metal-truss bridge along Highway 1. ISL worked with a ministry structural engineering team to replace the two-lane narrow steel truss bridge with a new, 66-metre, four-lane concrete bridge.ISL came up with a creative design to allow construction of a westbound structure while traffic remained on the existing bridge. This allowed an eastbound structure to be constructed after traffic shifted to the newly built bridge. The project also included 1.7 kilometres of new frontage roads and two new protected T-intersections. This work boosts capacity and safety for people travelling along this corridor.Design and contract preparation – structuresThe top honour in this category went to Stantec Consulting Ltd. for its work on the Nass River Bridge Replacement on Highway 37, approximately 76 kilometres east of Stewart. This project demonstrated engineering excellence with the construction of a new two-lane, approximately 130-metre bridge to span the Nass River. This replaced the former single-lane bridge.The new bridge meets modern design criteria for heavy industry routes, set to accommodate large transport trucks. The design had to consider the remote northern location of the bridge in conjunction with the shortened construction season and logistics when rocky terrain and varying rock quality posed challenges.Construction management and supervision servicesThe award in this category went to WSP Canada Inc. for extraordinary construction supervision on the Highway 1 Mountain Highway Interchange project in North Vancouver. The project includes a new, improved alignment and the construction of a full interchange two\\xa0kilometres north of the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge, which will significantly shorten commute times and improve safety for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists on the North Shore.\\xa0As crews worked on this project, the Mountain Highway Interchange was constrained by steep terrain and tight work spaces. WSP was instrumental in ensuring the contractor managed its work efficiently and safely. WSP did an excellent job monitoring the operation and safety of traffic management plans, detour plans, temporary pedestrian and cycling connections, intersection operations and lane closures.Specialized engineering servicesThe top honour in this category went to R. F. Binnie & Associates Ltd. for the Alex Fraser Bridge Capacity Improvement project on Highway 91 in Delta. This project involved adding a seventh lane to the bridge, along with a moveable barrier system and a zipper truck, which is being used to create counterflow for traffic during peak times.Binnie’s quality management processes provided an efficient and seamless transition from project development, through design and into construction. The new zipper system is unique to Western Canada. It is making a difference for the almost 120,000 people who drive across the Alex Fraser Bridge every day.Alternate transportationThe recipient of this award is AECOM Canada Ltd. for the Commercial Broadway SkyTrain upgrade in Vancouver. This is Canada’s first dual platform transit station within Metro Vancouver’s busiest transit hub, with approximately 150,000 commuters on a typical weekday.AECOM’s station design includes universal fare gates, two new elevators, four new escalators, wayfinding tiles and handrail upgrades to ensure a safe and convenient station for people with accessibility challenges. This project represented several engineering firsts for TransLink and a significant investment in this busy transit hub. The upgrades serve\\xa0transit riders daily\\xa0and enhance\\xa0capacity, safety, efficiency and accessibility for this key interchange station.Learn More:2020 B.C.

       "  '\\n\\nGovernment is making changes to help ensure that ICBC is more transparent and accountable to its customers.The purpose is to give British Columbians greater confidence that the corporation is treating them fairly when challenges arise, while better supporting people injured in crashes.Government will be taking steps to appoint a new fairness office – focused on customer fairness – that is more independent from ICBC. The office will be required to report out publicly, in plain language, on the type and number of issues it hears, along with recommendations to ICBC. ICBC will also be required to report publicly on actions it takes to respond to these recommendations.“British Columbians should have the peace of mind that they will be treated fairly after they’ve been injured in a crash,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “With this change, British Columbians can have confidence that the fairness office has greater independence from ICBC and has the impartial authority to review the fairness of their situation with the ability to make recommendations to ICBC.”The fairness office will be appointed by cabinet and be independent from ICBC’s claims arm. This office will review and make recommendations to ICBC to resolve individual customer complaints, as well as policy and process, related to customer fairness. The new office will be in place by spring 2021.The fairness office does not overlap with the role of the ombudsperson, who continues to have independent authority to resolve ICBC issues.The Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) will continue to resolve disputes for ICBC claims of $50,000 and under, separate from the courts and independent of ICBC. When there is a disagreement between the customer and ICBC on certain decisions made by ICBC (e.g., matters involving minor injury determinations, accident benefit entitlement and fault determinations or claimed amounts $50,000 and under) the matter will be decided by the CRT, rather than the fairness office.“Each of our three million customers should have confidence in knowing that they’ll be treated fairly when they deal with us, and we welcome the fairness office to assist in that regard,” said Nicolas Jimenez, president and CEO, ICBC. “British Columbians must also have the opportunity to tell us directly about how ICBC can be improved, and I believe today’s changes will give our customers confidence in knowing that when they speak up, ICBC will be listening and accountable to them.”Additional reforms to improve how ICBC is accountable to its customers will include:\\na requirement to produce a customer-friendly summary of its annual report directly to its customers and in plain language, so that people can see how their premium dollars are spent;\\nenhancing ICBC’s existing customer panel to provide more British Columbians a greater opportunity to offer input on a wider range of topics, including future changes at the corporation; and\\nimproving online services for booking road tests.\\nAnother change that will be made by government to build trust and better support people who have been injured in a motor vehicle accident is pre-litigation payments. For those who are injured and qualify, ICBC will be offering pre-litigation payments up front without the need to waive the ability to sue if they so choose. Previously, if a person decided to take ICBC’s settlement, they had to agree to not seek additional settlement money through the courts.The intent of this program is to help injured customers receive full and fair compensation as quickly as possible. It will also help those injured keep more of their settlement, instead of paying it to lawyer and legal fees, which can total as much as 33% of the total settlement and can require a lengthy court process.The ability for ICBC to offer pre-litigation payments will take effect as of Jan. 29, 2020, and will be formalized through legislation in spring 2020. The new fairness office will be formalized in legislation in fall 2020. Government will monitor all of the aforementioned changes to ensure ICBC continues to be accountable to its customers and all British Columbians.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

When the upgrades are complete, parents will benefit from the comfort of knowing their children will be learning in a seismically safe school.“We are pleased to be closer in ensuring all our students are in seismically safe schools,” said Janet Fraser, chair of the Vancouver School Board. “We’re grateful for ministry funding to upgrade Livingstone Elementary.”Suzanne Hoffman, superintendent, Vancouver School Board, said, “We want to move our students into seismically safe schools as quickly as possible. This announcement brings us one step closer to ensuring current and future Livingstone students will be in an upgraded school in the event of an earthquake.”This investment is part of the Province’s work to accelerate the Seismic Mitigation Program and provide safe spaces for students throughout B.C. as soon as possible.Since September 2017, the Province has announced $900 million for seismic upgrades or replacements, giving nearly 25,000 B.C. students a seismically safe school. This includes $289 million to upgrade or replace 11 schools in Vancouver, for a total of over 6,500 safe seats.To continue this momentum, Budget 2019 includes a record $791 million over three years for seismic upgrades throughout B.C.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

We are seeing an increase in the amount of local food served in B.C.’s hospitals and care facilities already, and we are just getting started.”To help B.C. farmers and processors navigate the complex food supply system and sell their products to provincial government facilities, the ministry is providing much-needed information and guidance, including on-farm food-safety training, new technology and business advice. To date, over 200 B.C. food and agriculture businesses have participated in business-development related training offered through Feed BC, building their capacity and readiness to sell to public facilities.“I am proud to recognize Fraser Health and other health authorities, including Interior Health, which has led the way in offering B.C.-grown produce and foods in its facilities,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “It’s a big shift, and it has adapted and developed excellent strategies to prioritize B.C. in food services.”Fraser Health delivers a wide range of health-care services to more than 1.8 million people living in communities stretching from Burnaby to Hope and operates 12 acute care hospitals and a number of long-term care facilities.\\xa0While procuring B.C. foods is a priority for health authorities, protecting the health and safety of vulnerable patients is paramount. All food products, including B.C. produced and processed foods, must comply with the highest standards for food safety, nutrition, allergens and traceability.Quotes:Parm Bains, president and CEO, Westberry Farms – “As a farmer in B.C., Feed BC is opening new lines of business that will boost sales and get local food to more people around the province. This opportunity means a lot to the industry and I am looking forward to watching its continued success.”Dr. Victoria Lee, president and CEO, Fraser Health –“We’re excited to partner with the B.C. government and local producers to provide more fresh and local food to our patients and residents. Good nutrition plays a fundamental part of a person’s health, well-being and recovery and is complimentary to the care we provide.”Lisa Beare, MLA for Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows – “Feed BC is creating more opportunities for the region’s farmers and helping grow the local economy. An initiative like this really pulls the community together to help bring more B.C. food to patients and residents in Fraser Health facilities.”Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission –“Farmers and processors in B.C. now have the government support needed to help them get their products to patients and residents in hospitals and long-term care facilities like Fraser Health, helping connect the community to B.C.’s agriculture industry and the people who grow their food.” \\xa0\\xa0Quick Facts:\\nInterior Health was first to introduce Feed BC in its health-care facilities and received support to implement strategies to increase its purchase of local foods starting in 2019.\\nHealth authorities have found success in purchasing and using more B.C. food by introducing more local and seasonal fruit, vegetables and salads; offering a wider variety of local baked goods and sandwich options; and making more items from scratch when possible.\\nIn 2018, B.C.’s agriculture, seafood and food-processing sectors hit record revenues of $15 billion.\\nB.C. food consumption accounted for $6.5 billion, showing strong local support for B.C. food products.\\n\\nMore than 2,000 new jobs were created in 2017, bringing the total number of people working in B.C.’s agriculture industry in 2018 to more than 63,000.\\nIn 2018, B.C. food product\\xa0sales reached $4.5 billion in international exports and more than $6 billion domestically.\\nLearn More:Visit the Feed BC website: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/growbc-feedbc-buybc/feed-bcCheck out the Selling B.C.

Participants will build skills while co-ordinating pilot projects in classrooms and public events that encourage biking in Nakusp, Kamloops and Nanaimo. They will also explore opportunities for bringing adaptive biking to B.C. resorts.The funding will provide six job seekers with experience in community engagement, event planning, marketing, bookkeeping, administration, bike mechanics and coaching. This will increase their opportunities for sustainable employment.“Organizations like KASA have brought inclusion to the forefront and are building a culture where people with disabilities can more fully enjoy their community,” said Katrine Conroy, MLA for Kootenay West. “I’m proud of the people in our region for making the Kootenays more welcoming and inclusive.”The project will focus on hiring Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, youth and multi-barriered people.

The company will provide on-demand, immediate counselling and referral support to almost half a million students in B.C.’s public and private post-secondary institutions.\\xa0“Mental health\\xa0is\\xa0an\\xa0issue\\xa0our government takes seriously,”\\xa0said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Post-secondary students have told me there is a gap in mental heath support services.

As this provincewide program is a new service, the ministry will take the time to engage with students and post-secondary institutions on the design of the service before launch in spring 2020.“Many students don’t come forward and ask for the help they need because of the stigma that still surrounds mental health issues,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “This service will meet young people where they are at and provide\\xa0them immediate access to someone to talk to, without shame or judgement.”\\xa0Morneau Shepell administers the largest clinical network in Canada.

The school district has also secured a school site for a new elementary school in the South Newton neighbourhood. These land purchases are in addition to the land that was purchased for an elementary school in Sunnyside Heights last year.\\xa0The site purchases are part of the collaborative, ongoing work by the Province, the Surrey School District and the City of Surrey, with a common goal to find new ways to accelerate the pace of school construction for Surrey students and families. The three parties met on Jan. 28, 2020, at the fifth Surrey Schools Summit to continue that work.New schools will be needed soon in Redwood Heights, South Newton and Sunnyside to accommodate new and existing developments that are adding thousands of new families to the communities.“Today’s announcement of new school sites for Surrey lines up with the Smart Development initiative my council colleagues and I have put in place for our city,” said Doug McCallum, mayor of Surrey. “It’s no secret that for far too long, developments in Surrey were being approved without the essential infrastructure, such as schools, needed to support a new community. With Smart Development, the City of Surrey has purchased property for parkland use that will complement the new school and any future development in the Redwood Heights neighbourhood.”Smart Development is at the centre of the City of Surrey’s long- and short-range development planning that focuses on offering residents diverse housing options near essential infrastructure, such as schools and parks. It also prioritizes the conservation of sensitive ecosystems, while ensuring that Surrey continues to advance as one of Canada’s most liveable cities, with safe routes for walking, cycling and recreation.Since September 2017, the Province has announced $270.5 million for new and expanded schools, seismic upgrades, and land purchases for future schools in Surrey. This is helping to add nearly 7,500 new student seats in Surrey between 2018 and September 2022.The district has also been supported to develop business cases for more expansion projects that are expected to add an estimated 2,000 additional student seats to fast-growing communities in Surrey.\\xa0“The Surrey School District is the largest and fastest-growing district in the province. Our student population has been steadily increasing every year,” said Laurie Larsen, chair, Surrey Board of Education. “We currently have almost 74,000 students, and we’re projecting an additional 1,000 students for the next school year. This type of growth requires strong partnerships with all levels of government. I am so proud of the collaborative relationship we have with the Ministry of Education and the City of Surrey. Together, we are addressing the growth our community is experiencing and finding sustainable solutions that work for parents and students.”Government is making record investments in B.C. schools to give every student the best learning experience possible. In two and a half years, the Province has approved nearly $1.8 billion in school capital investments, creating almost 11,000 new student seats and 24,000 seismically safe seats.To continue this momentum, Budget 2019 includes a historic $2.7 billion for school capital investments over three years.A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The rights will be for 25 parcels of land, totalling about 6,800 hectares, in the mature Clarke Lake gas field near the community of Fort Nelson in the northeast corner of the province. With tenure secured, Deh Tai can apply to the BC Oil and Gas Commission for well authorizations to conduct exploratory drilling to assess geothermal potential.\\xa0\\xa0Under CleanBC, the Province is working in collaboration with Indigenous peoples to seize new clean energy and economic development opportunities.“With the Clark Lake Geothermal Project, Fort Nelson First Nation is proudly demonstrating Indigenous leadership that will help pave the way for Western Canada’s transition toward a cleaner and more energy secure future,” said Chief Sharleen Gale, Fort Nelson First Nation. “We look forward to continuing to work with our federal and provincial partners to make this project a model success that benefits our community members and the surrounding territory.”The Province and BC Hydro are encouraged by the potential of geothermal to add to British Columbia’s mix of energy resources, particularly in remote areas of northeast B.C. where past exploration activities have reduced the risks and costs associated with drilling and gathering critical temperature and reservoir data required to advance geothermal projects. Unlike wind, solar and run-of-river projects, which are intermittent, geothermal is a firm, reliable source of generation providing electrical capacity whenever it is needed.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future.

The outcome is that some fares will increase, though new routes have been created with lower fares. Fare updates will be made available on the BC Bus North website on Friday, Jan. 31, 2020.“When Greyhound stopped its service in the North, we didn’t want to leave people without a reliable and affordable transportation option,” said Claire Trevena, B.C. Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “That’s why we started BC Bus North and why we’re now partnering with the federal government to continue to fund B.C.’s northern inter-city bus service through March 2021.”The Province will continue to closely monitor the BC Bus North service to better understand the demand for inter-city transportation. A BC Bus North travellers’ survey will be conducted in the spring.Quick Facts: \\nBC Bus North offers four routes, between Prince George and Prince Rupert, Valemount and Prince George, Prince George and Fort St. John, and Dawson Creek and Fort Nelson.\\nBC Bus North covers nearly 7,000 kilometres every week, or about 28,000 kilometres per month.\\nBC Bus North has provided rides for almost 9,000 people since the service was launched in 2018.\\nLearn More: For more information on BC Bus North, including schedules and fares, visit: https://bcbus.ca/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe\\xa0Province is proposing more residential flexibility for people living in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) as outlined in a new policy intentions paper released Jan. 27, 2020, by the Ministry of Agriculture.In order to support farmers and non-farmers living in the ALR, government is considering regulatory changes to enable landowners to have both a principal residence and a small secondary residence on their property, provided they have approval from their local government. ALR property owners would not be required to apply to the Agricultural Land Commission (ALC) for approval.“We are continuing to do the work necessary to help farmers farm and protect farmland for future generations,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture.\\xa0“The ALR is B.C.’s best food-producing land, and is just 5% of our province’s land base – it’s so important for food security. The proposed changes, if implemented, would provide additional residential flexibility in the ALR. Publicly sharing this proposed policy direction now gives those interested an opportunity to review and comment, leading to better outcomes. We recognize that rules by the previous government do not reflect the needs of British Columbians and as a result, we are proposing to allow more flexibility for small secondary residences. Under the proposal, a small secondary residence would be available for farm-workers, family members or anyone else, provided there is local government approval.”The new ALR residential options and specific conditions with each option such as size, siting, and quantity being considered by government include:\\ngarden suites, guest houses or carriage suites;\\naccommodation above an existing building;\\nmanufactured homes; and\\npermitting a principal residence to be constructed in addition to a manufactured home that was formerly a principal residence.\\nThe Province would not require the small secondary residence be a manufactured home only for an immediate family member, as was the case in regulations under the previous government. The new residential options do not include reconsideration of the maximum size of a principal residence. The ALC will remain the decision maker for additional residences for farm use in the ALR. Any new permitted secondary residences should be registered with the ALC for long-term land-use planning purposes.The policy intentions paper resulted from collaborative work with the Union of B.C. Municipalities, the ALC and the BC Agriculture Council, and responds to feedback the ministry heard during recent public consultations. The policy direction is also guided by the results of the Minister of Agriculture’s Advisory Committee on ALR Revitalization. People are asked to provide their feedback by April 17, 2020, on the residential options via email: ALR_ALCRevitalization@gov.bc.caWhile the ministry finalizes its policy direction, the grandfathering period for manufactured homes in the ALR for immediate family members has been extended to Dec. 31, 2020. This means people wishing to place manufactured homes on their ALR property will be required to get the necessary permits and authorizations from their local governments, but do not have to apply to the ALC for approval.Quotes:Jill Azanza of K & M Farms in Abbotsford – “Farmers need farmland to farm. Farmers that are growing and looking to the future support measures like these. This change will help young and new farmers get established on the land, and help retiring farmers stay on the farm.”Maja Tait, president, Union of B.C. Municipalities – “Local governments support greater flexibility for residential arrangements that support farming on ALR land. I appreciate the work the Ministry of Agriculture has undertaken on this issue in consultation with local government and others. This next phase will provide an opportunity to refine the concepts developed, and I encourage local governments to provide input to the ministry\\'s process.”Fred Haynes, mayor, District of Saanich – \"This proposed change would benefit Saanich residents who live or farm in the ALR because it creates more options for residences, while maintaining strong protections for farmland.”Jennifer Dyson, chair, Agricultural Land Commission – “This approach by the Province helps the ALC be less reactive and more focused on proactively seeking opportunities to improve agricultural land utilization, encourage farming and address emerging and strategic issues.”Quick Facts:\\nDuring the 2019 public engagement, 613 British Columbians registered to participate in the eight in-person sessions.\\nThe ministry received 1,580 online survey submissions, 87 personal submissions and 19 formal submissions from associations, farmers’ institutes and local governments.\\nFarmers have always had the option to build additional residences in the ALR (two, three or more), provided they are needed for farming and have approval from the local government and the ALC.\\nThe primary use of ALR land is agriculture, therefore additional residences must minimize disturbance to farm land.\\nLearn More:Read the Ministry of Agriculture Policy Intentions Paper: Residential Flexibility in the ALR: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/agriculture-and-seafood/agricultural-land-and-environment/agriculture-land-reserve/residential_flexibility_intentions_paper.pdfRead the What We Heard report from the 2019 public engagement: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/govtogetherbc/impact/supporting-b-c-farmers-results/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Installation of the bridge was quicker than expected because bedrock was deeper than expected. This allowed for the bridge to be inset into the road grade, rather than above it, which would have required a substantial amount of approach ramp work. Construction time was also reduced by bringing in additional bridge crews and equipment. \\xa0All vehicles are now able to safely travel the corridor, which remains under single lane alternating traffic conditions through the project site. Drivers should expect delays through the night and morning.The regular project closure schedule will resume Sunday night to allow construction to continue on the project.

The system will be able to monitor each hive’s honey yield and provide insight into superior breeding stock of male and queen bees, hive diseases and the impact of environmental variables, such as climate and weather on each hive. The results of this project will help beekeepers better care for their hives and improve honey yield.Similarly, an innovation project submitted by the BC Cranberry Marketing Commission (BCCMC) was selected to receive $10,725 to support a study on pollination across different varieties of cranberries. Researchers are looking into how to increase cranberry yield through artificial pollination. They will monitor how often pollinators visit different varieties of plants during peak bloom, which will help growers plan for future seasons.These projects are examples of the innovative ideas that B.C.-based organizations are working on to build a more sustainable future for agriculture in British Columbia.

       "  '\\n\\nHighway 4 at Kennedy Hill will close at 8 p.m. today, Jan. 24, for overnight foundation work in preparation for weekend bridge installation.When the bridge is in place, the highway will be reopened to single-lane alternating traffic, allowing commercial vehicles, RVs and other larger vehicles to move through the corridor.Prior to bridge installation, there will be a limited opening of the highway on Saturday, Jan. 25, between 8 a.m. and noon for passenger vehicles and light pickups only.Once these smaller vehicles have cleared at noon, Saturday, work will begin on placement of a pre-fabricated 20-metre single-lane bridge at the site. A specialized bridge crew will be working day and night to complete the install. Work will be challenging as the bridge is being placed in a narrow space between the rock bluff and Kennedy Lake.The goal is to have Highway 4 reopened to single-lane alternating traffic to regular and commercial vehicles on Sunday afternoon, Jan. 26. The ministry, along with its contractor on site, is completing a comprehensive work plan to expedite the works as safely as possible. The ministry will update the estimated closure duration as bridge installation progresses, with updates posted to DriveBC and the contractor’s Facebook project page.For Saturday morning’s limited opening, vehicles will be screened at the Tofino/Ucluelet junction and at Sproat Lake and larger vehicles will wide be turned around. Heavy loads, commercial trucks and vehicles with campers or towing trailers will not be let through. Drivers need to obey the instructions of traffic control personnel.For motorists affected by the Highway 4 closure, two Emergency Support Hubs are available in Pacific Rim National Park. Combers Beach parking lot is available for semi-trailer trucks, and Green Point Campground overflow is available for RVs and campers.The damage to Highway 4 was caused by an unexpectedly large volume of rock falling on rain-saturated ground during a scheduled blast early on Thursday, Jan. 23, as part of the Highway 4 - Kennedy Hill Safety Improvement project. The highway was closed to traffic at the time of the blast.The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure thanks area residents and other people who rely on the highway for their patience and understanding.When completed later in 2020, the Highway 4 - Kennedy Hill Safety Improvement Project will create a safer and more reliable connection between Port Alberni and the west coast of Vancouver Island.Call 1 855 451-7152 to listen to the travel information hotline message, updated daily during construction.Learn More:General project information and traffic schedules is available: www.gov.bc.ca/highway4kennedyhillVisit the project page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eac.bc.ca.kennedy.hill/Follow @DriveBC and #BCHwy4 on Twitter or visit: www.drivebc.caFor more information on the Emergency Support Hubs for commercial truck drivers and RVs and campers, contact Pacific Rim National Park Reserve at 250 726-3524.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The school will open in 2022, with a total capacity for 505 students. The New Westminster School District is providing $1 million toward the replacement.“Our government acted fast to bring this school to local families, so their children could go to school in a safe building that gives them the best opportunity to thrive,” said Judy Darcy, MLA for New Westminster. “This is what we’ve been waiting for in New Westminster, and I can’t wait to see students walking through the doors of what will be an amazing new school and a true hub in New Westminster.”To further benefit local families, the new school will also feature space for StrongStart and before and after school care programs, as well as a neighbourhood learning centre,\\xa0where additional childcare spaces will be a priority.“The board is very excited to award Heatherbrae Builders the contract to build the Richard McBride replacement school,” said Anita Ansari, chair of the New Westminster Board of Education. “The design proposed is innovative, focused on accessibility and grounded in the natural geography of the area. We are so pleased that the design plans on paper will now become a reality for our students in the Sapperton neighbourhood, with the generous funding provided by the Province and City of New Westminster. Our future Richard McBride students will have a place they love to learn, in a seismically sound, inclusive and energizing environment, and we're happy to begin the work to get them there.”This investment is part of the government’s work to improve schools for students throughout B.C.Since September 2017, the Province has announced nearly $1.8 billion for 79 school capital investments, including\\xa0new and expanded schools, seismic upgrades and replacements, and land purchases for future schools.\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nMany students throughout the province will commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz with age-appropriate lessons about how, where, what and why the Holocaust happened, including survivors’ personal stories.Every year on Jan. 27, Jewish communities around the globe observe International Holocaust Remembrance Day by holding vigils, discussions, film screenings and more.International Holocaust Remembrance Day commemorates the six million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust. Victims of Nazism included half of the world’s Jewish population, people who were Roma, disabled and LGBTQ2+, as well as political dissenters. \\xa0“While the horrors of the Holocaust happened more than 75 years ago, with recent and troubling anti-Semitic incidents, harassment and hate crimes, these lessons are as important today as they were then,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “It’s critical our kids understand the role indifference and apathy played in these atrocities, and how they can use their voices to speak out against injustices they encounter in their own lives.”Teachers are encouraged to share a new video resource with students 14 and older. “Leo’s Journey – In My Father’s Words” recounts 15-year-old Leopold Lowy’s struggle to survive the Mengele twin experiments at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Richard Lowy, Leopold’s son, brings this story to life with a word-for-word recital based on interviews recorded before his father’s death in 2002.“Though heartbreaking, the horrific implications of my father\\'s story is truly a gift,” said Lowy, who produced the video in Vancouver. “The burden is now all of ours. How we choose to incorporate this profound understanding into our lives is up to us.”Rita Akselrod, a Holocaust survivor and human rights activist, said, “Although it’s sad that Richard should have to tell his father’s story, it has such an important message. I just want the students to listen and understand they can make the world a better place.”The Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre (VHEC) offers age-appropriate school programs and resources designed for the B.C. curriculum, to teach\\xa0youth about the Holocaust and challenge\\xa0them to become committed global citizens, aware of discrimination, racism and genocide in today’s world. As Western Canada’s leading Holocaust teaching museum, the VHEC reaches more than 25,000 students and teachers annually in British Columbia and beyond. \\xa0Students in B.C. begin learning about the Holocaust in both history and social studies courses in Grade 6. They learn about other discriminatory policies and injustices in Canada and the world, with a focus on analyzing what happened in the past to prevent similar human rights abuses in the future. Students benefit from a new curriculum that weaves social responsibility throughout all grades to ensure every child learns respect for others.Quotes:Phil Levinson, president, Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre –“Engaging with eyewitness testimony is a uniquely powerful way to learn about the Holocaust and its lessons for present day. The story of our former VHEC board member and speaker, Leo Lowy, is a compelling entry point for teachers and students on this 75th anniversary.”Teri Mooring, president, British Columbia Teachers’ Federation –“With fewer survivors of the Holocaust still alive to tell their stories, it’s critical we pass on the lessons of the Holocaust to future generations to ensure it never happens again. These are difficult conversations, but education is the most powerful tool we have to combat hate.”Learn More:\\n\\n\"Leo’s Journey – In My Father’s Words,\" a video and information (recommended for students in grades 8 to 12):\\xa0https://leosjourney.caVHEC educational resources:\\xa0https://www.vhec.org/educational-resources/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

As a government, we are committed to working with our partners to build homes and create opportunities for women and children to thrive.”Calisto Place, located in New Westminster’s Queensborough neighbourhood, is operated by Women in Need Gaining Strength (WINGS), a non-profit charitable organization providing housing, programs and support for at-risk women and children. The five-unit townhouse complex was designed for smaller single-parent families. It has play areas for children and access to parks, schools, transit and other community amenities. Each of the new townhomes includes two bedrooms, a kitchen, living and dining rooms, and a three-piece bathroom.“Working together we are making a difference for families in our community,” said Judy Grams, board chair, WINGS. “Two years ago, the idea of building five units of affordable housing for women and children was only a dream. Now it is a reality. It has been a pleasure to join with the City of New Westminster and BC Housing on this project.”The Province provided a $600,000 grant and construction financing of $418,000 for the five townhomes. The City of New Westminster provided the land and covered municipal costs related to development and permit fees. Baptist Housing provided a $100,000 bond for the project, as well as free consulting.“The opening of the new affordable townhouse units in our Queensborough neighbourhood is another significant accomplishment in the City of New Westminster’s commitment to provide affordable housing options that meet the needs of our diverse community,” said Jonathan X. Coté, mayor, City of New Westminster. “I am proud that by working in partnership with BC Housing and WINGS, we have been able to provide a safe and welcoming place for single women and their children to live.”The project was completed in September 2019 and will be fully occupied by the end of the month. Rent is $900 per month for each townhome.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/To learn more about WINGS and the programs it provides, visit http://monarchplace.org/A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nJanuary 22, 2020 – Victoria, BCToday, federal, provincial and territorial (FPT) ministers responsible for justice and public safety concluded a one-day meeting to discuss key priorities of Canadians.With several new federal and provincial government mandates, this meeting was an opportunity to build upon relationships and outline key priorities of the different jurisdictions, such as Indigenous justice issues, restorative justice, medical assistance in dying, conversion therapy, rural crime, firearms, money laundering, cannabis enforcement, human trafficking, and online child sexual exploitation.Ministers acknowledged the Calls for Justice contained in the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Ministers will continue their collaboration to reduce violence against, and victimization of, Indigenous women, girls, and LGBTQ2S persons. \\xa0Ministers also recognized that, in partnership with Indigenous Peoples, all governments have a responsibility to address overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in the justice system as both victims and offenders.Ministers reiterated their commitment to building safer and healthier communities through the expanded use of restorative justice in the criminal justice system – an approach that seeks to repair harm and provide accountability – where and as appropriate. In 2018, ministers underscored the importance of restorative justice in addressing repeat offences and overrepresentation of Indigenous and vulnerable populations in the criminal justice system. At the time, they also committed to a goal of a 5% increase in the use of restorative justice, where possible, by 2021. With this in mind, ministers agreed to release a summary report identifying our country\\'s existing restorative justice programs and agencies, referrals made, and concrete steps jurisdictions have taken to increase the use of restorative justice.In light of the recent Québec Superior Court ruling on medical assistance in dying, ministers discussed the challenges of, and possible responses to, this difficult, personal, and complex issue. Ministers also affirmed their commitment to high quality hospice or palliative care. Following an update on its ongoing consultations with Canadians, the federal government reiterated its commitment to amend its medical assistance in dying legislation. Ministers affirmed their commitment to protecting vulnerable individuals and the equality rights of all Canadians.Ministers discussed the dangerous and harmful practice of conversion therapy and support was expressed for legislative and other measures to ban this practice, including the federal government\\'s intention to introduce amendments to the\\xa0Criminal Code. \\xa0\\xa0Ministers underscored the impact of rural crime and ways to reduce it, including criminal law reform and enhanced police response, so all Canadians, no matter where they live, feel safe, secure, and protected in their communities. Ministers agreed to examine the problem closely and revisit it at the next FPT meeting later this year.Ministers were also provided with an update on federal measures to reduce gun and gang-related violence across Canada, and discussed related issues such as drug trafficking, illegal gun sales and smuggling, and border security. As part of this conversation, they acknowledged the importance of treating law-abiding firearm owners fairly and with respect.Ministers discussed money laundering, which is a crime that can affect all Canadians by undermining the integrity of Canada\\'s financial institutions and facilitating organized crime, gang activity, and gun smuggling. Ministers reiterated their support for a coordinated approach to better address this problem.Ministers shared their views on the impact of the legalization of cannabis and enforcement issues, including the need for resources and tools to continue meeting the shared goals of protecting youth, eliminating illicit sales, combatting organized crime, and addressing drug-impaired driving.Ministers discussedhuman trafficking, which disproportionately affects women and girls, particularly Indigenous women and girls. Ministers supported further work to strengthen the response to this serious problem. Following a presentation by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, ministers affirmed their commitment to combatting online child sexual exploitation and assisting victims.Ministers will reconvene again in the fall to further collaborate and discuss these and other issues of importance to all jurisdictions.\\xa0Prior to the FPT meeting, Hereditary Chief and Songhees Elder, Elmer Seniemten George, welcomed ministers. Ministers had a conversation with representatives from the Assembly of First Nations and the Métis Nation. Participants discussed the federal government\\'s commitment to introduce legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Ministers also received a presentation on B.C.\\'s Indigenous-led, co-developed Indigenous Justice Strategies.Quick Facts\\nThe meeting was co-chaired by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, David Lametti, P.C.

       "  \"\\n\\nMore people working in B.C.'s TV and streaming industry\\xa0will soon have help getting projects off the ground through Access 2020, an innovative new partnership.Through this pilot program, B.C.-based producers will be eligible for up to $30,000\\xa0to support\\xa0early-stage development of children’s and scripted drama projects.The program is designed to make it easier for producers to access funding, as it does not require the secured support of a broadcaster. Eligible activities include research, script development and hiring a scriptwriter, as well as travel to pitch or market a project.“B.C. producers play a key role in our thriving TV sector, and we want to help them get more projects off the ground,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “This new Creative BC program leverages federal funding to give our B.C.-based producers more flexibility and more opportunities when developing projects.”Access 2020 is a $400,000 partnership between Creative BC, the Canada Media Fund (CMF) and the Canadian Media Producers Association – BC Producers Branch (CMPA-BC). This is the first time CMF has partnered with a provincial funding body and CMPA, recognizing the strength and reputation of B.C.’s industry.Access 2020 is part of Reel Focus BC, which is Creative BC’s suite of programs that support the domestic motion picture industry. Submissions for Access 2020 are open now and will be accepted until March 11, 2020.Quotes:Prem Gill, chief executive officer, Creative BC – “This is an exciting partnership that reflects commitment to the success of B.C.-based production companies. With this pilot program, we’re uniting to design new collaborations that bring federal support to the province for the domestic sector.”Valerie Creighton, president and chief executive officer, Canada Media Fund – “The Canada Media Fund is committed to supporting the B.C. production community. There is an enormous wealth of talent and know-how in this province, and this program will assist B.C. storytellers to thrive in the global, borderless marketplace.

       "  '\\n\\nMore than 475 people in Indigenous communities throughout British Columbia are gaining skills to succeed in high-opportunity trades careers, with six new two-year training programs.“For years, Indigenous leaders have been calling for skills training opportunities closer to home to support their community’s needs and self-determination,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Our government is responding to this Call to Action by working in partnership with Indigenous communities, the Industry Training Authority and employers. These new programs will create pathways for Indigenous workers to take advantage of the tens of thousands of in-demand jobs forecasted in the trades over the next decade.”Supported by the Industry Training Authority (ITA), the programs will address community priorities and opportunities with courses ranging from exploratory and introductory trades to construction and electrical training.“ITA’s committed to building strong partnerships with industry, training providers and Indigenous communities to create innovative programs that enable Indigenous people to gain exposure to the skilled trades and find meaningful careers,” said Shelley Gray, CEO, ITA. “These new programs will ensure more individuals have opportunities to access training and become apprentices while giving them the tools to be successful.”Programs include Kitselas First Nation’s Kitselas Community-Led Apprenticeship Development. Over two years, an estimated 48 people will receive introductory trades training that will pave the way to apprenticeships.“Investments from industries, such as LNG, mean it’s busy right now in northwest B.C., with tremendous opportunities to secure long-lasting careers in the skilled trades,” said Judy Gerow, Chief Councillor, Kitselas First Nation. “Making sure our members, and members of neighbouring Nations, have access to those opportunities is critical. The community-led program is one way we can do that. A successful career in the trades translates into economic security for families in our communities.”ITA is providing $7.5 million to support the six Indigenous training programs, with funding from the Canada-BC Workforce Development Agreement (WDA).B.C.’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act passed unanimously in November 2019, establishing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) as the framework for reconciliation in B.C.Skills training that improves employment opportunities responds to UNDRIP Article 21.1, asserting the rights of Indigenous peoples to improve their economic and social conditions, including through education and employment. It also responds to Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s\\xa0Call to Action 7, to eliminate educational and employment gaps between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.Quick Facts:\\nThe 2018 Labour Market Outlook projected nearly 71,000 trades job openings in the province through 2028.\\nTrades careers, in which skilled workers are in demand, include millwrights, heavy-duty mechanics, carpenters and electricians.\\nSigned in 2018, the WDA between the federal and provincial governments provides $685 million over six years and the flexibility to design and deliver locally driven, responsive and inclusive labour market programs for British Columbians.\\nLearn More:Industry Training Authority: https://www.itabc.ca/Kitselas First Nation Employment\\xa0and Training: http://kitselas.com/departments/employment-training/A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Our government did the hard work and delivered.“Over the last two years, our government has been diligent in developing a framework that puts passenger safety first, and we remained steadfast against pressures to abandon the safety measures we put in place. Road users can now be confident that B.C.’s ride-hailing services will comply with some of the highest safety standards in North America.“Since September 2019, the Passenger Transportation Board has been reviewing applications from 29 ride-hail companies and submissions from stakeholders. In the board’s decisions, it has committed to closely monitoring fleet sizes and minimum pricing to avoid potential impacts on traffic congestion and to ensure adequate incomes for drivers.“Our government is committed to work with both the ride-hail and taxi industries to address outstanding areas in the coming months and futures issues as they arise. We will continue to support a passenger transportation industry that gets people safely where they need to go and ensures sustainable livelihoods for drivers.”Quick Facts: \\nIn fall 2018, the provincial government passed the Passenger Transportation Amendment Act permitting ride-hailing companies to apply to the Passenger Transportation Board to enter the B.C. market in a way that protects passenger safety.\\nSubsequent regulations require ride-hail drivers to hold a Class 4 driver’s licence and undergo a vulnerable sector check – the most stringent type of police information check.\\nOn Dec. 12, 2019, the TransLink Mayor’s Council endorsed an inter-municipal business licence in order to have ride-hailing companies obtain a single licence to be able to operate across Metro Vancouver.\\nGovernment is committed to working with both ride-hail and taxi companies to address concerns moving forward.\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe Cascadia Timber Supply Area (TSA) has a new allowable annual cut (AAC) for timber harvesting.Harvesting will continue at a sustainable level and generate economic prosperity for British Columbians.The Cascadia TSA is dispersed throughout the Interior of British Columbia, mainly in the northwest and southeast of the province. Diane Nicholls, B.C.’s chief forester, announced that the new AAC is 356,230 cubic metres, effective Jan. 23, 2020. It will provide a reliable supply of Crown timber through competitive auctions.The new AAC is 10% lower than the current AAC of 397,818 cubic metres. The reduction was made to account for new information regarding forest-management practices and economic operability for the TSA.The Cascadia TSA is assigned to BC Timber Sales (BCTS) and consists of 11 timber-supply blocks. The new cut level includes the following partitions:\\n101,420 cubic metres\\xa0for the BCTS Kootenay Business Area;\\n63,000 cubic metres for the BCTS Okanagan-Columbia Business Area;\\n65,740 cubic metres for the BCTS Cariboo-Chilcotin Business Area; and\\n126,070 cubic metres for the BCTS Skeena Business Area.\\nThe partitions consider that the TSA\\xa0is widely spread\\xa0throughout the province\\xa0in four unique business areas.“After reviewing all of the available information on timber and non-timber resources for the distinct areas of this TSA, and consulting with First Nations, I am satisfied the new cut level will support a sustainable forest industry, while taking into consideration local social and economic objectives,” Nicholls said.The Cascadia TSA occupies a total area of over 316,000 hectares. It was created in 2011 by combining areas tree farm licences (TFL) and areas transferred from the Revelstoke and Arrow TSAs.BCTS auctions the timber from this TSA to the highest bidder and uses the bid information to support the provincial market pricing system for setting stumpage rates.The Cascadia TSA overlaps the traditional territory of 24 First Nations and First Nations groupings: Neskonlith Indian Band; Secwepemc Reconciliation Framework Agreement; Okanagan Nation Alliance; Okanagan Indian Band; Adams Lake Indian Band; Westbank First Nation; Splats’in First Nation; Shuswap Indian Band; Little Shuswap Lake Indian Band; Ktunaxa Nation Council; Tsilhqot’in Engagement Zone ‘A’; Lhatko Dene Nation; Xats’ull First Nation; Tsilhqot’in Nation, Notice of Civil Claim; Nazko First Nation; Kitsumkalum Band Council; Gitxsan Hereditary Chiefs; Kitselas First Nation; Skin Tyee First Nation; Wet’suwet’en First Nation; Metlakatla Band Council; Lax Kw’alaams Band; Office of the Wet’suwet’en; and the Haisla Nation.Along with this AAC decision, the chief forester issued an order reducing the AAC attributable to the BCTS Skeena Business Area by 7%, to account for the Kitsumkalum-Kitselas Designated Area.The chief forester’s determination takes into consideration requirements for old growth management areas, riparian areas, wildlife habitat areas and species at risk, such as caribou, bull trout, grizzly bear and ungulates (mountain goats, moose and deer).Quick Facts:\\nThe chief forester’s allowable annual cut determination is an independent, professional judgment based on information ranging from technical forestry reports, First Nations and public input to the government’s social and economic goals.\\nUnder the Forest Act, the chief forester must determine the allowable annual cut in each of the province’s 37 timber supply areas and 34 tree farm licences at least once every 10 years.\\nLearn More:For a copy of the allowable annual cut determination and a map of the Cascadia Timber Supply Area, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/timber-supply-review-and-allowable-annual-cut/allowable-annual-cut-timber-supply-areas/cascadia-tsa\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The consultations will be open until April 3, 2020.The panel will post an interim report of its findings from these consultations on its website in summer 2020, and provide a final report to the federal and provincial governments by the end of 2020.Quick Facts:\\nThe members of the panel are leaders and specialists in a wide range of fields. They will identify additional measures that federal and provincial governments, and possibly municipal governments, non-governmental organizations and other actors in housing markets, could undertake to improve supply and affordability in B.C.’s high-priced housing markets.\\nSince 2017, the B.C. government has taken a number of steps to tackle the housing crisis and deliver the affordable homes British Columbians need, including the largest investment in housing affordability in B.C.’s history — $7 billion over 10 years.\\nThrough a 30-point housing plan launched in 2018, the provincial government is working with partners to deliver 114,000 affordable homes over 10 years.

This agreement is an important next step in moving the project toward a final investment decision, construction and long-term operation. The mine received both federal and provincial environmental assessment certificates in 2019.“First Nations should share in the wealth from natural resource projects in their territory, and agreements like this one create a true partnership for economic development in the territory,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “When Indigenous communities are partners in the economy, we can build a stronger B.C. that includes everyone, creating opportunities for Indigenous peoples, B.C. businesses, communities and families everywhere.”In addition to creating a new source of revenue for the two Nations, the agreement commits to collaborative work to develop a process for engagement on future permitting associated with the mine.“On behalf of my community, we are pleased to support the Economic and Community Development Agreement (ECDA) with B.C. and look forward to the long-term stability it will provide for my current and future generations,” said Chief Liliane Squinas, Lhoosk’uz Dené Nation.Chief Lynda Price, Ulkatcho First Nation, said, “Ulkatcho First Nation agreed with the project only after our environmental concerns and conditions were addressed. This is another opportunity for UFN members to participate in the economy. The ECDA will support capacity development and prepare UFN moving forward in a positive direction. UFN acknowledge this has been a long process, which began in early 2012, and are grateful to have reached this milestone.”The revenue shared through the agreement could be worth as much as $217 million while the mine is operational. Mineral tax revenue will be shared equally between the two Nations.

       "  '\\n\\nJanuary 21, 2020\\xa0RICHMOND, B.C. – Four new Canada Line trains begin service today, increasing customer capacity by 15 per cent during peak hours. The brand-new trains will provide more space, frequency and comfort to customers.\\xa0These are the first of 12 new trains, which are being rolled out as part of Phase One of the Mayors’ 10-Year Transit Expansion Plan. Once more trains are in service later this year, there will be a total increase in capacity of approximately 35 per cent compared to 2019 service levels.\\xa0Delivered through the Public Transit Infrastructure Fund (PTIF), this $88 million investment is funded 50 per cent by the Government of Canada, 33 per cent by the Province of British Columbia, and 17 per cent by TransLink.\\xa0To support this increase in service, the Canada Line Operations and Maintenance Centre was upgraded and three additional escalators were installed at Canada Line Stations in 2019. This $36 million investment was also funded through PTIF.\\xa0The remaining trains are in the process of being delivered from Hyundai Rotem in South Korea. Upon arrival, the new trains will go through testing and commissioning before being certified for revenue service later this year.\\xa0Quick Facts:\\xa0\\nIn 2019, for the first time, there were more than 50 million boardings on the Canada Line\\xa0\\nWith more than 150,000 trips taken on an average weekday in 2019, that is an increase of about 3 per cent compared to 2018\\xa0\\nCanada Line is a 19-kilometre route with 16 stations, two bridges and nine kilometres of tunnel\\xa0\\n21 per cent of travellers use the Canada Line for their journey to or from YVR\\xa0\\nImproving transit and transportation infrastructure is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement\\xa0\\nQuotes:\\xa0Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities –\\xa0“Good public transit builds strong communities and helps create jobs. Adding more trains on the Canada Line will help residents by providing more frequent service. Our historic investments in transit infrastructure are making a real difference in the lives of the people of Metro Vancouver.”\\xa0Bowinn Ma, Parliamentary Secretary for TransLink –\\xa0“The addition of these new Canada Line cars will help more people get to where they need to go faster, whether it is downtown Vancouver, YVR or Richmond, letting them avoid congestion and giving them more time to spend with friends and family. This service increase is one more example of how our shared goal of reliable and efficient transit is making a difference for people. Our government’s commitment to fund 40% of the capital costs of each phase of the Mayors’ Council’s 10-Year Vision will result in continued transit improvements throughout the region making life better for everyone.”\\xa0Malcolm Brodie, Mayor of Richmond –\\xa0“Since its inception just before the 2010 Olympics, the Canada Line has played a vital role in the development and growth of Metro Vancouver. Investments like these not only make our transit system more accessible and enjoyable, but it also ensures that we can keep up with the demand as more people are choosing to take transit to get to where they need to go.”\\xa0Kevin Desmond, CEO, TransLink –\\xa0“The Canada Line is an integral part of the transit system and its booming ridership reflects that. Ridership has been strong since it opened, and regular weekday ridership has grown 25 per cent since then. This increase in service and the upcoming increase later this year will provide relief to our customers who depend on the Canada Line every day.”\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

It takes less than 10 minutes to complete. \\xa0The quickest way is online: gov.bc.ca/spectaxAll owners on the title, including spouses and relatives, must complete a declaration in order to claim an exemption or to determine eligibility for a tax credit. If owners are not exempt, they must pay their assessed amount by July 2, 2020. In addition to previous exemptions, military families and those with water-access-only properties will be exempt.“Some would have us give tax breaks to speculators and return to out-of-control housing price increases, but we’re committed to cracking down on speculation and increasing affordable housing options,” James said. “We’re beginning to see moderation in the housing market, and over the past year we’ve seen more rental condos being put on the market and an increase in purpose-built rentals. These are encouraging signs for making housing more affordable for families in B.C.”According to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s 2019 rental report, the number of apartments in the long-term rental stock in Metro Vancouver in 2019 increased by nearly 19% from 2018 – the most significant annual increase in more than a decade. The report further states that policies introduced at the government level are contributing to the number of condos available in the long-term rental stock, with BC Housing data confirming that purpose-built rentals represented nearly 30% of units registered in 2019, compared to 16.4% in 2018.If people have questions or need help completing their declaration over the phone, they can call: 1 833 554-2323 (toll-free Canada/U.S.) or 1 604 660-2421 (international), Monday to Sunday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Service is available in multiple languages.Learn More:To learn more about the speculation and vacancy tax and exemptions, visit: gov.bc.ca/spectaxTo learn more about government’s 30-point plan for housing affordability, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/A backgrounder follows.Translations:For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Declaration_Begins_SVT_French.pdfFor a\\xa0Punjabi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Declaration_Begins_SVT_Traditional_Punjabi.pdfFor a\\xa0Traditional Chinese translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Declaration_Begins_SVT_Traditional_Chinese.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Funding is being provided through the HousingHub, a BC Housing branch that works with community, government and non-profit and private-sector stakeholders to increase affordable rental housing and home ownership options for middle-income British Columbians. It acts as a centre for housing expertise and collaboration and helps create housing either through new construction or through redeveloping existing sites.The complex consists of two one-bedroom units and four two-bedroom units. Renovations to these units will increase the building’s lifespan and ensure six homes for low- and middle-income Indigenous individuals and families remain accessible.“We are excited to be able to keep these homes on the market,” said Christos Vardacostas, executive director, Aboriginal Housing Society of Prince George. “Having a home is fundamental, and this is a great opportunity for us to work with the Province to make sure these spaces stay affordable and available.”The society has assumed ownership and operations of the residence. The current tenants of the building will not be affected by the acquisition. Monthly rents will be carried over at the same rates.The society provides safe, healthy and affordable housing for Indigenous peoples in the region and serves approximately 500 people in Prince George on Lheidli T’enneh traditional territory.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Fact:\\nThrough provincial investments, more than 22,000 new homes are complete, under construction or in development for people with a range of incomes around the province, including close to 220 homes in Prince George.\\nLearn More:HousingHub: https://www.bchousing.org/partner-services/housinghubA map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo find out what the Province is doing to improve housing affordability, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/bc-government-addressing-housing-affordability-challengesA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Shore Rd.Members of the B.C. gypsy moth technical advisory committee will be joined by representatives from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, Ministry of Agriculture and Canadian Food Inspection Agency, as well as other experts, to answer questions and provide information about the 2019 trapping season and the planned 2020 aerial spray program.The 2019 trapping data shows that a population of moths in Lake Cowichan has persisted for at least two years and appears to be growing. The gypsy moth technical advisory committee has determined that it is necessary to treat 231 hectares of residential and municipal land to eradicate gypsy moth.The planned treatment will use aircraft to apply Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk), a biological insecticide that occurs naturally in soil and is commonly used in organic agriculture. Btk is effective at treating gypsy moth. It affects only caterpillars that eat sprayed leaves and has a proven safety record around humans. Livestock, pets, birds, fish, spiders, bees, ladybugs and amphibians are not impacted by Btk.The gypsy moth is an introduced pest species. The caterpillars feed on tree leaves and can damage forests, farms and orchards. Large gypsy moth populations have defoliated sections of forests and residential areas in Ontario and the eastern United States in recent years.Learn More:To learn more about gypsy moths, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/gypsymothOr call toll-free: 1 866 917-5999For information about the permit application and to view a map of the treatment zone, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/forest-health/invasive-forest-pests/gypsy-moth/newsThe permit application and maps are also available at:\\nLake Cowichan City Hall\\n39 S.

De plus, un service de garde à la petite enfance est assuré par la Société de la petite enfance de l’école Entre-lacs.Il est prévu, à long terme, que l’école Entre-lacs intègre progressivement un programme d’enseignement secondaire, mais cette intégration n’aura aucune incidence négative sur les élèves du CSF qui sont inscrits à l’heure actuelle au programme francophone de l’école secondaire de Penticton.Par la même occasion, le CSF acquiert les installations de l’ancienne école intermédiaire Nkwala, qui a fermé ses portes en 2016 par manque d’élèves.

The ranking will be placed on a shop-locator ICBC webpage, enabling drivers to make informed choices about where to take their vehicles for repair, while encouraging shops to be top performers.“After consulting with industry leaders, the redesign of the collision and glass repair programs will improve transparency and accountability of repair shops for drivers who get into accidents and need to choose which repair shop they go to,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “By publicly ranking the repair shops by performance, where repair shops strive to be the top performers, we expect that this will help curb some of the rising claims costs and pressures that ICBC is facing.”The new collision program will take effect Feb. 3, 2020, and the new glass program will take effect March 2, 2020. Combined, both programs will encompass approximately 1,000 collision and glass repair shops throughout the province. However, the repair shop ranking will be made available only after significant data is collected.“ICBC appreciates the repair industry’s willingness to work with us to manage performance effectively, and we will continue to consult with our industry advisory committee and technical working group to continuously improve the new programs over time,” said Nicolas Jimenez, CEO, ICBC.The changes to the glass and collision repair programs come after government launched an operational audit of ICBC, which resulted in recommendations on ways to improve management of material damage vendors.Quotes:Adrian Scovell, president and CEO, Automotive Retailers Association – “The Automotive Retailers Association represents 1,000-plus automotive service providers throughout B.C.

At a time when more affordable housing is so desperately needed in our city, we look forward to that day when we can welcome our newest residents to their new Southwest Marine Drive home.”Construction is expected to begin in spring 2020.These homes are part of the more than 22,000 new homes that are completed or underway throughout B.C. because of provincial investments.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nThis housing development is funded through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund, a $1.9-billion investment over 10 years to build more than 14,000 mixed-income rental homes throughout the province.\\nMore than 5,200 of these homes are in development and under construction, including more than 1,000 homes in Vancouver.\\n\\nThe project on Southwest Marine Drive will reflect the following mix of incomes:\\n20 units for people with annual incomes up to approximately $26,000;\\n51 units for households with incomes ranging between approximately $25,000 and $73,000; and\\n31 units for households with incomes up to approximately $113,000.\\n\\nLearn More:A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is online:\\nhttps://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/To learn more about the locations of housing projects supported by the City of Vancouver’s Affordable Housing Agency, visit: https://vaha.ca/projects/To learn about the steps the City of Vancouver is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for Vancouver residents, visit:\\nhttps://vancouver.ca/people-programs/housing-vancouver-strategy.aspxTo learn more about New Chelsea Society, visit: https://www.newchelsea.ca/A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe new, state-of-the-art Stuart Lake Hospital that will provide better health care and create more jobs for people is ready for construction, following the Province’s approval of the project business plan.“For more than 12 years, people in Fort St. James were promised a new hospital, but the old government failed to act and patients were left waiting without the health care they need and deserve,” said Premier John Horgan. “After years of delay, I’m proud that our government is getting it done, so people can get the health care they count on. This project will give the community an economic boost, with hundreds of new construction jobs and the highest quality health care for people in the region. This is all part of our plan to deliver better health care, closer to home.”The new hospital will be three times larger than the current facility with 27 beds, including 18 long-term care beds. There will be an emergency department with two treatment rooms, a trauma bay and ambulance bay. A laboratory and diagnostic imaging will also be part of the new facility.The hospital will include a primary care centre that will consolidate services currently being offered in Fort St. James to one location, reducing the distance patients and staff need to go for diagnostic imaging and lab services. It will be home to physicians, visiting specialists, substance-use supports, home and community care, and public health.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Approximately 450 direct and 300 indirect jobs will be created during construction.The estimated project cost is $116 million, shared between the Province through Northern Health, and Stuart-Nechako Regional Hospital District, which will contribute $20 million.With government approval of the business plan, the project will proceed to procurement. Construction is expected to begin in summer 2021. The hospital is targeted to open for patients in 2024.“We are moving forward with a new hospital for people in Fort St. James and area, which will bring high-quality public health care, as well as community-based services in one location to the region for decades to come,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Many partners helped get us to this important milestone, and I want to thank Stuart-Nechako Hospital District, the community of Fort St. James, and the Nak’azdli Whut’en, Yekooche First Nation, Tl’azt’en Nation (Tache, Binche, Middle River) and Takla Lake First Nation.”The new hospital will be built on the same site as the existing one. Once complete, the existing facility will be demolished to make way for parking.The current hospital opened in 1972 and is outdated in terms of space, functionality and technology. The hospital has 12 beds and offers emergency, acute and complex care, as well as residential care, lab and X-ray services, as well as mental-health and addictions counselling.Discussions regarding the replacement of the hospital have been ongoing since 2008. In September 2015, Northern Health submitted a concept plan to the Ministry of Health. Northern Health submitted a revised concept plan to government in summer 2018, which was approved in October 2018. The business plan phase finalizes details, such as scope and budget.All new hospitals in B.C. are planned to a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold standard.The investment in a new Stuart Lake Hospital is part of a wide range of work underway to deliver comprehensive health services for people in the Northern Health region. This includes a redeveloped and expanded Dawson Creek and District Hospital, a new Mills Memorial Hospital in Terrace, two new urgent and primary care centres in Prince George and Quesnel, as well as progress made for a new emergency department and intensive care unit with redevelopment of the G.R. Baker Memorial Hospital in Quesnel.Quotes:Colleen Nyce, board chair, Northern Health –“We are thankful to Premier Horgan, Minister Dix and the provincial government for the decision to move to the next steps in replacing the Stuart Lake Hospital and for investing in health care for the people in Fort St. James and area. This collaborative project was brought together by the Province of B.C., the Stuart Nechako Regional Hospital District, Northern Health and the people residing in the communities and area served by Stuart Lake Hospital.”Jerry Petersen, chair, Stuart Nechako Regional Hospital District –“This investment announcement within our region is tremendous news for the community of Fort St. James and the surrounding rural and First Nation populations that rely on the invaluable local health services provided from this facility, not only today, but now secured for the future. A long-term commitment to health care in Fort St. James alleviates pressures in our neighbouring communities, and for that, a well-deserved thank you to the provincial government, Northern Health and regional hospital district elected officials and staff for your dedication and commitment to this project.”A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nSmall businesses, non-profits and arts and culture organizations paying high property taxes through their commercial leases will be able to\\xa0get relief\\xa0through interim business property tax relief legislation that is under development.The legislation, to be introduced this spring, would give municipalities the ability to provide property tax relief to small businesses and organizations that they identify as paying high property taxes. These taxes are a result of the combination of years of increasing real estate values and their commercial lease terms, including triple-net leases.“I understand people’s frustration after years of an out-of-control real estate market have left many small businesses, non-profits and arts organizations struggling with unexpectedly large tax increases,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “With this interim legislation, we are giving municipalities the tools they need to provide immediate property tax relief to targeted properties, for 2020, while we continue to work with stakeholders on a permanent provincewide fix. The old government heard concerns and did nothing – we listened and got to work on solutions for people.”Under the current assessment system, properties are valued based on “highest and best use,”\\xa0which means land with a single-storey commercial building on it may be valued as if it were being used as a multi-storey residential tower. Though “highest and best use” is a standard industry appraisal principle in many jurisdictions, it can result in an increased tax burden for tenants when there is an unexpected spike in value due to factors such as zoning changes\\xa0or changes to an official community plan.The interim legislation would allow municipalities to exempt a portion of the value of a subset of commercial properties from taxation, easing the tax burden for tenants responsible for property taxes through their commercial leases.The proposed legislation would apply to the 2020 tax year and be in effect for a maximum of five years. It is being designed to provide a way for municipalities with enough flexibility to provide tax exemptions to target specific businesses and non-profit organizations to support those most impacted by the current framework, without changing an already complex assessment system.As this legislation is still under development, the Province will provide more information in the coming weeks.Learn More: For an overview of BC Assessment's work, services and more, visit: https://www.bcassessment.ca/\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

The kitchen will allow for cooking courses for children at the centre, including making jam, yogurt, soup and other simple snacks. The facility will also provide accessible washrooms and a widened sidewalk for wheelchair accessibility.“The\\xa0creation of these new child care spaces in the community will allow more parents the opportunity to accept jobs that they previously were unable to accept because they could not find consistent child care,” said Hope Norum, manager, Canoe Valley Community Association. “The community currently has one licensed multi-aged care program with a waiting list. Spaces for school aged children are extremely limited in the community and desperately needed.”The spaces are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history, with more than 10,400 funded in the past 15 months. With the addition of 900 spaces funded through partnerships with the Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM) and Aboriginal Head Start using federal funding, and 4,100 spaces created through the 2017 Budget Update, more than 15,400 spaces have been funded in B.C.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in the region save more than $3.5 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nThe municipality of Valemount received $5,060 to undertake a needs assessment and create a child care action plan for the community to determine the child care needs of local families over the next 10 years.

The project received $32.5 million from the Government of Canada, $11.8 million from the Government of British Columbia and $47.1 million from UBC.The official opening of the new facility was celebrated with Joyce Murray, federal Minister of Digital Government; Bruce Ralston, B.C.’s Minister of Jobs, Trade and Technology, on behalf of Mark; David Eby, MLA for Vancouver-Point Grey; Santa J. Ono, UBC president and vice-chancellor; and university students, faculty and staff.“This historic investment by the Government of Canada is a down payment on the government’s vision to position Canada as a global centre for innovation,” said Navdeep Bains, federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. “This means making Canada a world leader in turning ideas into solutions, science into technologies, skills into jobs and startup companies into global successes.”The project demolished, renovated and expanded decades-old teaching spaces in the Biological Sciences Centre, north wings and Wesbrook and D.H. Copp buildings at UBC. It consolidates all undergraduate life and biological sciences on campus into one space, including botany, zoology, microbiology and immunology, physiological sciences, biochemistry and molecular biology, with physical space for faculty and over 2,600 students in UBC’s life-sciences programs.“When students learn in modern, cutting-edge laboratories, they get to explore practical problems in a supportive environment that prepares them for the job market,” said Ralston. “The new Undergraduate Life Sciences Teaching Laboratories will help students lead in exciting fields of discovery and succeed in our growing life-sciences sector.”Investments through the Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund are being used to modernize facilities at Canadian universities and colleges, as well as improve the energy efficiency of these facilities and reduce their impact on the environment.The project renovated 5,490 square metres, renewed 5,348 square metres and added 9,069 square metres. It also improved the environmental performance of the facility to be consistent with CleanBC and is targeting LEED Gold standard certification.CleanBC is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and supports a commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s targets.This new facility supports programs that can contribute to a cleaner B.C. For example, students can go on to work in the biotechnology sector, developing bacteria that consume toxic chemicals and reduce pollution, or research environmental degradation.Quotes:Joyce Murray, federal Minister of Digital Government –“The Government of Canada’s investment in The University of British Columbia is creating the right conditions for innovation and long-term growth, which will keep the Canadian economy globally competitive. It’s not only about creating jobs today; we are helping prepare young Canadians for the well-paying middle-class jobs of tomorrow.”David Eby, MLA for Vancouver-Point Grey –“UBC is an integral part of a vibrant Vancouver community and a global leader in teaching, learning and research. The new Undergraduate Life Sciences Teaching Laboratories allow it to continue to provide world-class education to its students and to develop tomorrow’s scientific leaders who will make life better for future generations of people in British Columbia and beyond.”Santa J.

The new facility will add 600 student seats to Lake Country, eliminating the equivalent of 24 portables so students can be better connected to their school community.\"We are very excited that work is underway on a new middle school to serve the growing community of Lake Country,\" said Moyra Baxter, chair of Central Okanagan Public Schools Board of Education. \"H.S. Grenda Middle School will serve our students well by supporting grade reconfiguration in the area and providing an innovative learning environment.\"This investment is part of the Province’s plan to give students the best learning experience possible, in positive, engaging and inspiring learning environments.Since September 2017, government has approved over $1.7 billion for new and expanded schools, seismic upgrades and land purchases for future schools.

The addition of a poverty law clinic in our community is a great step forward in reducing these barriers and supporting the rights of low-income individuals that has been ignored for too many years.”Josh Paterson, executive director, Law Foundation of BC —“The Law Foundation of BC is pleased to support the people of Kamloops and the Thompson-Nicola region through this announcement. There is no substitute for face-to-face interactions when it comes to legal counsel, and we are confident this funding will only enhance the Kamloops and District Elizabeth Fry Society’s ability to provide support and improved outcomes for vulnerable people.”Brandy, client, Kamloops and District Elizabeth Fry Society —“When my case needed assistance from a lawyer, I had to contact an organization in Vancouver. This is an awesome idea. I like talking face-to-face, not over the phone. Being a visual person, I find it better to have the personal contact. Having everything in one spot saves time, whether it is searching for the legal provider that can address my need, meeting regularly with my representative as my case progresses, or making it easier, financially and physically, to provide evidence and documents in a timely fashion.”Learn More:Law Foundation of BC: https://www.lawfoundationbc.org/Kamloops and District Elizabeth Fry Society: www.kamloopsefry.com\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nMount Elphinstone, located on the west side of Howe Sound between Gibsons and Sechelt on British Columbia’s Sunshine Coast, is designated as provincial forest. Current land use supports management for a variety of values, including forestry, water, wildlife and recreation.Mount Elphinstone land use\\nAll forestry activities on Crown land are managed according to established legal objectives for protection of recreation, soils, timber supply, wildlife, water, fish, biodiversity (e.g., old forest representation), visual landscapes and cultural resources.\\nCurrently, parkland and open space available for recreation in the Sunshine Coast Regional District total 15,400 hectares, with approximately, 12,200 hectares classified as provincial park.\\nMount Elphinstone Provincial Park, which has three separate units totalling 139 hectares, was established in 2000 as part of the Lower Mainland Protected Areas Strategy.\\nSince its inception in 2003, BC Timber Sales (BCTS) has operated on Mount Elphinstone to support timber pricing that ensures British Columbians get a fair return for use of Crown resources and to generate revenue for the Province.\\nBCTS has consistently worked with local stakeholders to meet community concerns that include the addition of new old growth management areas, buffering trails of importance to the local community and incorporating specific measures to protect riparian and aquatic areas.\\nThere are no provincial plans to expand the existing provincial park. However, the Province is cognizant of aspirations of the Sunshine Coast Regional District and some community groups to enhance protection in the Mount Elphinstone area. Initiatives, such as modernized land-use planning (jointly lead by the Province and the shíshálh Nation) and the Old Growth Strategic Review, may influence future land management or use in this area.\\nManagement strategies to address key values on Mount Elphinstone\\nOld growth management areas are used to help achieve biodiversity targets and provide protection for a variety of forest values on the land base. There are more than 2,900 hectares in old growth management areas in the Mount Elphinstone area and some are established along Mount Elphinstone Park boundaries.\\nAt-risk rare plant communities exist across the landscape, including the Mount Elphinstone area, and are managed by maintaining or improving the amount and distribution of mature and older-age forests over time.\\xa0\\nAs the forests grow older, particularly in areas designated to conserve or protect forest values across the landscape, the risk of losing adequate representation of these plant communities decreases. Ongoing BCTS management practices will result in an increase in the amount of older forests in this landscape unit, while still accommodating some timber harvesting.\\nAt the site level, rare plant communities are managed by foresters who locate the communities and incorporate management strategies into forest harvest and silviculture plans. At a site level, wildlife tree retention areas can provide additional representation of and protection across the landscape in conjunction with forest development planning as management strategies may specifically involve adjusting the shape or position of the cutblock to avoid the rare plant community or using the rare and endangered plant community to “anchor” a wildlife tree retention area.\\nThe Province continues to assess the effectiveness of this management approach for rare plant communities and will present a report to the Forest Practices Board, specific to Mount Elphinstone, by the end of 2019.\\nIn recognition of the importance that this area has to local residents, BCTS has reduced the average harvest rate to about 27 hectares per year on the south-facing slope of Mount Elphinstone – a rate of harvest approximately half the rate that the area can support.\\nOver the years, BCTS has responded to input from various stakeholders who participated in the BCTS community consultation process, and blocks have been dropped or converted into old growth management areas.\\nTimber Sales Licence A93884\\nTimber sales licence A93884, known as Clack Creek, first appeared in the 2008 BCTS operating plan that was shared with community groups, First Nations and local governments.\\nAs a result of stakeholder input, the size of the harvest area has been reduced by 30% and wildlife tree retention areas have increased by 20%.\\nA93884 is comprised largely of second-growth forest with scattered Douglas fir veteran trees that survived historical fire or harvesting on the south face of Mount Elphinstone. Specific measures incorporated into the final design of A93884 exceed legal requirements, including:\\nbuffering a popular mountain bike trail from harvest;\\nplacing additional setbacks on streams;\\nretaining veteran Douglas fir trees that survived historical fire and logging;\\nremoving areas that support development of the western red cedar/sword fern dry maritime ecosystem;\\nreducing the harvest area to exclude patches of Rubus nivalis, snow bramble, a yellow-listed plant species;\\nwater quality monitoring during and after harvest for block C3MY, the eastern block;\\nretaining 70% of the forest cover in block C46N (western block) as part of a long-term research trial.\\n\\nTimber sales licence A93884 was issued on May 9, 2019.\\xa0Harvesting began on Jan. 10, 2020. The term of the sale is two years with the possibility of extension for up to two additional years.\\nThe licence of 29,499 cubic metres will support local employment and provide over $2 million in stumpage revenue to the Province.\\nPublic comments related to BCTS operations on the Sunshine Coast should be addressed to: BCTS.Powell.River@gov.bc.ca\\nAbout BCTS\\nBCTS was established in 2003 to provide benchmark costs and prices from the harvest of Crown timber in British Columbia.\\nAuctioning timber to the highest bidder allows BCTS to set long-term rates for tenure holders that ensure British Columbians receive a fair return for harvested timber.\\nBCTS manages about 20% of the provincial allowable annual cut through 12 business areas.\\nIn 2019, BCTS generated $430 million in gross revenue for the Province, including $15 million from the Sunshine Coast alone.\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

The centre promotes an inclusive environment with a fully accessible building and support staff for children with special needs.“Early childhood education is such an important period of time, and the provision of progressive, inclusive, and for-childhood programming to support our youth and families adds so much to the future of our communities,” said Mary Sutherland, centre director. “Lulu’s main drive is to do just that, and to have the support of the New Spaces Fund means we are able to make that vision a reality.”When complete, the centre will boast four programming spaces, four quiet areas and 307 square metres (3,300 square feet) of adaptable outdoor space. A vegetable garden and open-air concept will allow children to connect to the natural world. The use of natural landscaping will promote movement, imaginary play and encourage body awareness and balance.Nearly 90 new, affordable licensed child care spaces in Sidney have been funded by the Province since the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund launched in July 2018.

Compared to 2016, the increase is even more significant, at more than double the 5,173 rentals registered that year. Data from the most recent three years, 2017-19, shows 28,642 new purpose-built rental homes were registered, which is more than the previous decade’s combined total.“Our government’s record investments in housing affordability, along with measures to reduce speculation in the market and stimulate an increase in rental supply, are delivering much-needed rental homes for people throughout the province,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “This data is an encouraging sign that we are heading in the right direction and that our policy actions are shifting the market toward delivering more of the right type of housing that meets the needs of the people who live here.”Purpose-built rentals represented more than a quarter (28.2%) of all housing units registered in 2019, up from 16.4% in 2018 and the highest proportion achieved since BC Housing started collecting this data in 2002.This increase in purpose-built rentals comes in the context of continued high levels of new home registrations, with the last three years representing record levels, well above the 10-year average. Registered new home\\xa0data is a leading indicator of housing activity in B.C. as the data is collected at the beginning of a project before building permits are issued.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:\\nUnder the Homeowner Protection Act, all new homes in the province are required to be registered with BC Housing.

The gypsy moth technical advisory committee has determined it is necessary to treat 167 hectares to eradicate gypsy moth.The planned treatment will use aircraft to apply Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk), a biological insecticide that occurs naturally in soil and is commonly used in organic agriculture. Btk is effective at treating gypsy moth. It impacts only caterpillars that eat sprayed leaves and has a proven safety record around humans. Livestock, pets, birds, fish, spiders, bees, ladybugs and amphibians are not impacted by Btk.The gypsy moth is an introduced pest species.

       "  '\\n\\nThe BC Coroners Service continues to work with the RCMP, New York Academy of the Arts and the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner on a unique project that combines art and science and solicits help from the public to identify decedents using reconstructed faces.The BC Coroners Service provided the RCMP with skulls from 14 unidentified human remains investigations in B.C. dating back to 1972. The skulls\\xa0were then recreated with 3D printing and transported to the New York Academy of the Arts. Facial reconstruction was done by students in New York with the hope that, with the public’s help, they will soon be able to put names to these faces.“The 14 skulls provided by the BC Coroners Service as reference material are part of the B.C. inventory of cold cases,” said Eric Petit, director, Special Investigations Unit, BC Coroners Service. “Specifically, these are investigations where we have reached an impasse in terms of identifying the deceased individuals.”In total, 15 skulls were provided for the project, including one from Nova Scotia. However, these victims could be from anywhere. Anyone who thinks they might recognize a face is asked to submit tips on the Canada’s Missing website.“This partnership is a unique opportunity to try to draw new breath into otherwise stalled investigations,” Petit said. “Our hope is that these reconstructions will trigger a memory that results in someone connecting with us or the RCMP, which will lead us to identifying these individuals. This collaborative project builds on other identification tools, including our unidentified human remains viewer, to help us close cold cases in our province.”Traditionally, when human remains are found, investigators use a variety of methods to identify the person. They may compare the remains to descriptions of reported missing persons. They can send samples for DNA testing or search dental records. Often, these methods yield results, but when they are unsuccessful, police, coroners and medical examiners might turn to more creative methods.“This project was a true collaborative effort by many agencies within Canada, and we are grateful to the BC Coroners Service for\\xa0 their\\xa0significant contribution,” said Marie-Claude Arsenault, RCMP chief superintendent and the officer in charge of the RCMP’s sensitive and specialized investigative services. “Every face tells a story, and these are 15 individuals who deserve to have their stories told. Any detail, no matter how small it may seem, could be the missing piece of the puzzle.”Students at the academy’s forensic sculpture workshop reconstructed the faces under the guidance of Joe Mullins, a senior forensic artist with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the U.S. The BC Coroners Service and the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner provided information such as sex, ethnicity and height for the unidentified human remains investigations. Armed with that knowledge, as well as their anatomical expertise and artistic skills, the students spent the week reconstructing the faces by applying clay to 3D-printed versions of actual skulls.The reconstructed faces will go on display in New York in April 2020\\xa0as part of the New York Academy of Art’s Open Studios event.Quick Facts:\\nThe New York Academy of Art has hosted its forensic sculpture workshop annually since 2015.\\nSince 2015, four visual identifications have been directly attributed to facial reconstructions performed during the workshop.\\nIn B.C., there are 179 unidentified human remains investigations open.\\nThere are currently over 700 unidentified remains in the RCMP’s national database of missing persons and unidentified remains.\\nLearn More:Canada’s Missing: http://www.canadasmissing.ca/index-eng.htmBC Coroners Service: http://www.gov.bc.ca/coronersFacial reconstruction page: https://www.services.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/missing-disparus/results-resultats.jsf?lang=en&gcwu-srch=nyaaRCMP partners with New York Academy of Art to identify the lost: http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/news/2020/rcmp-partners-new-york-academy-art-identify-the-lostNew York Academy of Art: https://nyaa.edu/BC Coroners Service’s Unidentified Human Remains Viewer: https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=1a60c24b82ed41699d8a55338fb11076Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service: https://novascotia.ca/just/cme/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe provincial government is more than doubling the number of specialty nurse training opportunities in the province by funding 1,000 seats each year at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT).This increase will help meet growing demand for care throughout British Columbia. Specialty nurses work in high-skill areas ranging from emergency settings to intensive care units for high-risk cardiac care patients, to delivering babies and providing newborn care, to working with complex patients with multiple health challenges.“Specialty nurses help us when we need emergency care; they help deliver our babies and they care for us when we are seriously ill,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Increasing the number of specialty nurse seats helps people get trained for some of the most important and in-demand jobs in B.C. That is why we created more training opportunities for nurses – so they have the tools they need to be there for British Columbians when we need them most.”BCIT’s specialty nursing training program is one of Canada’s most comprehensive, providing nurses advanced hands-on training for work in hospital and community settings.\\xa0“BCIT offers a balanced education of theory and hands-on experience for its nursing students to be job-ready. I am surrounded by a small cohort of classmates and passionate instructors who are supportive and empowering,” said Christina Dixon, BCIT nursing student, school of health sciences. “It feels like a community and team, making a strong parallel to the clinical setting. As an Indigenous nursing student, I am honoured and prepared to make a long-term difference, while creating a culturally safe and supportive environment for patients from all backgrounds.”\\xa0Starting in 2018-19, the Province added 611 training seats to the previous 389 seat baseline for a total of 1,000 seats. The Province is providing funding at that level for 2019-20 and 2020-21 and will continue to provide support going forward to help ensure B.C.’s health-care workforce is ready to meet patient needs.“Caring for B.C.’s growing and aging population is a priority for this government, which is why we’re investing in specialty nursing programs so students can train for high-demand careers that are critical for modern health care in our province,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “We are expanding nursing and health-care programs across the province including in the North, the Northeast and on Vancouver Island because we understand British Columbians need and deserve top-quality health care.”Nursing is one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the province, due to a growing and aging population. Approximately 60% of B.C.’s nurses work in complex or acute settings in health authorities – up from 44% four years ago. The demand for specialty nurses, such as perinatal, emergency and critical care, is increasing throughout the province.“This funding will give more nurses the professional development they need to accelerate their careers and to apply for leadership, teaching and community health positions,” said Jacqollyne Keath, board chair, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of British Columbia. “Specialty nursing is a rewarding and in demand career with positions available around the province.”Doubling the number of specialty nurse seats is part of ongoing efforts from the ministries of Health and Advanced Education, Skills and Training to ensure the number, type and location of health-care training opportunities meet B.C.’s patient and population needs.“With one of the most comprehensive specialty nursing programs in Canada, BCIT is proud to support the thousands of nurses that are a cornerstone of the B.C. health-care system,” said Kathy Kinloch, president, BCIT. “This investment from the provincial government enables BCIT to expand quality specialty nursing training that directly supports B.C.’s health-care sector.” \\xa0The ministries of Health and Advanced Education, Skills and Training work closely with health authorities and other partners to align the number, type and location of health-care workers to meet patient and population needs.“On behalf of nurses around this province, the BC Nurses’ Union welcomes this significant investment in specialty education,” said Christine Sorensen, president, British Columbia Nurse’s Union. “Today’s announcement is a promising step toward addressing the province’s nurse shortage and the impact it’s having on patient care. We look forward to continuing to work with government and all stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive health human resources plan is in place to manage this complex issue.”This increase supports additional actions by the government to ensure expanded nursing education opportunities in B.C. In June 2019, the first nursing degree program in the Northeast was announced. The University of Northern British Columbia’s program is a five-semester, two-year bachelor of science in nursing program, which will support 32 students at full capacity. The first class of 16 student spaces, to be operated out of Northern Lights College in Fort St. John, is expected to be up and running this fall.Learn More:For more information on the specialty nursing program at BCIT, visit:\\nhttps://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/specialtynursingNursing degree program coming to the Northeast:\\nhttps://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019AEST0070-001195Creating new opportunities for nurse practitioners as part of team-based care system:\\nhttps://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nA previously announced inquest into the death of Dylan Levi Judd has been cancelled.Judd died in custody at the Kamloops Regional Correctional Centre in November 2014.An inquest into Judd’s death was originally announced in 2015 when it was determined that the public had an interest in being informed of the circumstances surrounding the death.Subsequent investigation led to an individual being charged with second-degree murder in connection with Judd’s death. A B.C. Supreme Court trial ran for approximately nine days and concluded in 2019 with an acquittal. The reasons for judgment of Justice Sheri Ann Donegan are publicly available.The chief coroner has determined that the criminal trial served to inform the public of the circumstances of this death and, therefore, there is no longer a need to hold an inquest for that purpose. As a result, the investigation into Judd’s death will be concluded by way of a coroner’s report.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

In 2017, the RTB launched a new online dispute-resolution service portal that makes it easier for renters and landlords to submit applications to resolve tenancy problems.The Province has also increased the number of RTB staff, leading to a notable decrease in dispute resolution wait times for landlords and tenants, and established a new compliance unit to take action against landlords and tenants who are repeat or serious offenders.Learn More:Information about submitting an online application for dispute resolution can be found here: http://www.gov.bc.ca/landlordtenant/onlineInformation about submitting a paper application for dispute resolution can be found here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies/apply-online/complete-an-application\\xa0\\n\\n \\n\"],\n",

Le gouvernement du Canada est heureux de travailler avec le gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique pour aider à la formation d’un nombre encore plus grand d’éducateurs qualifiés.\\xa0»Le gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique a lancé l’ECE Education Support Fund en septembre\\xa02018, avec comme objectif de venir en aide à 4\\xa0000\\xa0étudiants d’ici la fin de mars\\xa02020.

Depuis trois ans, l’intérêt des étudiants pour l’éducation à la petite enfance a été tout simplement extraordinaire, et ces bourses permettront d’aider encore plus de gens à acquérir la formation nécessaire pour cette profession très demandée.

       "  '\\n\\nPeople living in the Central Okanagan now have better access to team-based day-to-day public health care with the opening of the new Kelowna Urgent and Primary Care Centre (UPCC).“The Kelowna UPCC will help connect more people in Central Okanagan communities with the health care they need, when they need it,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Thousands of area residents who currently lack a primary-care provider will benefit from increased access to same-day appointments for urgent needs and ongoing primary care, as well being able to find a doctor or care provider for regular, ongoing primary care.”The Kelowna UPCC is one of three centres now open in Interior Health. Fourteen UPCCs have been announced throughout B.C. under the government’s primary-care strategy. The Kelowna UPCC is a partnership between the Ministry of Health, Interior Health, the Central Okanagan Division of Family Practice and the Doctors of BC. Interior Health also collaborated with the Westbank First Nation, patient partners and the Central Okanagan Regional Hospital District to develop the UPCC.The centre will provide urgent primary care for Central Okanagan residents by a team of health-care providers, including doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers and office staff.The centre will serve two purposes:\\nto provide care for people with non-life-threatening conditions who need to see a health-care provider within 12 to 24 hours, but don’t require an emergency department and who do not have or cannot access their family practitioner;\\nto help attach patients to a regular primary-care provider.\\nTo facilitate this, the centre will attach patients to health-care providers in the community in collaboration with the Central Okanagan Division of Family Practice. Unattached patients will be provided with ongoing wraparound care on an interim basis, while arranging for patients to be connected to other local practices for their care.Net new clinical staffing includes 22 full-time equivalent practitioners, including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, respiratory therapists and physiotherapists, working together to provide team-based care for patients.The Kelowna UPCC is located at 1141 Harvey Ave.This is the third UPCC to open in Interior Health, following the Vernon UPCC, which opened in October 2019, and the Kamloops UPCC that opened in June 2018. Since opening, the Vernon UPCC has had 1,274 patient visits and the Kamloops UPCC has had 20,810 patient visits.Learn More:B.C.’s UPCC locations can be viewed by visiting: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/bc-urgent-and-primary-care-centres.pdfTo learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043Two backgrounders follow.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nPeople experiencing poverty now have better access to income and disability assistance through a series of changes designed to give them the help they need, when they need it.“We took a careful look at the existing policies for income and disability assistance and asked if they’re helping or harming the people they are meant to support,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “All of these changes are removing unnecessary barriers that prevent people who were already struggling to get the support they need to break out of the cycle of poverty.”Changes to the Employment and Assistance Act and the Employment and Assistance for Persons with Disabilities Act and regulations took effect on Jan. 1, 2020. These include:\\nending the requirement for seniors to pursue Canada Pension Plan retirement benefits before the age of 65;\\nexpanding access to security deposits and introducing a pet damage deposit;\\namending the definition of spouse; and\\neliminating the two-year independence rule.\\nSimpson\\xa0made the announcement while meeting with one of the new community integration specialists (CIS) at the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre Society. Through the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, the CIS position is designed to bridge the gap between some of B.C.’s most vulnerable people and supports and services. CIS\\xa0workers go into communities to connect people to their local agencies and organizations.The CIS team and policy amendments are part of a cross-government effort to better connect people with the services they need. Barriers, like a lack of identification or a security deposit for a home, can prevent people from receiving important services, accessing income assistance or finding stable housing. Government is identifying and reducing barriers by updating policies and ensuring that the changes reach the people they are designed to help.The changes are part of a series of amendments. The first set of changes took effect in July 2019 and included expanding access to the identification supplement, removing the $10,000 asset limit on a primary vehicle and expanding the moving supplement for people to move anywhere in B.C. All of the changes reflect the principles of affordability, accessibility, social inclusion and reconciliation, as laid out in TogetherBC: British Columbia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.Delivering on the Poverty Reduction Strategy is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Susan Tatoosh, executive director, Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre Society –“A new partnership between the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre Society and the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction has a community integration specialist working in our office once a week and connecting one-on-one with the urban Indigenous people who we support here. Having a CIS team member in the office helps to streamline access to government services for urban Indigenous people who are experiencing poverty and homelessness, and recognizes the importance of VAFCS’s culturally based supports and services.”Adrienne Montani, provincial co-ordinator, First Call: B.C. Child and Youth Advocacy Coalition –“The elimination of the policy requirement that young adults are financially independent for two years before receiving income assistance will help vulnerable young adults get the support they need right away. This is an important change that will better support youth aging out of care, who already experience multiple barriers that prevent them from moving forward into adulthood. It is equally important for other youth who do not have family support during this important time in their transition to adulthood.”Learn More:Read TogetherBC: British Columbia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/poverty-reduction-strategyTo learn more about the July 2019 policy changes, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019SDPR0051-001379A backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nTwo public information meetings will be held in the Williams Lake area to provide details about wildfire risk reduction projects that will be completed over the next two years in areas where urban development borders on forested areas.The Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development will direct these risk reduction projects and\\xa0will host the following information sessions:\\nWednesday, Jan. 15, 2020\\n\\t7 p.m.\\n\\tWilliams Lake City Hall\\n\\t450 Mart St.\\n\\tWilliams Lake\\n\\nThursday, Jan. 23, 2020\\n\\t7 p.m.\\n\\tMiocene Community Hall\\n\\t3511 Horsefly Rd.\\n\\t150 Mile House\\nAt each of these meetings, a presentation from ministry staff will be followed by a question-and-answer session. FireSmart information will be available for residents who wish to reduce wildfire hazards on private property.Planned wildfire risk reduction projects in the Williams Lake area:Preliminary fieldwork for these projects began in\\xa0fall\\xa02019, and the treatments will continue periodically over the next two years. Areas with steep slopes, fuel hazards or weather patterns that could affect wildfire behaviour have been prioritized, as well as areas close to residences or critical infrastructure.A primary goal of these projects is to reduce the size and intensity of any future wildfires in the Williams Lake area, which will make it easier for firefighters to defend communities. Risk reduction activities may include:\\nremoving hazardous trees and flammable shrubs;\\nreducing accumulations of woody debris and other fuels on the forest floor;\\nthinning forested areas; and\\npruning low-hanging tree branches to help prevent fire from moving into the upper branches of trees.\\nAbout 1,200 hectares of interface land will be treated. Project areas include:\\nSouth Lakeside neighbourhood;\\nWilliams Lake River Valley;\\nHighway 97 South corridor from Broadway Avenue North to the White Road area;\\nHighway 97 North corridor near the Williams Lake Regional Airport;\\nSoda Creek Road and MacKenzie Avenue North area;\\nFox Mountain, including the Centennial Drive, Eider Drive and Pheasant Drive areas;\\nwest side of Dog Creek Road (south of Gibbon Road) and east side of Dog Creek Road (south of Gun A Noot Trail);\\nChimney Valley Road; and\\nHorsefly Road and Spokin Lake Road junction (Dewar Lake area).\\nIn addition to reducing wildfire risks to communities, these projects will improve the long-term health and resiliency of forests and enhance habitat for mule deer and other wildlife. Other important factors, such as recreational use, riparian areas and cultural values, were considered when planning\\xa0these projects.Many of the planned activities overlap the priority treatment areas identified in the Williams Lake and Area Community Wildfire Protection Plan, which was developed by multiple agencies, communities and First Nations. Ministry staff will continue to work closely with residents and First Nations as these projects get underway.The planned activities may temporarily limit public access to some trails in areas being treated. The ministry will advise the public of any lengthy closures, should they be required.Learn More: Wildfire risk reduction strategies: http://gov.bc.ca/wildfirepreventionRead about the FireSmart program or download the FireSmart Begins at Home manual: https://firesmartbc.ca/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nNew investments in the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) for sonography and cardiovascular perfusion programs will mean more graduates and better health care for people in British Columbia.“Students, health-care workers and patients have been calling on government to increase sonography training across the province for years, and we are answering that call with new and expanded programs in Northern B.C., Vancouver Island and now the Lower Mainland,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “We’re investing in BCIT so more students can train for dynamic and rewarding health-care careers and deliver the high-quality care British Columbians rely upon.”\\xa0Government is investing a total of $2.5 million. Funding of $880,000 will support the expansion of BCIT’s diagnostic medical sonography and cardiovascular perfusion programs.Eight first-year seats were added to the existing 32 sonography seats in September 2019. Another eight first-year seats will be added in 2020 for a total of 48 first-year seats.Capital funding of $1.6 million will allow purchase of the necessary sonography equipment. Beginning in 2020, the cardiovascular perfusion program will expand by three seats – by moving the program intake from seven students every two years to an annual intake of five students.“Our government wants to make sure people have even greater access to health care in B.C. We need even more caring, compassionate and well-trained people to make our health system work – from health sciences professionals to physicians and nurse practitioners,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Our announcement today will address the need for more health-care workers, which is one of the biggest challenges facing the health system.”In fiscal 2020-21, the Province will provide $640,000 in operating funding toward northern B.C.’s first sonography program at the College of New Caledonia (CNC). In addition, capital funding of $1.5 million has been provided for equipment and renovations at CNC. In October 2019, the Province also announced Vancouver Island’s first Diagnostic Medical Sonography program at Camosun College with one-time funding of $1.4 million.“BCIT was the first post-secondary to offer diagnostic sonography in B.C. and is one of only three institutions in Canada to teach cardiovascular profusion, both of which are critically important specialties in our growing health-care system,” said Kathy Kinloch, president, BCIT. “We are proud of the increasing number of graduates providing quality care to British Columbians, thanks to ongoing support from the provincial government. This funding helps ensure that we continue to provide state-of-the-art equipment and training to more skilled professionals essential to B.C.’s health-care workforce.”As B.C.’s population continues to age, health professionals are in increasingly high demand – the 2018 BC Labour Market Outlook projected 82,100 job openings in the health professions by 2028. Cardiovascular perfusionists and sonographers are two of the top 13 health professions identified as in high demand.Quotes:Janet Routledge, MLA for Burnaby North – “I’m delighted that students in my riding will have increased access to top-quality speciality health training at BCIT so they can train for in-demand jobs that will help build fulfilling and rewarding careers. Supporting students in these specialty positions will help deliver the high-quality health care that British Columbians need and deserve.”Danny Zaporozan, student, diagnostic medical sonography program, BCIT – “As students in the BCIT diagnostic medical sonography program, we not only learn from the best in the industry, we are also learning from instructors who will be our colleagues in the future. Our instructors are sonographers who provide us with hands-on experience for the real world. The training at BCIT is so practical and thorough, it makes me feel fully prepared to make a difference in the health-care world and to be an everyday hero in my job.”Quick Facts:\\nBCIT was the first public-sector institution in B.C. to offer a diagnostic medical sonography program.\\nMedical sonographers operate ultrasound equipment to capture images to aid physicians in diagnosis and treatment of medical disorders, and to monitor pregnancies.\\nDemand for ultrasounds has increased dramatically due to B.C.’s aging population and improvements to the technology and its capabilities. Increasing the number of training seats will help address that need and expand the capacity of health-service providers.\\nCardiovascular perfusionists are key members of highly specialized surgical teams. They provide life-saving support to patients undergoing heart and lung surgery by operating complex specialized equipment, such as a cardiopulmonary bypass machine (heart-lung machine), during surgery.\\nLearn More:For more information about health sciences programs at BCIT, visit: https://www.bcit.ca/path/health/\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nPeople and families living in Renfrew-Collingwood and surrounding neighbourhoods will soon have access to more quality primary health-care services with the launch of the new RISE Community Health Centre in April 2020.The Province is launching RISE Community Health Centre in collaboration with the Collingwood Neighbourhood House Society to provide comprehensive primary-care services to residents. Community health centres are community governed with services tailored to meet the health needs of the community they serve.\\xa0The centre\\xa0will be governed, owned and operated by Collingwood Neighbourhood House.“We’ve listened to people in Renfrew-Collingwood and are using our primary care strategy to build on the good work their community organizations are already doing,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “The RISE Community Health Centre will help connect more people with the health care they need when they need it. This will make a difference for people who have been struggling to access health-care services.”Located at 3425 Crowley Dr., RISE will offer comprehensive primary-care and health-promotion services. This includes attaching people without a primary-care provider to a family doctor or nurse practitioner, providing access to preventative and primary health-care services to patients with complex medical and social needs, mental health and addictions challenges and co-ordination of specialist care.Since November 2019, the health centre has been providing limited primary-care services through a small clinical space at Collingwood Neighbourhood House. It is currently accepting patients by referral from selected organizations and programs. Services at this site will continue when the main location opens, offering services such as chronic disease management, pregnancy, prenatal and postpartum care, mental-health assessment, treatment and support, medication prescription refills and health screenings, assessments and prescriptions.RISE will continue to expand its services and clinical team in the first two years of operation. Over time, patients will also benefit from additional health promotion and disease prevention activities such as a pharmacy dispensary, physiotherapy, nutrition support, counselling and patient education, as well as support to navigate health and social service systems.“RISE Community Health Centre would not be possible without the dedication and tireless efforts of the Collingwood Neighbourhood House Society,” said Dix. “Its passion and support for serving the community has made RISE a reality, and I thank everyone for their continued partnership in this project.”\\xa0The B.C. government will provide approximately $2.6 million operating budget once the centre reaches full capacity.Quick Facts: \\nIn April 2020, seven full-time equivalent staff will work at the RISE Community Health Centre’s main location and at Collingwood Neighbourhood House.\\nThe centre expects to have around 12,000 patient visits in the first year of operation.\\nCommunity health centres are not-for-profit or co-operative health-care organizations that deliver integrated, people-centred services and programs that reflect the needs of the communities they serve.\\nThere are approximately\\xa0100 community health centres that are run by health authorities, and 30 community-governed community health centres in British Columbia.\\nThese centres focus on integrating services and programs in primary care, health promotion, and community well-being, as well as working to address social determinants of health.\\nLearn More:To learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit:\\xa0https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043Two backgrounders follow.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

No one knows this better than Jennifer.“I’ve lived the devastation that is untreated alcohol addiction,” said Jennifer, whose last name is not being used for privacy reasons. “It tore my family apart.”For years, Jennifer’s now ex-husband struggled with his alcohol use, as have other members of her family.Her ex-husband’s alcohol addiction began several years ago. He would have a few drinks to wind down after a long day at work. But over time, that increased to having several drinks every night.He often lied about his use, replacing empty vodka bottles with water to hide the amount he drank, and Jennifer would find empty liquor bottles hidden around their home. At one point, he totalled his truck.\\xa0When Jennifer confronted him, he admitted he had a problem and said he would get help – a cycle that continued over and over again – but he never did. Even after speaking to her ex-husband’s doctor, he still did not receive the treatment he needed.As his drinking continued to escalate, so did his behaviour. Her husband became emotionally and verbally abusive, and Jennifer began to fear for her safety and the safety of her children.“I was struggling and dealing with anxiety and was pretty close to having a nervous breakdown because of all the lies, deceit and the denial,” Jennifer said, adding her kids’ relationship with their father suffered as a result. They struggled in school, and were often scared and had nightmares.\\xa0“I was so concerned, you could see the children breaking down. It was an extremely toxic and volatile environment. It was a matter of mental health and safety.”Jennifer’s husband soon lost his job because of his drinking and became so sick he was eventually hospitalized.After nearly two years of trying to help him overcome his addiction, Jennifer left in June 2018. While she admits she still feels guilty thinking about how she could have left him sooner or how she couldn’t get him the help he needed, she has channelled that energy into something positive.Jennifer is one of many with lived experience who lent their voices to help with the creation of a new made-in-B.C. guideline that physicians and clinicians can use to connect British Columbians who are dealing with high-risk drinking and alcohol-use disorder to services that meet their needs.Contributing to the new guideline, which was developed by the BC Centre on Substance Use, was an experience Jennifer believes has been therapeutic on her own pathway to recovery. The guideline is one she wishes had been around when her ex-husband was in the early stages of his addiction.\\xa0“I really think that it (the guideline) can offer families an opportunity to get the help that they need before it reaches a devastating point. The earlier the interception, the earlier the chance of recovery,” Jennifer said. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to sit on the board. It has helped me work through things – to grieve and to grow. It’s been a healing process.”The new guideline is a crucial step to help bridge the gap between research and practice. It will be used by physicians and clinicians to manage and treat high-risk drinking and alcohol-use disorder, resulting in more people accessing better, quality care.

       "  '\\n\\nThe BC Wildlife Health Program is asking for help assessing the effects of winter ticks on the province’s moose population as part of its annual moose winter tick surveillance program.The program relies on observations from wildlife professionals and the public to monitor the number of moose with hair loss and assess the amount of hair loss on each individual. This information is used to estimate the overall prevalence and distribution of winter ticks.Tick infestations can result in behavioural and physiological changes that may directly affect the survival rates of moose, especially in younger individuals. Winter ticks can contribute to moose population declines, especially when climate change and habitat conditions promote high tick numbers.Winter tick infestations can be observed on moose during January through April. The ticks spend the entire winter on one host. There can be tens of thousands of ticks on one moose.As the female ticks mature, they feed on the blood of the moose in late winter. The irritation causes moose to scratch and groom themselves excessively, resulting in hair loss and less time spent foraging or resting, which can lead to weight loss. The extent of hair loss on a moose can be observed easily from a distance and is a rough indicator of how many ticks are present.Anyone interested in contributing to this surveillance program can fill out a survey online. Alternatively, the electronic survey can be saved and completed on a computer, tablet or mobile device and returned via email to:\\xa0FLNRMooseTickSurvey@gov.bc.caAn online survey, downloadable survey forms and background information are available on the moose winter tick program website: www.gov.bc.ca/wildlifehealth/mooseticksurveyThe findings of the surveillance program will contribute to the Provincial Moose Research Program, which was initiated in 2013 to investigate factors influencing moose populations in British Columbia.For more information, email: FLNRMooseTickSurvey@gov.bc.caLearn More:Read the latest winter tick study report:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/plants-animals-and-ecosystems/wildlife-wildlife-habitat/wildlife-health/wildlife-health-documents/provincial_moose_winter_tick_program_report.pdfReview the provincial moose management plan:\\nhttp://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/wildlife/management-issues/docs/provincial_framework_for_moose_management_bc.pdf\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

This streamlines the provincial and municipal trip permitting process for travel to and from Lower Mainland ports and the Alberta border.This is expected to save the trucking industry time and increase confidence for carriers and shippers in order to attract more specialized products through B.C. ports.Project Cargo Corridor permits pre-approve\\xa0travel for commercial trucks between two major Lower Mainland ports (Fraser Surrey Docks and Lynnterm East Gate) and the Alberta border via Highway 16. The trucks are no longer required to complete the traditional extraordinary-load approval process.It applies to commercial vehicles with the following specifications:\\nconfiguration: eight-\\xa0to 13-axle superloads\\ngross combined vehicle weight: up to 125,000 kilograms\\noverall height: up to 4.88 metres\\noverall width: up to five\\xa0metres\\noverall length: up to 50 metres\\nOther loads of this size require an extraordinary-load approval, which can take up to 12 business days. This is because of the analysis required to ensure the vehicle’s weight and dimensions will not damage infrastructure along the trip route. By having pre-approved vehicle specifications and routing in place, trip approvals on these Project Cargo Corridors can occur within two business days.To make this happen, the ministry has signed information-sharing agreements with municipalities along the corridor, including the District of North Vancouver, the City of Vancouver, the City of Burnaby, the City of Langley, the Township of Langley, the City of Abbotsford and the City of Surrey.The BC Trucking Association and the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority also contributed to the development of Project Cargo Corridor permits.

       "  'B.C. Home Owner Grant confirmed for 2020',\n",
       "  \"\\n\\nThe 2020 homeowner grant threshold in British Columbia has been set at $1.525 million, maintaining that 92% of homeowners continue to be eligible for the B.C. Home Owner Grant.The threshold is down from $1.65 million in 2019 due to moderating housing prices throughout the province. The threshold has again been set to ensure the same percentage of residential property owners are below the threshold and eligible for the full, basic grant amount. In years prior, rapidly rising housing prices led to an increase in the threshold.The homeowner grant reduces the amount of property tax people pay to a municipality or to the Province for people who live in a rural area.The grant is reduced by $5 for every $1,000 of assessed value above the threshold, meaning eligible homeowners with properties assessed above the threshold receive a partial grant until it is fully phased out. Some low-income owners, such as seniors or people with disabilities, can also apply for a supplement that replaces any grant amount they lose due to the value of their home being over the threshold.The homeowner grant amounts are:\\nup to $570 for the basic homeowner grant.\\nup to $770 if the home is located in a northern or rural area. A “northern or rural area” means outside the Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley and Capital Regional districts.\\nup to $845 for homeowners who are 65 years or older, or if the homeowner is a person with a disability or lives with a relative who has a disability.\\nup to $1,045 for homes in northern or rural areas where the homeowner is 65 years or older, or the homeowner is a person with a disability.\\nThe B.C. government reimburses municipalities for the full cost of the grant to ensure local government tax revenues are not affected.Homeowners may also be eligible for property tax deferment if they are 55 years or older or are financially supporting a dependent child.Learn More:To apply for a B.C.

       "  '\\n\\nThe\\xa0new year marks the end of Medical Services Plan (MSP) premiums, saving B.C. families up to $1,800 a year and individuals up to $900 a year.While MSP premiums are a thing of the past as of Jan. 1, 2020, here are some important reminders for British Columbians.British Columbians who had been paying their premiums using auto-payments through their credit card or financial institution are reminded to cancel those automated payments.British Columbians must also keep their address up to date, which can be done online at: www.gov.bc.ca/managingyourmspaccountAlthough British Columbians will no longer be invoiced for new premiums starting Jan. 1, 2020, elimination of MSP premiums does not forgive outstanding premiums owed.People may be eligible for relief on premium amounts still owing. For example, retroactive premium assistance could be provided based on net income for a given tax year, family size and disability status.\\xa0Although British Columbians no longer pay premiums, they must remain enrolled in MSP. The plan will continue to provide eligible B.C. residents with provincially insured health-care benefits.For questions about making a payment or account balances, contact Revenue Services of BC, Monday to Thursday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; or Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Pacific time) at 1 877 405-4909 (toll-free).For questions about retroactive premium assistance, or to update a MSP account, contact Health Insurance BC, Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (Pacific time) at 1 800 663-7100 (toll-free) or 604 683-7151 (Lower Mainland).Learn More:To learn more about the elimination of MSP premiums in B.C., visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019PREM0126-002326To learn more and to apply for retroactive premium assistance, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/msp/bc-residents/premiums/retroactive-premium-assistanceA backgrounder follows.\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe first anniversary of a $105-million investment over three years in Fair PharmaCare deductibles and co-payments shows that the changes are making a real difference in people’s lives.“In the first three months since government made the changes to Fair PharmaCare, around 88,300 more lower-income families have benefited,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “This means fewer people are having to make the difficult choice when going to the grocery store between either buying food and daily necessities for their family or prescription medicine.”After expanding Fair PharmaCare, the number of families earning up to $30,000\\xa0that received paid drug benefits during the first three months of the year increased from 63,600 during January to March 2018, to 151,900 during January to March 2019, an increase of 88,300 families.These changes made to Fair PharmaCare mean that households earning up to $30,000 in net income annually no longer pay deductibles and the provincial government pays 70% of their eligible prescription drug costs right away.Previously, a household earning a net annual income between $15,000 and $30,000 would have to pay between $300 and $600 in deductibles before Fair PharmaCare would start to provide coverage assistance.“This was the first-ever change to Fair PharmaCare deductibles and co-payments since the program was created 16 years ago,” Dix said. “Previously, anyone registered with Fair PharmaCare, even people with the lowest incomes, would have to pay out-of-pocket before receiving 100% coverage. For example, under the previous coverage levels, a family earning $11,250 net a year was required to spend $200 on\\xa0prescription drug co-payments before PharmaCare would cover the full cost of eligible prescription drugs.”Ministry of Health data\\xa0show a link between low-income levels, deductibles and decreased drug spending, indicating that families will forgo filling prescriptions due to the cost of deductibles and co-payments. They will opt for other essentials, such as housing and groceries.“A dollar only stretches so far, and no one understands this more than people living on low incomes,” said Gudrun Langolf, president, Council of Seniors Citizens’ Organizations of B.C. “Choosing between food or prescriptions is a reality many seniors faced, and I applaud the B.C. government for taking the long-awaited action to provide relief and make it easier for people to get the prescriptions they need.”The provincial government has also made life more affordable for British Columbians by eliminating Medical Service Plan premiums, saving individuals up to $900 a year and families as much as $1,800 a year.“I have been a pharmacist for more than 12 years and can tell you medication affordability is always among the top concerns that patients have,” Keith Shaw, president, BC Pharmacy Association and pharmacy district manager at Sobeys, which operates Safeway. “I want to thank B.C.’s pharmacists for their important role in ensuring the introduction of Fair PharmaCare was as seamless as possible for our patients. Providing accessible, affordable health care for British Columbians is something that B.C.’s pharmacists are proud to support.”This plan for enhanced coverage for essential medicines for lower-income British Columbians involved collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus, and is a foundational step toward the Confidence and Supply Agreement commitment to address prescription drug costs.Learn More:To learn more and register with Fair PharmaCare,\\xa0visit: www.gov.bc.ca/fairpharmacareTo learn more about the change, visit:\\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/pharmacare-for-bc-residents/who-we-cover/fair-pharmacare-plan/fair-pharmacare-changes-in-2019To see a summary table of the changes, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Fair_PharmaCare_Changes_Table.pdfTo view a table of the benefits,\\xa0visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Patient-and-Family-Beneficiary-Counts.pdfTo learn more about PharmaCare and its other coverage plans, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/pharmacare-for-bc-residents/who-we-cover\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

       "  '\\n\\nSelina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, has released the following statement regarding BC Assessment’s release of the 2020 property assessments:“As the 2020 property assessments are released, people living in the regions hardest hit by sky-high property-value increases are seeing a moderating trend in housing prices. For the second year in a row, we see only modest changes in the value of both single-family and strata homes in most regions, particularly in the Lower Mainland and on Vancouver Island.“This is a positive sign that our government’s efforts to make housing more affordable for more British Columbians are having a real impact. For too long, the previous government sat back and watched housing prices climb well out of the reach of average people. Younger generations were shut out of the market and many abandoned hope to ever own a home or felt forced to leave the province to start a family.“We are encouraged by signs that property values are continuing to stabilize, giving more certainty for those investing in multi-family buildings, more stability for current homeowners and improved opportunity for those entering the market.“As we move into the next decade, we will continue our work to stabilize the market and support investment in new housing supply, while we ensure that more families and businesses are able to be part of our economic success.”\\n\\n \\n']]"
